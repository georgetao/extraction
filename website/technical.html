            </h2>
            <p>To enable our project vision, we needed to build a system that is able to detect action items present in a given email, and then summarize them appropriately. We approached these two necessary actions by framing them as two fundamental tasks of Natural Language Processing: text classification and text summarization. Text classification is used to determine which sentences contain action items and text summarization is used to make a succinct summary of each action item. </p>

                  <p class="mb-0">Under the hood, Extraction uses a text classifier and a text summarizer to perform its signature function (summarizing action items). Therefore, to build Extraction, we required two distinct datasets for training the classifier and the summarizer individually. To curate these two specialized datasets, we drew natural language data from one primary source: the Enron Email Corpus<sup>1</sup>, a dataset of approximately 500,000 naturally written emails from the Enron Corporation in the early 2000s. It is currently the largest publicly available collection of naturally written language in an organizational setting.</p>

                  <h4>Action Sentence Detection Dataset:</h4>
                  <p class="mb-0">Extraction’s operative text classifier determines whether or not a particular segment of text contains an action item. The segment of text serving as our unit of analysis is the sentence. In other words, the text classifier is trained to evaluate whether a single sentence contains an action item.  Although It is possible for multiple distinct action items to be expressed in a single sentence (and also for a single sentence’s action item to depend heavily on previous sentences), according to our preliminary analyses and exploration, the sentence remains the unit most likely to contain exactly one distinct action item. Therefore, we curated a dataset of sentences and their associated labels (1/0) indicating whether there is an action item present in each sentence. We refer to a sentence containing an action item as an action sentence for short.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">To create this dataset, we merged several disparate labeled portions of the Enron Corpus. The most important of which is the EPA Dataset<sup>2</sup>  for addressee tagging created by researchers at Microsoft. The dataset is a list of Enron email messages containing highlighted strings which express tasks to be done by the recipient. We wrote a Python script to parse the EPA data and retrieve the sentence to which the highlighted task belongs as well up to 3 sentences that come before the action sentence. To balance out the action sentences (positives, 1s), we pulled non-action sentences (negatives, 0s) from the Email Intent Dataset<sup>3</sup> created by Parakweet Labs as well as the UC Berkeley Enron Email Analysis Project<sup>4</sup>. The product of merging email sentences from the various sources discussed above is the Action Sentence Detection Dataset, which we then used to train Extraction’s action sentence classifier.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Action Item Summarization Dataset:</h4>
                  <p class="mb-0">To train an action item summarizer, we curated a dataset which associates action sentences and their preceding sentences with summaries of the action items. We prepended up to three preceding sentences of each action sentence because these preceding sentences tend to contain details that are important to fully understanding the action item.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">To curate this dataset, members of our team summarized approximately 4,000 action sentence examples. To make the summaries as generalizable as possible and also minimize the influence of members’ personal linguistic dispositions in the summaries, we adhered to a set of guidelines when summarizing the action items. The primary guiding principles of the guidelines emphasize clarity, conciseness, and extractive-ness (using words present in the input text).</p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">Finally, to supplement our dataset of 4,000 instances we used the Wikihow Dataset5, consisting of WikiHow article paragraphs and summaries for each of them. The WikiHow summaries are amenable to the task of action item summarization because these summaries, like our action item summaries, are in the imperative mood. We use nearly 1 million instances from the WikiHow dataset for pre-training before fine-tuning the model on our own curated dataset.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">We chose to use fastText, a hierarchical text classification model developed in the Facebook AI Research Lab, after comparing it to multiple baseline and deep learning models. We found fastText to be on par with the deep learning models in terms of accuracy while also being extremely fast and easy to train.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">For ExtrAction, computational efficiency is especially important because the model will have to evaluate in real time on multiple sentences. fastText is efficient on large datasets because it is a hierarchical classifier. Categories are arranged on a tree which reduces training and testing time from linear to logarithmic. Additionally, the tree is built using the Huffman algorithm which leads to more computational efficiency by allowing the model to exploit natural class imbalances.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">After considering both performance and pre-existing libraries available to us, we eventually settled on using a Pointer-Generator Network, invented by Abigail See in 2017, to use as a model for summarizing action items. This choice was our first because some of the Pointer Generator’s signature features are particularly favorable to ExtrAction’s business context.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">The Pointer-Generator is both an extractive and an abstractive summarization architecture. At each step in producing a summary, the model chooses between using a token from the input text or one from the vocabulary it is trained with. Experiments in the literature have shown that, more often than not, the pointer generator chooses to “point” or copy a token from the input sequence. This feature is critical to our task because the model is likely to see important tokens which are outside its known vocabulary quite often in the context of business. For example, if an action sentence says “Please send a copy of our agreement to Rowan Cassius”, chances are high that the names Rowan and Cassius are out of vocabulary (OOV). This is not a problem for the pointer generator because it can simply point to “Rowan” and then “Cassius” when producing a summary and does not need to have decent vector representations for every name.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">Additionally, we made customizations to the vanilla pointer-generator described by Abigail See by using pre-trained GloVe word vectors, action and context segment embeddings and customized named entity merging and coding.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">When it comes to Extraction’s user interface, we wanted to stay true to Extraction’s primary mission of simplifying the lives of its users. As a result, our UI design prioritizes a simple and straightforward user experience and all the features we’ve decided to add were deemed necessary and irreplaceable. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">The primary feature of Extraction is the generated list of action items. We wanted the main view of the extension to focus on the list of action items to make it as easy as possible for users to access this information. We wanted to let users manipulate the action items however they chose to do. Every feature we decided to include supplements this list, while not simultaneously disrupting the simplicity of the extension.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">We originally planned on creating a system that could pull a batch of emails at a time and automatically turn them into action items. However, gmail authentication and scraping proved to be a difficult and imprecise task, so we decided to include the text box to allow users to correct possible errors or simply paste emails into the text box and forego the scraping process if they so chose to.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="mb-0">Our final user interface maintains the original design concept of simplicity, while also including all the features we deemed necessary to create a functional and exportable to-do list.</p>

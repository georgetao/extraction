       "4  The impact is potentially that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate transport/gathering agreements, etc. If any rates are changing, then those need to be changed in our systems also. There may be other areas of changes also - I'm not attempting to list them all. Rather I just want to make people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations.

Eliasson is very well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow up and wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful. I've asked his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in Houston on their next trip. Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging in 50M.   \n",

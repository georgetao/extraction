I live in Garden Oaks which is located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the Heights .		
Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put in open drainage which is basically ditches in the front of all the properties .		
Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches.		
My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale approximately 2,500 feet .		
I have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 for about the last 4 years generally once a month to ask them to please come out and regrade our ditches.		
The Public Works Department only has records over the last year because they changed their computer system and lost many files including mine.		
For the last year or so I have been receiving a more positive response when I call which is: This is a Code 1 priority and will schedule as work load allows.		
Although this response is encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears.		
Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might help expedite this work request.		
I would be extremely grateful if there is anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.	1

Buenos Nachos, Scott Sent by Go2net Mail		
I cannot give you a personal recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a trade secret or as a patented commodity.		
I ultimately struck a compromise position by filing my own provisional patent application.		
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office.		
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.		
Of these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for your son's software idea.		
He talked as though he had a particular specialty in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.		
He practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number 408 282-18		
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.		
Basic information and forms can be downloaded from there.		
Two other, newer sites might also intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of intellectual property, patents, etc.		
They are: pl-x.com The Patent and License Exchange, Inc. yet2come.com Hope this is helpful.		
Regards, Larry Thorne

Who would have guessed that the California power crisis and Gray Davis could be so funny.	0	Rowan
Kevin Los Angeles Daily News Friday, June 22, 2001 'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis By Fred Shuster Staff Writer BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday, doing his part for the state's energy crisis, but viewers weren't left in the dark.	0	Rowan
Flashlights, mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only The Tonight Show Unplugged, which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month.	0	Rowan
IMAGE The unplugged edition of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno pokes fun at the California power crisis Reed Saxon / A.P.	0	Rowan
Call it NBC's Can't See TV.	0	Rowan
This is not some cheap rating ploy.	0	Rowan
If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night, Leno joked as part of his opening monologue.	0	Rowan
The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov.	0	Rowan
Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began.	0	Rowan
Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas.	0	Rowan
The city made 5 million in profit in May after racking up 60 million in excess power sales.	0	Rowan
But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month.	0	Rowan
Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument.	0	Rowan
The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno.	0	Rowan
Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set.	0	Rowan
This is real goofy, Leno said before taping got under way.	0	Rowan
We'll see what happens.	0	Rowan
Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor.	0	Rowan
Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, This is the first time Gray Davis and the word electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence.	0	Rowan
Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model.	0	Rowan
While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs.	0	Rowan
Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, I've been operating in the dark for years.	0	Rowan
Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program.	0	Rowan
It was cool, said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La.	0	Rowan
The crowd got really involved.	0	Rowan
I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights.	0	Rowan
Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, It was a good idea and a great way to make a point.	0	Rowan
The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed.	0	Rowan
Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.	0	Rowan
I particularly recommend mistakes and mediocrity.	0	Rowan
I'm sorry to clog up your email in boxes, but I found the attached to be pretty interesting.	0	Rowan

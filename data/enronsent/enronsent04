Yes, I'm taking off tomorrow.  Wish you could too.  I'm planning on taking Chad to the Zoo.

That will work for me.  I assume you will be taking tomorrow off.  Good for
you.  I love you.

Hi Cyndi,

Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for
dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends
at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How
does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound? 

 Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take
Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her --
as I have given her the day off tomorrow.

Hi,

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  Chad had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow.  Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?  When is Tom home from school - so he and Chad could play.  Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with Kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend.

Two other items when you get a chance:
-Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?  I can't recall the date.
-Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at Enron.  I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.

Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Shelley

Per Jan's recent Commission meeting summary I just noticed the Commission had added a discussion item on OFOs.  They didn't get to this at yesterday's meeting, but will take up on Oct. 11.  Help Joe -- what is this about?  Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?  This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.  Where/when can we make our case.
RE:
G-33. DOCKET# GX01-1 000 Discussion of Gas Pipeline Operational Flow Orders 

Could you please send some insight into the Gas Pipeline Operational flow i=
tem?

The Commission meeting yesterday, chaired by Pat Wood, consisted of discuss=
ions on FERC's:

Administrative Issues
?=09Strategic and 2002 Business Plan
Priorities for the strategic plan for 2001 through 2005 were outlined yeste=
rday and include a) promoting secure, high-quality environmentally responsi=
ble energy infrastructure with consistent policies; b) encouraging competit=
ive markets in lieu of traditional regulation; c) protection of markets/cus=
tomers through fair market oversight; and d) efficiently running FERC. In r=
eaching these goals, FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impe=
diments to market investment, encouraging use of new technology; continuing=
 to advance competitive markets; addressing landowner, safety and environme=
ntal concerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as c=
ost recovery but also in communications to stakeholders. Shortly, Staff wil=
l be recommending a twelve-month plan as part of the overall strategic plan=
.
?=09Infrastructure Adequacy
There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the U.S.=
 beginning in November in the West; in December or early spring a meeting w=
ill be held in the northeast and later in 2002 for the Midwest and south. T=
he intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion.
?=09California Infrastructure Update
Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for take-away capaci=
ty was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity. The Cali=
fornia Energy Commission released a report on September 24 that agrees that=
 more expansion in California is needed.=20

Constraint Study
FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be =
completed by November 7, 2001. Staff cited constraints in central New York =
state and California. Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or=
 recommendations. It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the r=
esulting costs to consumers.

RTO
FERC is imposing additional "incentives" to encourage the formation or join=
ing in RTOs. The Midwest, Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered a=
t a FERC meeting in October. There will be a series of meetings in "RTO wee=
k" to focus on congestion management, cost recovery, marketing monitoring, =
transmission planning, reliability standards and transmission rights. A NOP=
R is expected to be issued on market design and structure.

Marketing Affiliate NOPR, RM01-10
The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both n=
atural gas pipelines and electric utilities. Under the proposal, transmissi=
on providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondis=
criminatory basis.  The rules would be codified in a new section of the reg=
ulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all "ener=
gy affiliates."  The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusi=
on of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) from the definition of ene=
rgy affiliates.   =20

The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of th=
e rule to public utilities' native load merchant functions.     =20

Option A:  Status Quo - the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merc=
hant function.
Option B:  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and wou=
ld prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of th=
e utility.=20

After extensive discussion, the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional langu=
age added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may no=
t be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties =
and the States.

Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the =
definition of "energy" affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affi=
liates that would be exempt. Staff responded that the emphasis is on broade=
ning the definition to include all "energy affiliates" and no energy-type m=
arketing affiliates would be exempt, except RTO's.

The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certai=
n information to all "energy affiliates".  The rules do not directly govern=
 energy affiliates, but they govern the disclosure of information and the s=
eparation of transmission employees, officers and directors from other busi=
nesses.=20

Under the proposal, waivers may be requested, if operationally required or =
under emergency protocols particularly for small systems.

Gas Pipeline Operational Flow
FERC has tabled this item for the next public meeting on October 11.=20

Suzanne,
 
Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.
 
I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.
 
Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably sometime next week?
 
I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be taking.  You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me tomorrow.
 
 

Shelley,
 
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
 
Sorry for the delay. 
 
Suzanne  
 
 
Dear Suzanne, 
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please 
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite 
102, 
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in 
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital 
section. 
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned 
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is 
the 
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to 
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is 
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that 
"the 
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would 
be 
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian 
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a 
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan. 
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any 
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to 
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a 
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends 
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything 
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me.

This order is even better.  It says that courts have founds that any refussal to allow a correction must be proportionate with the mistake.

http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/GAS/TM/TM996-29.00C.TXT

Is the system running ok this morning?

http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/GAS/TM/TM996-29.00E.TXT

A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint

1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.  

2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).

3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case.

Catherine,

Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.   

This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.  

We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.

We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.

Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.  

In His Name,

Oops my mistake.  I've lost track of my dates & was thinking that Winefest was several weeks off.  Its next week!

I'd love to but I will be drinking wine in Italy! Thanks for inviting me to
lunch today. I'm sorry I couldn't make it. I look forward to seeing you
Thursday night! Love, C

Would you be my guest?
>  -----Original Message-----

Meet you downstairs at 5:50 -- that way we'll hit the HOV at "2" person time.

That would be great.  How about around 5:45--6pm?  Not sure when you were thinking of leaving.  I've got plenty to keep me busy 'til 6.

I'm flexible on the departure time

Can I get on the list to get a copy of the Socal billing issue complaint draft ?

Would you be my guest?
Thank you for your hard work and your continued commitment to the March of Dimes. 

Enron's 2001 WalkAmerica campaign was the #14 Walk Team in Houston, contributing $72,563 to the March of Dimes. In addition, Danny McCarty was the #2 fundraiser in the city, raising $20,350, and Sophie Patel was the #5 fundraiser, raising $10,002.

In appreciation of all your efforts for WalkAmerica and the March of Dimes, you and a guest are invited to the 2001 March of Dimes' WineFest on Thursday, October 4 from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. at the Crystal Ballroom of the Rice Hotel. It will be a great evening of food, wine, friends, and a silent auction.

Please let me know by Friday, September 28, if you will be able to attend WineFest 2001.

Thank you, again, and hope to see you there.

I have rates and capacity utilization info ready.  I'll call you whan I get to the office.

Yes I will attend & I will bring a guest

Ricki - Jean has been terrific in handling half a dozen emergencies this summer and the move logistics.  I would like to give her a gift from the gas logisitics team.  Should we send her flowers or do you have any other ideas?

I'm flexible on the departure time

Letter looks good.  Just a few thoughts:

- In addition to the categories of feedback and promise to work on these areas, should we provide a list of specific things that we have done?
- Should we attach the first round of FAQ that matches questions from the meeting?

Instead of referring to the ETS directors - lets put Lynn, Steve and your phone numbers in the letter?

 << File: winterops_followup.doc >> 

Here is a new draft.  Edit at will...

Here are my additional suggestions

Toby,

Could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings.  Maybe I'm going at this the wrong way, but when I try to pull up a specific outage posting, I always get a whole set of outage postings.  For example when I try to pull up the chaim of postings related to the NNG MOPs 831 outage, I can't just pull up the specific posting, I also get other outages.  Why can't each outage posting be its own document?

Toby,

Can you please provide me with a complete set of all the postings & extentions related to the outage to remove the MOPS 831 platform (starting around Aug 24 and continued several times). 

Andy - I may join by phone, depending on logistics this afternoon.  I'll let you know.

Jackie,

Here is the Children's Church newsletter article:

Children's Church Update

A children's worship service is held each Sunday (except for Communion Sundays) during the 11:00 worship service.   Children attend the first part of the regular worship service in the Sanctuary and then proceed to children's church after the children's sermon.  Please tend to your child's personal needs before worship, so our children's church leaders can focus on teaching.

The mission of children's church is to help prepare children (ages 3 years through 3rd grade) to participate in worship.  This Fall the children are learning that our "church backpack" is filled with things that help us worship -- our bibles, hymns, offering, and prayer.  Ask your child about how to make a prayer sandwich!

Thanks
Shelley
713-853-7083

P.S.  Please send me your daughter's email when you have a chance.

Thanks looks good.  I guess I just have a chip on my shoulder these days about being relegated to the world of details!

Here's the latest draft--this is on the way over to staff right now. I'll make sure all future settlement stuff goes to you. Thanks.

Per discussion with Drew and Joe, here are some mods which I think mitigate our internal issue on an interactive open season and what that means.   Please provide any comments asap and then Robyn can take the document, unredline and submit to Staff for us.  Which should be doable today,   Mary Kay << File: TranswesternSettlementOffer1.doc >> 

I agree.  We need to get moving if we stand any chance at all of beating the ID from the Judge.  If we are ready w/ the document, I move we have Robin send and call as discussed.

Here's what I'd like to do on this--we'll just take out the word
"interactive" in describing the open season we're proposing to use for
operational capacity.  I think Staff will come back and ask for an
interactive process, but we can address that issue when and if we get to
the next step.  Again, this initial offer is mostly designed to simply
get the process rolling and to flush Staff out on whether they are
serious or not.  We won't start putting meaning into the very broad
concepts in the outline unless Staff comes back with a serious interest
in settling.  Thanks.  df

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

 

I will be thinking of you
I will be out of the office tomorrow returning on Monday October 29th.  If you need immediate assistance, please contact Ava Garcia at x35842.

These both track with the last drafts that I saw and commented on.  

Attached is the letter that will go out today for Gulfstream plus a point sheet.  If you have any issues please let me know by lunchtime.  

 << File: gulfstream-sf.doc >>  << File: gulstreampointsheet.doc >> 

When it comes to commitments involving website postings, scheduling or balancing, could I please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposals.  It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts -- just to make sure that I understand what is involved in complying.

In the case of the Transwestern setttlement offer -- my only comment/concern is that I would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the GISB rules -- otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes. 
"Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board,
consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. " 

Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of?

Here is what I started working on yesterday -- it isn't very far along.

 

Ricki -- I think it's working.  

Sarah,

Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  

For example, for calendar year 1997:
Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues
Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.

Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.

Call me at x37083 if you have questions.

 

FYI
We received a request from Citizens Communications Company immediately terminating their agency agreement with ENA for the following TW contracts

20822, 20834, 26791, 26580.

PLE and CBS have been updated.

Please send to all ETS Gas Logistics

In the never ending world of changes at Enron, upper management has determined that we will not be using the PEP system for feedback this year.   I apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews.   I have not received word on whether ETS year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form.  

As a result of this development, the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled.

Joceyln,

I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.

Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.

Thanks

Hi Ginger & Chris,

Hope you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.

When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.  

After I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email.  
I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?

I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston. 

Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.

Can you please check whether the 401K withdrawal was received on your end.  It looks like it left my account.

Also can you tell whether the check in from Bank One cleared?  It doesn't look like its in the account either.

Rod,
 
Do you know how to get in touch with Paul Cherry or Dan Fancler over the weekend?
I have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for TW for the bankruptcy lawyers -- including contract lists and receivables.  I need to have someone run a payables list.
 
I can be reach via blackberry or on cell 713-857-2103

FYI - This is what the supply breakdown looks like for FPL without ENA in the equation

 

Just got off the phone with Jennie and I know you already talked to her. 

My direct flight tomorrow cleared so I plan on taking it.  I will pray really hard that you can join me on the 20th & then we can spend some of our waiting time together.

It's been a few days now since ENA dropped their gas supply from ENA from 250M down to approx 75-85M and FPL has settled into a pattern of how it is replacing the ENA gas and still keeping its nominations at 800M.

Sarah,

Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  

For example, for calendar year 1997:
Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues
Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.

Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.

Call me at x37083 if you have questions.

 

Good morning all.

Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday. Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.  Help?  Can someone pull this together quickly for me?

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

Gary,

Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control.  

The only place we can put all the food will be right outside your office.  I could have some tables put up there...

Good Morning,

	I have been instructed to inform the people who have scheduled Conference Room 42C1 in the month of December, that we have to reschedule all meetings. Below are the meetings that have been scheduled and we will have to work together so that we can put everyone into a new room. 

Alva Ashe - 12/3, 12/10, 12/17, 12/24, 12/31
Erica Fields - 12/3, 12/10
Bernadette Etienne - 12/4, 12/6
Cindy Adams - 12/4, 12/11, 12/18
Kay Webb - 12/5, 12/19
Lillian Villarreal - 12/6
Shirley Crenshaw - 12/7

Please verify that this is taken care of and that I do not need to have someone in my group work on this.  Thanks.

Shelley, have seen this request to provide information to INGAA?
- If you have not seen, can your group provide without much problem?

- If you seen and have provided, could I get a copy to review?

Thanks
Keith

Keith,  please coordinate getting this info asap-  so we can send it back to INGAA-  Steve,  do you have of this?  MK

In order to give some concrete statistics for our argument that midstream and  production affiliates are important links in the infrastructure with affiliated  pipelines (and, of course, that applying the NOPR to pipeline affiliates would  be a disaster), please provide data to answer the following three questions. Our  customer operations guys tell me this is a pretty straigtforward exercise.O bviously, given the 13 days until comments are due, time is of the essence. So  please respond by COB Tuesday, if possible.
1. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from an affiliated interstate pipeline? For all these interconnects, how much  gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
2. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from affiliated gatherers, processors, or intrastate pipelines? For all these  interconnects, how much gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
3. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that deliver gas  into affiliated intrastate pipelines? For all these interconnects, how much gas  flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
Additionally, Michael Doane, the economist INGAA has retained, would like to  have the following information for his report. It can be anecdotal, but having  something concrete to point at is critical. He needs all the examples we can  provide of existing infrastructure (gathering-to-pipeline,  processing-to-pipeline, production-to-affiliated gathering and pipeline) that  would not have gone forward if pipelines were not allowed to coordinate with  their midstream and production affiliates. If at all possible, state the natural  gas deliverability that's there today, which would not have been there. under  the proposed rule.
As you'd suspect, this also has to be done as quickly as possible. Get the  information to me, and I'll forward it to Michael.
Thanks for your help.

I'm forwarding this so you know what is going on when there is a $181.17 deduct from my 12/31 paycheck.
Due to the Bankruptcy Filing on December 2, 2001, a decision was made to discontinue the flexperq allowance.  This decision was made after the December 14 payroll run.  You will receive your allowance of $181.17 on your December 14 paycheck; however,  Payroll will reduce your 12/31 paycheck for the same amount.

Also, please note that executive physicals will no longer be offered or related expenses covered by Enron.

Thank you!

FYI

FYI - FPL conducted a "test" wire yesterday and successfully sent a penny to our new Citibank account.  We should not have to worry about half of FGT's cash coming in today...

Shelley,  FYI--Rick & I have discussed how we will cover the reservation billing scheduled for Saturday.  Marion & Cynthia will assist us in the coverage as well as Jerry Skirtich who sat  with Galen & I on Tuesday to cover the ncessary steps to generate the billing process.  Galen has a "desk procedure manual" assembled that spells out in detail the billing process.  I'm working w/Larry Hill to ensure the Capacity Release transactions are fed to the old TSS system (still testing this process.)  I've expressed a great sense of urgency surrounding the invoicing process given the cash flow concerns we're dealing with.  Sheila 

Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.

Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  

1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities
	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.

	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South
	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. 

	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and
	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.

	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation
	Center (EB42C1). 

2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone 
	
	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. 
	
On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics
business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, 
and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to
support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks, depending on events.

 
Here is the presentation for the 2:30 meeting today

The offers to help you keep rolling in.  

Shelley, I wish you the best of luck and God's blessings on your trip!
Hopefully, all will go smoothly.  We will be praying for you and Alina.  If
there is something I can help Kim and Chad with while you are gone, or some
help you need when you get back, please don't hesitate to ask.  We are here
to help!!

Attached is a copy of an outline of the children's Christmas Eve service
that 
I reviewed with Patty last night.  I have delivered a hard copy of the 
outline and readings to the Church Office.  Sorry to dash off an email 
without calling everyone -before I leave town.

Nancy - I'm hoping that you are still amenable to playing the piano.  If you

have selections that you prefer -- feel free to change my selections.  They 
were picked only because the kids know these songs.  It is particularly a
joy 
to hear them sing the chorus of "The First Noel."

Babara Thompson - I was hoping that you could ask the children at children's

church whether any of them are interested in volunteering to read for the 
worship .

Stephanie - I am hoping that you can line up an adult leader willing to play

overall MC and to read the Christmas message.  If you find someone- please 
let Patty know.  Otherwise I think she may be amenable to pinchhit.

Lisa C. - Could you please line up a greeter/door tender for the worship.  
And, also check with the trustees to make sure the sanctuary is unlocked in 
time.

Thanks everyone.  I just lover rattling off email orders!

Please add to my contact list

Shelley-

Just to let you know I am thinking if you.  Please let me know how you are
doing.  Take care.

	Unfortunately I will be on vacation on November 26th.  However, Gary will be attending and is well versed and postured to speak to 16 and 31 day charted PD measurement.  Gary has been working behind the scenes with your group, the field, marketing and technology to resolve the problems associated with equipment not suited for providing adequate daily information.  At the same time he has been working on gaining assistance in getting 16 day measurement data into the office on time for processing and review prior to month's end close.   Just as a side note, I understand now that Charlie Thompson of the Measurement Technology Group and Tech Ops has been given the charge to come up with a five year plan for installing automated and adequate equipment accross the board for these situations.

Ellis

Ellis/Gary

I hope that you can both make it to the meeting on Monday to discuss the issue of daily NNG measurement readings.  A number of our NNG customers are protesting DDVC invoices based on our inability to provide daily measurement information.   Alliant is just the latest in the string of customers.   The NNG marketing group is very frustrated on this issue.  

We need to put all our collective talents together.  This issue needs the highest levels of attention possible from measurement.

Reminder, the meeting to discuss the Alliant measurement issue is at 3:30 Monday in 49c2. sj

	Shelley, we have been working with a number of Business and IT managers with the termination of IT Consultants.  In some cases, major IT projects have been cancelled and consultants have been eliminated.  There is one project at ETS, the rewrite of the contracts system, that was being staffed by some outside IT consultants ( Valtech).  Has that project been put on hold or discontinued?  If it has and the consultants are no longer here, GSS needs to be in the loop to send termination letters to the supplier.  There is specific termination language in the Master Services Agreements that we manage.  

	Please let me know the status to the project or direct me to the person who can help me.

	Thanks

Final approval received!  I have an executed document signed by Williams and Danny McCarty.  Cash in amount of $268,702 is forthcoming.

Yes, I will keep you posted.  They have another level of approval left.  If that happens, we will receive either check or wire.

Is this cash coming into TW?

FYI - I made my staff burn the midnight oil last night putting together TW/NNG revenue summaries for review by the bankers that Rod/Kevin are working with.  Thought you might me interested in the report.  It gives a nice snapshot of our activity with our major counterparties.

First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).

Alma,
 
Please send out to the TW team.

Diane,

Cindy replied back to ask you to take my contribution out of the payroll system.  And, that I should then call UW to bill me directly.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Hi Cindy,

I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb.  (unsual bonus time).  Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.  I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.   ????

That's my understanding as well.

Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.  

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.    So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.  The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.  

Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.    

At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.

Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.

I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.

Please come by to sign the certificates.

Hope your holiday was a fantastic one.

My dossier info was not picked up from the embassy last week, so now I'm another week behing in the process.  But, the delay does perhaps give me a chance to take care of my sinus problem.  I've still been feeling cruddy and want to have a specialist look at the sinus polyp.  Can you recommend an ENT?

Looking forward to seeing you soon.

Hi Becky,

I'm thinking of you.  Cynthia Corcoran called today to see if I knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work.  I thought of you right away and Cynthia was enthusiastic, but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address.

She can be reached at 713-533-9180 or I can give her your contact info if you prefer.

Today Chris called to tell me that Liz Gras will not be traveling with me and that I should leave on Dec 15 instead of Dec 13 (Tomorrow).   This is all a shock.
I will have to travel by myself.  I have never traveled internationally before and I am a bit scared -- as I'm sure that you were this past summer when you visited.  I know everyone in Kazakhstan will be nice, but I am not looking forward to customs.   I am very excited to see you though.

Depending on how long that I will have to be in Kazakhstan, I may try to come home after court and have Alina escorted to Moscow.  Kim (or Kim & I) may travel to Moscow to pick her up after the New Years holiday.  I will be sad if I have to leave her behind for a few more days.  But I might have to accept this arrangement if my work calls me back to Houston.  So many times my schedule changes that it is difficult at work.  I know that you experienced similar difficulties with you flight plans this summer.

I will bring pictures of your visit this summer.  I will also bring warm clothes!

I received an email from a new family that hopes to adopt Zhuldiz.  I am so happy to hear that she has a family.

Hi Sherene,

Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for Chad suggestions.  He is into anything about rocks, Harry Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- baseball.

I'm leaving for Kazakhstan tomorrow, so I didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys.  Chad helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like.  Believe me, you will see the Chad influence when you open the items.   A box is on its way to you.

Have a blessed holiday.

Love 
Shelley

I'm planning on heading out the office around 3 PM or so.  Feel free to send home staff as business needs permit.  I'm not planning on sending out any kind of notice to all Gas Logistics -- as I feel like it is frustrating to those that must stay.

Have a safe and happy holiday.   I'll be in Austin tomorrow & Friday, so call me on my cell (713-857-2103) or email me if you need me.  In case of emergency, I can be reached at my brother-in-law's house in Austin at 512-474-5631.

Jackie,

I got the call to travel to Kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next Thursday, Dec. 13.  I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship.  I think I've misplaced her email address.  If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again.  Thanks and have a blessed holiday.

Shelley

A couple of thoughts

-  Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between Houston-Frankfurt-Alma Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.  We'd only have to take
Transaero one way from Alma ata to Moscow.

- If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).  I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.

- I want to me flexible on travel.  But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot.

 

Liz - Right after I had Kim run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, Chris called me to say that the application will probably need the "sworn and subscribed" language before the notary stamp.   

Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?  Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?  I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.

Here is the missing language

STATE OF TEXAS  
COUNTY OF HARRIS

Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.

My conversation with Chris was quite different than my conversation with Ginger.  While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.  She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at Christmas.

On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.  When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.

You can call me at home tonight if you want to talk.

Kim,

My nonstop direct from Houston cleared for tomorrow (4:40 PM).  The only catch is that I have to go to the airport this afternoon to change my tickets.  My return back from Moscow on the 30th also cleared.   I am still waitlisted for a return flight from Almaty on the 23rd.

Stan is having a 1/2 day staff meeting next Wed.  Dec 12 until lunchtime.   Accordingly, I need to reschedule my staff meeting.
Please let me know about your availability to meet from 1-3 PM on Dec. 12 in my office. 

I haven't received my dossier.

When I asked you to adjust the Gas Logistic's PAA's to $100, I forgot to ask you to do the same on the separate PAA for gift checks for EOTT pipeline control.  Please give me a call if you need any supplemental paperwork from me.

Happy Holidays

Fran,

I need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before I leave town on Thursday.  I was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on ERonline (my wallet was stolen over the weekend and I had to change bank accounts).  I was also able to adjust my EFCU deductions.

I am unable to complete the following changes online and I'm hoping that you can help me work these issues:
- Stop PAC contributions
- Stop Savings Bond automatic purchases
- Stop 2002 United Way deduct.  I had selected to make one time contribution in Feb (around bonus time).  My plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the United Way bill me directly instead.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Attached is a copy of Theresa's mid-yr review

 

Sorry I missed your call last night.  I had a good cry and went to bed early.  
 
As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.  It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).  
 
Here is the other part of my plans.  I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.  I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.  Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.
 
I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January.  That way Kim can return for Alina after the first of the year if necessary.  Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements.  I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with Alina there.  Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.  
 
I am totally terrified about traveling by myself  -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.  I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.
 
I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.  Will the assistance service help me at customs?  Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?  Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?
 
Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz.  I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.

Alma/Lisa,

I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.  What will lose?  What have we not paid back?

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=
on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "=
informal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=
, moved from a "hold" to a "sell" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=
he company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.=20

Enron=20
To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=
.2bn equity charge related to the closing of "related party transactions" w=
ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=
nyone?=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=
f disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlike=
ly to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for sha=
reholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief exe=
cutive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problem=
 goes beyond one individual.=20

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America

Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "W=
ho knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their app=
roach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do."

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=
ow about the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=
ef financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder eq=
uity. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for detai=
ls.=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad=
 news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compa=
ny's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term f=
ortunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=
y's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's l=
owered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow Wednesd=

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it cr=
eate a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoardin=
g it, perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled? Did we wipe o=

 which Enron won it all and shareholders from California utilities lost?=20

termath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department a=

worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time.=20
And we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to t=

We ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treb=

What surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want t=

This nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abando=

If you don't know about the NNG quality posting that's probably a good sign that it hasn't been posted yet.  I'm hoping to have a conversation with Mary Kay tomorrow before its posted. Thanks.  Get back to your kid stuff now!

Bob,

FYI.  The statements about Transco not honoring EOL contracts doesn't make sense to me.  I don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations.    

I had a call from Shawn Amaya from Duke Energy who relayed information that Transco was not honoring any EOL contracts to flow.  He asked if we would post a notice if NNG was not going to flow EOL/ENA gas.  I indicated that we are presently doing business as usual with all our customers.  

Kevin,

Please call ASAP.  While I have been working through the theory on how to make this happen, but I don't know the details on which pipelines and which accounts.

Please change bank accounts for customer payments asap. We will get account numbers for you.

Also tell shelley to notify the customers to send the payments to the new accounts.

I would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with adescription from the reps about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid.  Especially Peoples.  On first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or Peoples.

Jennie,
 
When you get in tomorrow, could you please check whether the direct flight on the 15th cleared.  If not, please advise which flight path I'm currently cleared on.  
 
I don't want to lose the return home through Moscow on the 31st (waitlisted also for 29th or 30th); but I may also need to return immediately after my court date from Almaty on Dec 23 (in such case my husband would fly back to Moscow to pick up our daughter after the 1st of the year).   I would like to make such a reservation is possible.
 
I think you can probably let all the other waitlisted items go for me.
 
Please call me when you get a chance.

I'll have someone pull the volumes in the morning if its not too late.  Sorry but my messages didn't come across my blackberry when I was in Austin Fri & Sat.

Do you have volumes by contract type somewhere?

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

<<TW Rev By K Date.XLS>> 

Do you know where I might be able to get this kind of information? 

Tracy:  I need your help.    They don't quite understand the business but we need to be able to break the variouss vol;umes aprt to be able to get this moving.

Jan if you are here today can I get you to help me out with some info.  The most important thing I need is actual volumetric data going back and projected as far out as you have it.    You can see the splits between the gallup volumes, red rock and the pre existing deals.   I also need to verify the capacity added from the expansions.   Also need to begin to detail the volumes from Long term firm contract versus short term deals including IT etc.

Rod, 

Following our conversations today it appears necessary to include more granular information in the transwestern model.  We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. 

This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for "reverse synergies."  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.

I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  

Please let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  

Jayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.   

Thank you,

Perhaps this can help with the non-Red Rock piece.  This spreadsheet takes current rates and multiples out against MDQ for 2002.   It also show billing units through 2005.  I have reconciled this schedule with Jan Moore and Lindy Donoho

Thanks.  If you could have Richard add the volumes in as columns into this schedule format that would be great.  Rod needs this ASAP.

Are you available to come by for a few minutes before staff meeting?  I need to talk to you about a new round of due diligence and a conference call this afternoon.

Esther is out of the office today and Elizabeth is out all week.  Please pass all data requests through Richard and me.  Richard will be able to pull the commodity volume request below.

Rick

Good morning all.

Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday. Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.  Help?  Can someone pull this together quickly for me?

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.

 << File: TW Rev By K Date.XLS >> 

Thanks for your note!  I guess you're living proof that one can successfully make it through the twists and turns of international adoption.

I hear you're leaving Wednesday for Kazakhstan (sp).  good luck.  It will all work out great.  I'll be thinking about you and praying for you and your new little girl.  What a bright light in the midst of all this yuck.  Send me a picture if you get a chance.  I'm very excited for you.  Dari

Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.  This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.
 
 
 

Kevin,

Per my phonemail message, attached is a summary of Oct 2000-Sept 2001 Transwestern transportation & storage revenues by counterparty.

Thanks.  Don't know how that happened.  I'll call you when I get downstairs tomorrow am.

Publish away!

Do you have any problem with my paper being published in the "Oil & Gas Journal"?

You had previously approved this for publication.  They would like to know by tomorrow.

Here it is again:

CAn you help her?

Rod,
 
Do you know how to get in touch with Paul Cherry or Dan Fancler over the weekend?
I have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for TW for the bankruptcy lawyers -- including contract lists and receivables.  I need to have someone run a payables list.
 
I can be reach via blackberry or on cell 713-857-2103
 

Both Kim's parents & my mom will be at the house on Christmas eve/Christmas day -- so I think they'll eat their Christmas meal at our house.  I'm sure that Kim, Chad, Mom and Nevin would appreciate a Christmas evening dessert invite.  You can coordinate when you see them for Mexican food on Sat. night.

Have fun at the violin concert.

Hi. Just checking into see how you are doing. As you know, other than
putting up lights and wrapping gifts, I am here to assist (shopping, baking,
card playing, Lego building, dog or cat sitting, Mother entertainment). Do
you think your clan would like to come over for Christmas dinner or at least
in the evening for some dessert? ( I realize you are probably not focused on
food now, but...)
I ordered the phrase book and John, Brianna, and I will start studying.
Tonight, we are going to Miss B's Christmas violin concert!

Take care,
CJB

I know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.  Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?  

- When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence
- When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters
- And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.

I wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family.

The attached letter is being sent out to NNG's customers to assure them that business continues under  ordinary course of business.  We thought it would be helpful for your information as well.  This letter is also being posted on NNG's website.  

 << File: customerletter.doc >> 

Thanks for your leadership on this issue.  The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.  I'm glad you are involved!

I will be traveling out of the country next week.  Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.

Happy Holidays
Shelley

I don't understand why the schedule show no variance for Gas Logistics.  My workpapers indicate that we should be down by $300K or so

Thanks, Ricki

That must be frustrating.  I've asked HR to address this problem.

Upon entering names and ALL the other info we are suppose to enter on submitting names for our evaluations I got a message saying "no records found matching your criteria". I tried a couple of names and got the same msg. Therefore I cannot start this process.

I'm in my office now

Upon repressurizing the Station 13 yard piping it was discovered that the new side valve installed has a leak.  We have instructed the team to go ahead and try to resolve/fix this problem now.  The market continues to underburn and we will have no problems today making all deliveries while they continue to work at station 13.

The bad news is that if they can not resolve this valve problem today, then there is a strong possibility that we will have to do this outage again.

Gary Smith asked me to come by his office before noon.  I am in gas control now -- I stopped by your office with Connor.

The Phase V team has completed their work at Station 13.  Currently the operations crew at Station 13 is purging and packing the 30" mainline at Station 13 to the first valve section.  They are about one hour from completion.  We will return our mailine valves and horsepower to normal operating status when they are done.

The market only took a 1375 on the 1550 schedule; thus, we were able to keep the market well packed up, and we are in great position for making all deliveries again today.

FP&L only took 700 yesterday and they only want to target 720 today.  They have 783 scheduled today.  They had orginally nominated 850+ with the anticipation that they might lose some gas this weekend.  I think they are happy so far this weekend with our flexibility afforded to them.

I will email you when the line is completely turned back to us at Station 13.

If you are church, please do not respond to this email -- I would not want responisiblity for causing you to stumble into 
the sin of not listening to the sermon.

----Original Message-----
Please give me this mornings update -- as I will be sending out a new status report when I get to the office at noon

Great!

FYI - FPL conducted a "test" wire yesterday and successfully sent a penny to our new Citibank account.  We should not have to worry about half of FGT's cash coming in today...

Is this cash coming into TW?

Rick - Stan has announced that there is a hiring freeze in effect.  We will not be permitted to fill this position without making a special appeal to Stan.  Couple this with the fact that I need to present to Danny/Stan a proposal on how we can trim our 2002 O&M and I'm not inclined to make such a pick.   Lets talk about how we can redeploy our current resources to cover....I especially want to talk about how we pick use the accounting coordinators in an expanded role.
 
 
 
 
FYI -
 
Pat Steele was offered (and accepted) a job from NBPL to schedule gas in Omaha.  Her first day in their group will be December 17th.  
 
Unlike the situation with Michelle Cormier, in which my group absorbed the work associated with her vacancy, I will seek to obtain approval to replace Pat's position.

Yes, please assure Galen of his need to recuperate.  Will you send him a fruit basket from the group.  How are you coming at getting Debbie Thompson or Blair or Larry Berger lined up? 

Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.  

Rick

I would like these individuals to have a training with Teb Lokey today or tomorrow.    Teb is aware of my desire in this regard and is awaiting your call to set up the time.

Shelley,  FYI--Rick & I have discussed how we will cover the reservation billing scheduled for Saturday.  Marion & Cynthia will assist us in the coverage as well as Jerry Skirtich who sat  with Galen & I on Tuesday to cover the ncessary steps to generate the billing process.  Galen has a "desk procedure manual" assembled that spells out in detail the billing process.  I'm working w/Larry Hill to ensure the Capacity Release transactions are fed to the old TSS system (still testing this process.)  I've expressed a great sense of urgency surrounding the invoicing process given the cash flow concerns we're dealing with.  Sheila

Thanks Gary.  This is an excellent plan.

Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  

1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities
	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.

	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South
	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. 

	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and
	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.

	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation
	Center (EB42C1). 

2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone 
	
	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. 
	
On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics
business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, 
and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to
support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks, depending on events.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary

My thought is that the Enron contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for Jan 1.  I think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account.  

I finally got a price quote of $1990 per year on a package deal for one user.  Platts doesn't sell the data without a subsciption to the daily publication. The package includes the daily issues and data(table) and back issues and data. 

Please let me know if you want me to go ahead and sign up for this package. I'll have to let Platts know the user's name and billing information etc...

Thanks.

Either Galen or Jim Studebaker.  I'll check with Sheila.  

I'll go ahead and sign up. I just left a message for my contact at Platts to get information on the registration process.  Do you think Galen Coon should be the designeated user since he handles the weekly postings and accounting of imbalance invoices?

Your prayers and concerns are much appreciated!  

I have been meaning to call you, but have been swamped with bid week. I just
wanted to check on you and make sure you are ok. You and your family are in
our prayers and if there is anything at all I can you for you, please call.

Have a very blessed day.

 You are welcome.  What a neat idea - electronic thank you cards.

Kevin,

Per my phonemail message, attached is a summary of Oct 2000-Sept 2001 Transwestern transportation & storage revenues by counterparty.

Oh my perhaps I've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of Chad's rock collection.  It consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum.  He would love anything about rocks.

Thank you for your thoughts.  I am fine.   Our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally.  While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many Enron employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area.  It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there!

Shelley-

Just to let you know I am thinking if you.  Please let me know how you are
doing.  Take care.

Ellie

Ditto back at you.  Sounds like things have been crazy at Halliburton this week.

Shelley-

Just to let you know I am thinking if you.  Please let me know how you are
doing.  Take care.

Ellie

I know you were being nice and I am sorry.

I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  

I shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.  

The heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.

My physical was ok.  Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.  So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics. 

Am I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?

Q,

I'm sorry about this morning.  I really was trying to be nice by making some
coffee and turning up the heat so it would be easier for you to get out of
bed.  How was your physical?  Did they give you an antibiotic?  Let me know.

Love Kim

Looks good

Please add Lou Moore to my contact list

Thanks for the information.  Do you happen to have an email address for Elza?

Shelley;
Sorry to hear of all the Enron problems topped off by your bus experience
on Friday. It was obviously a professional who preys on victims every day.
I assume you are going to Kazakhstan on Thursday, probaly arriving in
Almaty late Friday night. I hope your flight goes direct from Frankfurt or
Amsterdam direct to Almaty. It saves a little hassle if you avoid Moscow,
unless you plan to do some touring before going on to Kazakhstan.
I have been to Almaty two times. It is a beautiful city surrounded by snow
capped mountains. If you have a vivid imagination you can see China just
across the mountains.
You can contact the following folks who can help you if you get stuck. Elza
Utegenova spent a semester with us last year. She teaches at The Kazak
State Agrarian University. She speaks excellent English and is a wonderful
person. She does not have a car or telephone. She could help arrange city
travel. You should make arrangements before you depart, unless you are
taking a lap-top with you.
You could also contact Daulet Chunkunov, country director for WINROCK
INTERNATIONAL in Kazakhstan. He has been to Pennsylvania
and we have visited with him on both of our trips to Almaty. He speaks good
English, has a car, email, and telephones. His email is
dc@winrock.lorton.com. Cell phone 8 333 210 8320. Other phone 3272
63-05-56. Fax(3272)63-15-55.
I am completing this after talking with you by telephone.
Good luck and keep in touch,
Lou 

Thank you for your kind note.  Frankly with all the challenges our leadership team has faced this year, I don't have the slightest qualm that you and the other directors will  handle anything that comes our way.

Shelley,
 
I want you to know how happy I am for you being able to finally go to Kazakhstan and complete the adoption of your  daughter.  
 
While you are gone, please try to think about work and Enron as little as possible.  We will put in extra effort to ensure things go smoothly while you are out.  I will copy you on any important emails and data requests to give you something to read through when you get back to Houston.  
 
Enjoy your first new days of traveling with Aliana (sp).  I'm sure you both will be somewhat apprehensive about the travel arrangements and she will be looking towards you to see if she should be frightened.  On Sunday, I asked my Sunday school class to pray for your safety, for uncomplicated travel, and for patience while wading through the governmental red tape.  My family and I will be thinking about you and your family over the holidays.
 
Rick

I had Kim run down to my office to sign the revised letter and so I can fedex tonight.

I am so bummed about Jan. travel date and not having Alina for Christmas. Is this for sure? Was she speaking just about me or was she saying Jan 1 for you too?   Why Jan 1?  If there holidays are Dec 30-Jan 1, then why shouldn't we set out to travel around then, so we could have our court date the first days after their holidays?

Sorry for all the venting!

Shelley,
Chris called while I was gone. She told my mother in law that it looked like 
the first of January for travel. She also said if you had already done the 
letter, to cross out and initial the change. I called her back and left a 
message saying that if it is indeed the first of January, then you will have 
time to redo the letter, and not Fed-ex it today. I will let you know when I 
hear back from her or Ginger.
Let me know you got this email please.

Liz

Almost 100% certain that its just me.  I'd rather have good flights and spend the money on just me (i.e. we can share hotel costs).  

Shelley,
I also found out that Luth. did fly out of Houston. They were sold out on the 
10th and only had 3 seats on the 11th.  I will do more looking when we know 
for sure the dates. If the prices are really high, then Fred may stay home, 
and I will go. Is it looking like just you, are is Kim going also?

Liz

Just got home from work ... but that is funny, cause I'm still working -- now at home.  Guess you've probably heard about events at my company.
 
If you couldn't see the red -- the editorial notes were also in parentheticals
 
You dickens -- you were only supposed to get Chad 1 item from the list.  Then I pass it on to Tracey, Pat, Arliene etc.

Didn't see an editorial notes in red but I did really enjoy the article.  
Thanks for sending it to me. 

I'll send you this e-mail but I may talk with you tonight.  I'll try in a 
while. 

We went to Sam's Club tonight and later, we went to the Mall to look for 
"Chad stuff."  Got the Backyard Football Game...hope I got the right one.  It 
says "Back-yard Football 2002 NFL.  Win/Mac CD-ROM ...was $19.99.  Also found 
a Harry Potter item at B. Dalton bookstore.  Not sure if this is one of the 
things on the list.  I bought the Harry Potter Trading Card Game (Two-Player 
Starter Set)..it was $12.00.  The Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows) 
comes out 11/16.  I'll get it when it comes out.  But, tell me if the other 
items are O.K. 

Love, 
Mom 

Yes can do.

Are you available to go to lunch with Steve Hotte, Lisa Sawyer and me tomorrow?  Topic would be the Rates and Revenue project and CMS project.  

Brad

I know that the long term solution rests with Charlie Thompson.  But, Caroline, I'm frankly shocked at GMS seeming lack of concern for the seriousness of this situation.  I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.  When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.  

I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.  No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility -- its always someone elses fault -- the field didn't get the info in in time, the OMV wasn't received, the system doesn't work....What is the level of service that GMS is accountable for.  Please understand that this criticism is not directed to you.  I'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 21st century with the rest of us -- befort Dave Neubauer raises his frustrations to the highest levels of ETS.
 

Shelley, I would like to see Charlie Thompson or a representative from operations at this meeting since a major issue which will have to be addressed is the physical measurement equipment on NNG's pipe. GMS has not had much success in getting measurement equipment upgrades out of operations.  Customer issues may be the justification needed for the upgrades.  I will also plan on being there along with Gary.   cvb

Shelley:

	Unfortunately I will be on vacation on November 26th.  However, Gary will be attending and is well versed and postured to speak to 16 and 31 day charted PD measurement.  Gary has been working behind the scenes with your group, the field, marketing and technology to resolve the problems associated with equipment not suited for providing adequate daily information.  At the same time he has been working on gaining assistance in getting 16 day measurement data into the office on time for processing and review prior to month's end close.   Just as a side note, I understand now that Charlie Thompson of the Measurement Technology Group and Tech Ops has been given the charge to come up with a five year plan for installing automated and adequate equipment accross the board for these situations.

Ellis

Ellis/Gary

I hope that you can both make it to the meeting on Monday to discuss the issue of daily NNG measurement readings.  A number of our NNG customers are protesting DDVC invoices based on our inability to provide daily measurement information.   Alliant is just the latest in the string of customers.   The NNG marketing group is very frustrated on this issue.  

We need to put all our collective talents together.  This issue needs the highest levels of attention possible form measurement.

Reminder, the meeting to discuss the Alliant measurement issue is at 3:30 Monday in 49c2. sj

Will call you at 9 tonight.

Hi Shelley:
Perhaps we can talk tonight about several things I need to coordinate with 
you.
(1)  Children's Church schedule for December.  I talked to Steve Hoyle, and 
he did not have a preference one way or the other about Children's Church for 
the Cantata Sunday.  He did say the music program was rather long, with lots 
of dialogue.  I am inclined to say let's have C/C, and I can commit to being 
there.  Of course, we need at least 2 others to commit as well.  Since it 
would be rather long, I would be in favor of supplementing the C/C service 
with a Christmas-themed video.
(2)  Have you looked into food from McDonald's for the Christmas party?  I am 
working on the invite's, and tentatively am putting down on the RSVP card a 
meal preference of hamburgers or chicken nuggets (check one.)   That way, we 
can go either way with Happy Meals or just the basic food and fries, 
depending on cost, ease of packaging, etc.  Let me know what you think and if 
you need help with looking into this.
(3)  I saw some cute "Happy Birthday, Jesus" themed trinkets in the Oriental 
Trading catalog.  If you think we need more things for the treat bags, this 
is a possibility.  They also had a cute plastic treat bag with this theme 
that was fairly inexpensive.  (I can't remember if you said you already had 
bags or were still going to get them.)
I could talk tonight after 9:00, if that is convenient for you.
Thanks, Shelley!

Peggy,

Your email notice was timely as I was just thinking about you.  I have wanted to congratulate you on your promotion.  I am so happy for you.  I find it validating, especially at this time at Enron, to know that good things do happen to good people.

Give me a call if you can ever break free for lunch.  I would like to catch up with you on business matters, and more importantly, on international adoptions.  I know that you have already navigated these waters and I am looking forward to travel to Kazakhstan to adopt a little girl.

Best wishes to you and your family for the holidays.

Any chance of doing the one penny test with the credit departments of the top couple of customers.

Sorry for the delay.  My wallet and checkbook were stolen on Fr night & I spent all day yesterday getting things in order...after the thief charged $6000 on my credit and debit cards!  Remember that conversation we had about 2001.
 
I did little research on Compuserve and AOL.  Both have acess numbers in Almaty Kazaknstan -- where I'll be at least 1 week of my journey.  Looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $6 connect fee.  So I don't see the advantage of adding AOL -- unless you see something I don't.  Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow.  So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP.  
 
I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan.  But, I'm staying at the Grand Marriott in Moscow.  Surely they have some sort of ISP access.
 
My current ISP is Compuserve.  Mail address:  cormanerb@cs.com <mailto:cormanerb@cs.com>;  User:  cormanerb;  password:  chad4erb.  I currently have version 5.0 loaded -- there is a 6.0 available but I haven't had a chance to download.
 
My Enron password is also chad4erb.
 
I'm at the house (281-531-0385)  if you need any other info.

No thank you for all you and your teammates do.

I would just like to express by thanks and appreciation for the nice surprise yesterday afternoon.  And, thank you for always being professional and encouraging to all of us.

Sherry

I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.  What will lose?  What have we not paid back?

I have heard back from Danny and he wants us to cancel the event.  Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo  any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling.

Shelly,
I am obligated to pay the full $2850 to the Casino company.  I have not actually paid, but per the agreement that is what I would owe.

Alma/Lisa,

I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.  What will lose?  What have we not paid back?

Please provide written notice of postponement and tell them to bill us.

Just got off the phone with the hotel.  If we postpone the event the cancellation fee still applies and fee cannot be used toward future events.  The cancellation fee consists of anticipated revenue, however, the hotel has agreed to gives us a 20% discount.

Anticipated Revenue:
		 Food:		$1,055.00
		 Drinks:	   $800.00
				$1,855.00

$1,855.00 with 20% Off =  $1,484.00
				 296.80   (20% service charge)
			          	 146.92   (8.25% Sales Tax)
                           $1,927.72
				

Please call.  I'm confused about the hotel amount.

Alma - we will hand out the prizes in a raffle on the date of our holiday luncheon on Dec. 11.

Shelley,
According to the contracts below is what we will pay for cancellation.  Payment is due the day of event.
DJ - $100
Hotel -	1,454.88

Alma/Lisa,

I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party.  What will lose?  What have we not paid back?

I'll take care of the programs

I didn't get much of a chance to talk with you on Sunday.  Hope you had a
great Thanksgiving - and got some rest.

Did you get my e-mail with the inside of the program?  Will you be able to
print them up?  If not, just let me know and I can get them done.  Since we
didn't take pictures or get pictures drawn, we could just put "The Case of
the Missing Christmas" on the front wiht a magnifying glass and a manger
scene.

Also, I have found 3 of the angel costumes that we used last year and we'll
have to use something else for the 4th.  I'm making new halos that the
girls can keep if they want to.

Linda

Okay - now I've lost the file.  I guess I deleted the wrong message.  Can you resend?

Donna - lets meet tomorrow AM to translate the bonus/merit info into spreadsheet form

Of interest -
Gas Logistics combined 2001 payroll is $8,209,648.  The 2002 Plans were built with a 4.25% combined merit and other which equates to $348,910.  At 3.75% the combined merit and other equates to $307,862, a reduction of $41,048.  Over the next few days, I will be rebuilding the 2002 revised plan for distribution.

	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
"RIMS" link, select "Docket#" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the "e-Filing" link.

Please send it to both of us.  Given Gary's presentation on bonus timing I plan to turn in my recomendations today.  Can I meet with you at 4:oo?

I am meetin with my direct reports at 1 to work on recommendations. So I need your spreadsheets ASAP

Thanks see you at 4

We found no cross-default provisions in the material contracts.   Moreover, FERC standards of conduct required pipelines to keep contracts, books and records separate from other Enron entities.   

Shelley, I am reviewing the TW and NNG Credit Agreements to determine what was triggered by today's activities - one question that my review raised is whether there are any cross-default provisions in the Material Contracts (as defined in the credit agreements).  Dorothy said that you looked at them and might know the answer - any chance??  Thanks, Kim

Caroline - I think you captured the right projects, but please look at the bottom line on total reductions.  You show $3 Million in savings.  I think that the schedule should reflect over $6 million of reductions from the original cap. budget.

In my mind there is still a question on whether the meter bounce and PNR projects should be included.

Please see attached.  On the Rates & Revenue I have everyone paying up their share of the base.   Cvb

Thanks.  Yes, I forgot to mention how sad I was to learn about Cuba.

SHelley: I feel AWFULLLL!!! What can I do? YOu are just about the best friend I have ever had in my whole life and I feel like I am absolutely falling short on supporting you right now. I am sorry about the wallet snatching - that is incredible --- How in the world could those charges  have occurred so quickly since it is the holidays, I would think that the cashiers are being extra careful. Anyway... I am glad that you are going on the trip; My mom and dad said that they are going to pray for you every day (they go to Mass now everyday at St. Joseph's Villa in Philly) - same with my sisters -- they have all been asking about you. Lunch really was great and was definitely needed by me! I am also sure by now you have heard the news about Cuba --- I am so sad about his passing - my understanding was that the chemo was working on his cancer (which had recurred from last year) but when he was supposed to be discharged, he came ! down with pneumonia and died shortly after. 

I will keep in touch with you via email and if there is ANYTHING I can do --- even wiring funds if you need it while you are travelling, let me know... 

Take care, 

Rosemary 

What a crazy day.  I'm in the waiting room of the ENT now.  I will make meatloaf for dinner when I get home.

Sounds fine

Q,

Cindy told me that they are still in the same class with Chad and don't test
until Thursday.  Therefore, Cindy will pick up Chad tonight and Wednesday if
we decide Chad is going Wednesday,  Based on that, I think I'll run tonight.

See you when you get home.

Love Kim

I thought that you would enjoy reading this article about Chad's school.  My editorial notes are added in red.  Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.

AWESOME VISIT
On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed!
The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!
As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome.
Maggie Strange, Julius Liu, Danny Siso and Brandi Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children. Doris Reese, Joan Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from Chad's class) , and Andrew Nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World.

Thanks.  I went to see Dr.  Shelley Leeds Rickets this am.She is a Baylor grad and is very nice.

Glad you weren't in an accident today.  Have a good trip.

Shelley I need to know how you want to be listed for the next two weeks on the officers itinerary report.  Sharon Solan is needing this info by noon.  Last week you were listed as traveling.

Thank you, Ricki

This sounds fine.

Please have my phone forwarded to Ava and provide her with my contact information.

Shelley, I need to make my vacation plans for the Christmas holidays and I don't know how long you will be away.

Since I did not take any vacation during Thanksgiving, I was planning on leaving Thursday December 20th, returning on Monday January 7th.  Jean will be checking my lap top to make sure my dial-in access is stable so I will be able to keep your in basket clean.  During these dates, I could also have your phone forwarded to Ava if you wish.  We can work out the details later, but I need to purchase my ticket today.  

Since there are many things going on during these uncertain times and you need me here, please feel free to say so,,,, I understand completely.

Thank you, Ricki

I don't this we give our customers lockbox instructions any longer.  Invoices cite wire instructions and physical address.  Raetta please confirm.

Lockbox should still stay bank of america.  I  am working with Treasury to make sure that these accounts stay open for the next 10 days.

Rod,

Attached are revised wire transfer instructions for company 60 and 179

Companies 62 and 370 should remain unchanged

How was your Drivers License experience?  What were they able to do?

Thanks for your kind words.  

Godspeed to you and your family as you make this trip.  My younger child is adopted and it has been a wonderful blessing and experience -- he is about to celebrate his 27th birthday!  

These are difficult days -- all of us may not understand everything that is taking place but we remain committed to diligently performing our jobs.  Have a safe trip!

Alma - can you copy me on the RSVP list for the Thursday party.

Liz - I noticed that Luftansa has flights back on Dec 27 from Moscow.

Using the same itinerary that we discussed before -- but for Dec 11 returning Dec 27 listed fare is $2830.40.

We will continue to schedule transactions with ENA and other Enron affiliates in a business as normal fashion.  If ENA's supply is cut, then deliveries will be adjusted, just as we normally do.  

Bob Superty, Dir of ENA Gas Logistics has asked to be notified of any ENA supply cuts.  I'm not talking about nits and nats that are part of the normal confirmation process, rather, I'm talking about if a confirming party refuses to confirm a block of ENA gas.     We are notifying Bob as a courtesy and nothing about this added notice should hold up routine business processes.

You can leave Bob a voice message at x 3-0957 or call me and I'll call Bob.  In any event, I also would like to be briefed about any significant cuts in ENA or other Enron affiliate supply.

 

I'll be on the call for the first 1/2 hour.  Theresa will be on for the who=
le call.  We can re-group to talk about comments after the call.

Shelley, I was going to call you regarding this Partial Day Recall NOPR.  I=
 spoke with Anna Cochrane today, and she said that in terms of INGAA's plan=
s for answering the NOPR, the GISB pipeline group already has mobilized to =
work on INGAA positions (the GISB folks got together on their own, accordin=
g to Anna).  Since this is a GISB issue, can I assume you are in this loop?=
  Also, for Enron we should discuss how to develop comments, between your f=
olks and Joe's group.

Thanks,
Nancy

Chris,

I never heard back from you after I sent the fax yesterday.  I am anxious about correctly signing and notarizing the INS forms and would like to discuss when you have a minute.

Gina,

Did you ever prepare a set of talking points on the separateness of the pipelines from Enron.

 
I know you are swamped with other matters, so I jotted down in memo form my travel plans.  I guess it's Murphy's Law that I got the phone call that I need to travel now in the midst of current work events.

 

Catherine,

I have received the call and will be traveling to Kazakhstan next week to complete the adoption.  My husband and son are staying back.  I arrive in Almaty on the 14th late in the evening.   I'll spend the day of the 15th in Almaty and then take the overnight train to Taraz.  I expect to have a court date in Taraz on the 19th or 20th.  Then I will be back in Almaty, probably over Christmas.  Finally, I expect to travel to Moscow on around Dec 27 and then return to Houston around Dec 30.  This of course is the plan if everything goes exactly on schedule -- which it probably won't.

I will certainly miss being away from home at Christmas and am hoping to find a Christmas worship service in Almaty.   I'd appreciate any advice in this regard.

I would also appreciate advice on what time of clothes are appropriate to bring.

Thanks

Hi Cindy,

I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb.  (unsual bonus time).  Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.  I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.   ????

Ava,

Could you please generate an envelope to Across the World Adoptions.  Thanks

When I called Ginger's house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at Chris' house -- so I guess that means Chris has returned.  If your process estimates are in line, our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of November date.  I am very concerned that we will slip to Christmas time travel.

While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at Ginger or Chris this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing.

Shelley,
I'm sure she already thinks I'm difficult. I'm pretty sure the Kaz government 
sets the court date after your dossier is registered  there. So, if our 
paperwork is not there yet, then how can she know that our court date will be 
in the time frame she thinks it is?
The more I try to understand everything she had told me the more confused I 
get sometimes. It's really hard not understanding and being in on everything 
involved in the process.
I don't know if she even knows how long the paper work will take. Chris told 
me, when I sent mine in 5 weeks ago, that the estimate was 2 weeks for 
translation, 2 weeks for the Kaz embassy, 2 weeks to be sent to Kaz and 
registered. As of Monday mine is still in translation.
I really don't know what to do right now. Should we just wait until the first 
of next week and call again and find out the status of everything?

Liz

Jennie - This looks okay if I wait for my husband or Liz to go on the 20th -- although I think the return would need to be extended a  day or so.
 
Could you also see about if I am traveling alone and wanted to change my ticket to leave Sat.  I was searching the Internet and it looks like the Lufthansa flight is still available on Sat.
 
I need to make some quick decisions about what I'm doing tomorrow.
 
 
 

this is the closest dates I can find the nonstop Houston flight that will still accept a waitlist so I booked this one also..........jennie

La Griglia at West Gray at 12:00 - can't wait! 

Rosemary 

Jennie,

I made it home last night, but have been unsuccessful in resolving Kim & Alina's travel arrangements.  I have only been able to get the answering machine at your office this morning.

I need to get Kim & Alina on flights home on Wed. Jan 9.  My current thinking is that it may be better to take a refund on the Lufthansa return tickets (since the Moscow Lufthansa office doesn't want to reissue) and to instead prepay tickets home for them on a flight path that only requires one change ?

Please advise

Terrific.  I called to let Kim know.  They will be leaving in just a few hours.  One last item.  Can you make them a reservation on this flight.  Kim will purchase the tickets at the Dallas Airport.

I sent it to her

Hi.  I'm here -- just barely though -- my sinus infection is back.  Can we get together in my office (the less elevator riding the better) sometime between 11-1?  I'm planning to be out of office tomorrow.

Shelley:
Welcome back! I was wondering if you had 30 minutes today to discuss NNG's major customers from a strategic perspective.  Stan has asked me (on a very confidential basis) to explore various "buy back" options for NNG, including raising a lot of money!  I wanted to get your thoughts on certain customers' willingness to participate in an ownership interest in NNG.  I did not want to meet with Dave and his team given the Dynegy transition. I am free all morning except at 9 and this afternoon except from 2 to 4.

See you then 4262

How about 11?

Here is my draft written review.  Take a look at it and we'll sit down when you have a chance.

Keep up the great work.  I know things have been really stressful for you lately.  It was terrific to have you to rely on when I was away (and when I'm here too!)

 

Here is my written review.  Let me know when you want to sit down and talk.

 

Tonya,

Haven't heard from you in awhile and I am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity.  All of my paperwork (including INS approval) is turned into Ginger and I am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to Kazakhstan.  Ginger and crew are so busy that I imagine that things won't happen very fast.  

Not try to bother you if you had enough of this Kidsave stuff -- but on the other hand --- you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and I just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts.

Shelley

Donna,

Here is the draft written performance review that I prepared while I was traveling.  I would be happy to sit down and discuss with you in person at your convenience.

 

Does Fri at 10 work for you?  I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.

Next week sounds fine for vacation.

I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan. But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.  The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number.

Playdate sounds great

Talk to you tomorrow.

Yes please explain that 8 need Dr signature so she can start preschool Tues.  Besides Fri and Mon afternoons I don't have any other planned time off

I'll be in this afternoon and will give you a call

Great

 Donna,  

Attached is the written comments that I prepared while I was traveling.  I can't remember if I already sent this to you or not ...please forgive me if I already sent this to you (sinus congestion is not conducive to sound thinking).  Let me know when you want to sit down and talk.

 

Brad,

Attached are the written comments that I prepared while I was traveling.  Let me know when you would like to sit down and talk both about 2001 and directions for 2002.

 

I'm fine with giving him these charts and also the job description write ups from the website.  

Shelley-

Attached are the org charts with no cost centers.  Should I forward these to Donnie Brown?

Thanks,
Fran

 << File: ETS GAS LOGISTICS.ppt >> 

	Fran, Donnie Brown with Dynegy would like Shelley's Org Chart showing
	all the people that report to her Direct Reports.  The only one I had 
	had cost center numbers on it and I wasn't sure we wanted to hand that
	out.  

	Could you please get us an Org Chart we can give to Dynegy.  
	He would like for us to email it to him at dbdj@dynegy.com.

	Since I will be out of the office tomorrow, Shelley, please let
	Fran know if you have any concerns with sending this information
	to him.

	His reason for asking for it was to get a better feel for how the groups
	looked.  If you have some questions, you can talk with Steve, since
	he was in the meeting.

	Thanks. Lynn
	

Barbara,

Received your message.  I can't promise that I will attend, as things are pretty much ad hoc at my household at this time while I try to establish some new routines.  I'll try.

See you Sunday.

Hi Everyone:
It has been a crazy first week back after the holidays, and I failed to get a 
meeting notice sent out.  Nonetheless, we will have our last meeting of the 
2001 Children's Ministry Team on Monday, January 14, at 7:30 in the 
Fellowship Hall.  This will be an informal hour-long meeting at which we will 
celebrate and review the past year as well as share dreams for the future.  
We also will have something good to eat, i.e. a low-fat (maybe) dessert!  I 
hope everyone will be able to make it.  
Happy New Year!
Barbara Thompson
281-493-3035
P.S.  Please reply to let me know you received this message, and I would 
appreciate knowing that you are planning to attend.  Thanks!

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=

Saturday was great.  Yesterday was not a banner day for me.  I just kept having feelings of remorse and then guilt that I was feeling remorse.  You're probably the only person that can understand how I'm feeling.  Talk to you tonight.  If you and Chad are gone to Karate before we get home -- we'll go to the store and have dinner ready.

Q,

I've confirmed that all four of us are covered under the TSF health plan as
of 1/1/02.  Furthermore, inoculations are covered 100%, so you should only
pay the $10.00 co-pay.

Hi Nancy

I have Alina at the Dr for her physical this afternoon, but we should be home by 6 PM and be home all evening.  Sorry I missed choir last night .  We are still transitioning and Alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir.  

See you soon
Shelley

Ha Ha - We have no busy schedule.  We are just trying to do exciting things like making it to work each day.  Feb. 9 is fine.
Of course you have so kindly showered Alina with gifts that she isn't in need of much.

Will Saturday, Feb. 9th work for your and Alina's busy schedule? 

C.Baily

Please touch base with Gina and let her handle this.

Well, we get all kinds!

Where is the pipeline? Is it above ground where I could photograph it?

I guess we'll cancel the direct report meeting since this means that Lynn, Steve & Mike will be absent.

Shelley, there is a meeting to discuss the SLA meeting today from 9:30 until 11:00 with Lynn, Steve, Mary Kay & Dave Neubauer.  Will you be attending or do you want to continue with your direct report staff meeting?

Thank you, Ricki

Sorry Teb but I have an appointment with the Sinus Dr.  Can we visit in advance of your meeting?

Yes - please reschedule for Tues.  Thanks

Shelley would you like for me to send out a message moving your staff meeting this Monday (1/21) because it's a holiday to 11:00 on Tuesday (1/22).  It's moved on your calendar and the conference room has been booked since we moved to 42.

Thanks, Ricki

How about 2:30?  I'll come to you if that time is okay.  

How about tomorrow sometime?

Sorry Teb but I have an appointment with the Sinus Dr.  Can we visit in advance of your meeting?

I was afraid she'd think I was being difficult if I mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe, not to mention my concerns about missing Chad's Christmas events in December and our nanny holiday issue.
My gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to Kazakhstan.  Because frankly telling us that we can travel 10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been turned in sufficient time.

Shelley,
No, she didn't, and I was too upset about the late November time frame to 
ask. I was thinking about emailing her and asking her when the documents 
would be sent and about how long before we have a court date. I didn't even 
confirm that the 15th was a set date for the other group, but I assume it is. 
If we leave a week or so after them, that puts us leaving right at 
Thanksgiving, which means higher airfare etc...
Should one of us email her or call her and ask?

Liz

Hi.  Thanks for the info.

Hi Shelley - Welcome home!  I hear you are feeling somewhat better.  Can't wait to see you again.  Rob said to forward this to you.

Hi.

Sorry we missed rehearsal Sunday, but we are definitely still "transitioning." 

We will be out of town on Sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing.  We will be at choir practice Sunday evening.

I'll look for March and April songs for the Cherubs.

The videotape of the Christmas program is cute.  Maybe we can find a time to watch it.

Hello, Ladies.

I will not be at choir rehearsal on Sunday.  Nancy has the music we will be
working on and will lead the rehearsal.

We sing at both services Sunday morning.  We are singing "We are the Light"
which we sang in September.   The choirs will sing together.   I will be at
both services.

Rehearsal went well on Sunday, but we were missing quite a few kids.  We
rehearsed "We are the Light".  They know it.   We rehearsed a song that
Nancy picked out for February - "Here is the Church".  I can't remember if
that's actually the name of it.    It is such a nice song, I think the
choirs should sing it together.  At one point, it goes . . . Here is the
church, here is the steeple, open the doors and see all the people.  There
are motions that go with that.    I think it would be cute if the Cherubs
sing that part alone and do the motions alone, at least the first time we
sing it in the song.

March is Palm Sunday.  Let's look for a cute song for the Cherubs to sing.
I think we'll re-use last year's song for the Sonshine Singers.

We need a song for April for each choir.   Steve mentioned he had a song
that he really liked, but I haven't seen it and don't know what type of
song it is.  We can take a look and see what we think.    We can look in
our books and find something for the Cherubs.

We started working on a song in the spring program that is to the tune of
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game."   We didn't get very far on it.  There are
a lot of songs to learn, and I'm shooting to have tapes ready by Sunday so
they can start listening to it.

I'm attaching a schedule.  The program date hasn't been confirmed.   I know
the confirmation class's mystery trip is that weekend.  I don't know
whether that will interfere or not.

(See attached file: Choir Schedule - Spring 2002.doc)

I've got three 4:00 - 6:00 rehearsals planned, but we may not need them.

Linda

My meeting with Rod is next Wed.

Shelley, have you scheduled the meeting with Rod to discuss some measurement issues?  Raetta & Jodie are asking and I suppose they are preparing materials for you.  They must need a timeframe.  Let me know and I will put this on your calendar and advise them.

Thank you, Ricki

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

Did ETS officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment?  Any computers or just flat screens?

    Shelley,

         I was shut-out of the click-at-home program before I got a P.C. ordered and was wondering what the status, is on some of the surplus
computer equipment that is still in the building. I am guessing that there is some left of the same quality or better, than that offered in the
program. Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale. Because it was my idea you could give me mine for free  Ha!

                                                                                                                                                   Thanks Ron Spain

Sorry I'm so slow in getting back with you on your suggestion.  Nothing moves fast in the world of bankruptcy.  Before I left to go out of the country we had put together a proposal to the bankruptcy court to buy computers -- per Donna's note below the bankruptcy court hasn't acted on it yet.  I'll let you know if I hear of any opportunity for employees to buy computers.

Shelley

Shelley,
Laptops and computers are not an option at this time.  The bankrupcy committee has not released them to sell due to their contents.  To date, we have only been able to secure flat screens.  We are still waiting to hear if employees can purchase flat screens, I assume you are still interested.  The committee has pushed the hardware liquidation topic back to the end of January.  We'll keep you posted.

Ok I'm thru with appointment and am on my way in

Thanks again for the kind gift of beanie babies for the orphanage children.  Your kindness is memorialized in my journal.  If you are interested, I have in my office pictures of the kids with their beanies.

Please send me an email with your travel dates -- as I need to make some appointments and plans and I don't want to book while you are going to be gone.

Thanks

Tuesday will be fine

Shelley, 

Sheila Nacey called me today and gave me the details of your request for ENA data.  I have an appointment this afternoon and will be taking a half day of vacation - do you need for me to stay and finish this for you?  Otherwise, I will finish on Tuesday.  Please let me know.  nb

I will be about 15 minutes late

Yes I am here actually I'm on a conference call.  I'll email later tonight.  Kim will be out of the country on Feb 9.  I'm hoping I can bring Alina and make a play date for Chad

We are headed to Austin tomorrow.

We'll be back Sun.  Can you meet at T and C on Sun afternoon Chad would like to go to Zainy Brainy and I need to exchange some things at Gymboree

I forgot to send the address list before we left for Austin.  I'll give it to you tomorrow.

Alina, Chad and I will meet you and Miss B tomorrow at 1:30 at T and C Starbucks.  Then we can go to Zainy Brainy.  How long can you guys shop?  I have some gift certificates for Ann T, Gap and Gymboree.

What is the shower at Patsy's for? When do you have to be there?

Kim has to travel to Indonesia on business Feb 8 to Feb 19.

I already had Donna prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations.  It is rough still -- but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron?s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron?s Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron?s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron?s remaining management team to direct the company?s ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world?s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Sorry I missed your call last week.  Kim misplaced your email address so I'm taking a stab that this is it.

I'd love to talk to you about your upcoming adventure to Kazakhstan.    Do you know where in Kazakhstan you'll be adopting from?

Happy New Year

Shelley

Please remind me of who you plan to have stay in the TW/FGT world to cover SCADA?

Please pick one up at lunch.

Q,

What does it look like for you?  Can you leave early enough today to pick up
a sleeping bag?  If not, I need to know as I would like to pick it up at
lunch.

Love

Kim

Did Ginger give you any read on how long to translate our documents or when they might be sent to Kazakhstan?

Shelley

Hi Shelley,

Thanks for your message.  The best way to reach me is really at work (this
address), but I do check the home account a few times a week.

Anyway, how are you?  It must be wierd seeing your own company in the news
everyday.  Kim said that you were in a good spot to rebound if you needed
to when the dust settles.  That is a relief to us.

As far as the adoption stuff......we still have a long way to go.  Our home
study is being written up this week; we've finished the interviews and have
all of our documents into the social worker.  We are hopefully going to get
notification from the INS to get our fingerprints done within the next week
or so.  We're hoping the INS stuff goes quickly, because that is really the
only major thing we have left to get done.

We don't know where in Kazakhstan we're gonna go yet, but, we are about a
month from getting our name on the referral list; we'll probably find out
possible locations then.  I don't know how much Kim relayed to you, but
we're hoping for a healthy infant, and the rest doesn't matter as far as
preferences.  We are pretty excited already.

How is Alina? (spelling?)  Kim's description of her sounds wonderful.  You
guys must be having a terrific time getting to know each other again after
a few months separation.

Lets definitely stay in touch.  Maybe the next time you come through DC we
can have you over or meet somewhere.

Anyway, say hi to everyone for us.

Love,

Kurt

Thanks.  Please send a note to the gas controllers that we will be having a staff meeting

Shelley, Mike and I have talked it over, and we agree that it makes sense to leave the Gas Control meeting scheduled as is, at 6:00 am on Wednesday. thanks. sj

Hi Mrs. Traylor,

Obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get Alina ("Chad's new adopted sister) settled into our routines.  We have been trying to keep Chad's routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time.  While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests.  This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student.

Do you have any suggestions to help Chad with timed practice tests?  Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks?  If you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about Chad's progress, I could come to school anytime this Friday, February 1 for a conference.

Thanks

Patty, Stephanie & Barbara,

I have samples of Group's VBS curriculum and Children's Church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think.

Group's VBS this year is called Bug Safari (think "Bug's Life").  The bible lessons are about David and play on theme of little in size, big in spirit.  The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk -- so we could reuse the adorable costume Ann Turney made.  I would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon (which I would like to do in late Feb or early March).   I would also like to agree on the date in mid-late July for VBS.  I think I currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar.

I also have ordered samples of Group's Children's Church curriculum.  I have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers.  Most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping -- but not preparing -- a children's church worship.  

Evening meetings are difficult for me right now -- as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.  I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.  (Kim will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri. Feb 1 or Fri. Feb 8  - if either of those days suit.

Thanks for your kind words.  I also wanted to thank you for your flexibility in covering both the gas control desks and the measurement desk.

In my office instead of 42c2.  Thanks

Please make note that Shelley would like to start her staff meeting at 9:30 this morning instead of 9:00.

Thank you, Ricki

Yes.  Please add Tami Head, Barbara Bakanic & Maggie Van Syckle if its not too many.

The offer is still open for you and Linda to host at my house if you would like.

Here is Gaby's address:
Gaby Paniagua
13014 Leader #937
Houston, TX 77072

Hi Shelley:
I am getting out invitations for the shower today.  I am sending one to you 
and Alina so you can see it.  Here is the guest list so far:
Giok Boothe
Lisa Corder
Linda Corredor (co-hosting)
Jacque Daughtry
Sydney Free Duvall
Peggy Erwin
Nancy Ginsburg
Dawn Goddin
Ange Grout
Wendy Houghton
Barbara Howard
Stephanie Keesling
Carla McGinley
Kathy Mynarcik
Becky O'Reilly
Dorothy Pledger
Letha Russell
Pam Thyssen
Ann Turney
Patty Wehn-Glowski

I do need to clarify the following:
1)    Did you say yes to inviting Tami Head?  (My notes aren't clear.)
2)    You listed Cherie Otto on your list.  I know that she and Barbara 
Bakanic are very close friends.  Barbara is also in our S/S class when she is 
not teaching.  Do you think we should invite both of them?
3)    You were going to get me Gabby's (sp?) address.
4)    I thought of Maggie Van Syckle.  Are you close with her?

If there's any one else you think of, just let me know.
Thanks,
Barbara

Okay

Please note there will be a meeting at 3:00 today in Danny's office regarding the floor plan.  We hope that everyone can accommodate their schedules to attend the meeting.  

If you have any questions, please call Julie at x33597.  Thanks.

Hi There. So glad you are back.  How was skiing?  Hope we can get together on Sat. or Sun.

I never know the polite way to suggest gifts.  Perhaps just a gift ideas list?

Summer clothes (Size 4T pants/5T shirts) 
Swimming accessories
Loving Family Dollhouse Furniture & Accessories
Gift certificates

* In lieu of gifts, contributions can be made in Alina's honor to Kidsave International

Hi! The invites are nearly ready to go. I just need the map to Rosemary's
home. 

Also, Shelley -- we discussed that you may want to direct people to certain
things or places for gifts (e.g., books). Let me know what you the invite to
say and, if clothes are still an option, remind me what sizes.

Thanks!
C.Baily

Tomorrow is fine

Sorry I missed you today.

Looking forward to lunch tomorrow.  Will 11:45 at La Grilia suit you?

Have fun at your event tonight.

Also - mea culpa.  I just replaced my daytimer calendar for 2002 and realized that I missed Matt's birthday.  I hope that wasn't the day we were all over at your house.  Oops.  Wish Matt a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion.

See you tomorrow.

See you at 4 Pm 

Shelley:

  Yes, we can!!  My Bible Study starts at 5pm. I have an hour!  We may change 
the Bible Study to an earlier time though due to the Super Bowl and then I 
will have more than an hour. Either way...I know I will be there.  Please 
know I am praying for you for strength and perseverance as you contine to be 
with Enron. I am sure things are not really comfortable right now but I sure 
am glad they have a wonderful light of Christ's witness like you to be among 
all the darkness.  My heart is still mourning the gentleman who ended his 
life. I pray there will be no one else. Alina grows in leaps and bounds each 
day. I see her at ACEC and she is pure delight. She yells a greeting to me 
when she sees me and it lights up my heart.  I am not sure what she is saying 
but we know each other and it really thrills me to see her smile and her 
little hand waving.  She is such a blessing!  Everyone shows her so much 
love. At Sunday school last week we all really gave Chad encouragment and 
affirmation that he is now the big brother.  He seemed pleased and a wee bit 
shy about all the attention.  Hope and pray we were not toooo much for him.  
Shelly, if you ever get stuck for someone to keep the kids for a while...I 
would be honored if my schedule permits.  Just wanted you to know! 
Thanks for all you do and are doing! I can't wait to begin beating the drum 
for VBS.
In Him,
Patty 

Now that we have Alina's initial visit out of the way and she has stopped talking about the bad ("jaman") nurse that gave her the shots,  I guess it's time to plan round two.

Please let me know the appropriate timing to schedule a follow-up visit for further immunizations.

Thanks

I worked on the grade level promtion.  I didn't know what her new title was supposed to be. Lynn chcecked with Fran and she told her coordinator.  So I guess we'll have to check back in with Fran

I think your outlined measures sound fine.  I would think we could change to the new hotline almost immediately.

Got your note.  I'm volunteering at school this afternoon and can't open the attachment on my Blackberry.  I'll review and send you a note over the weekend

Okay I'll go for a ticket.

Are you back in town.  Do you want to go to the cafeteria for lunch.

This isn't the language that we ageed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp.  I thought I sent Jim an email over the weekend.  

The language needs to say that Enron has advised that it is willing to treat UBS as an affiliate. .  We cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing -- as this would take agreement of our partners.

11:45

Cyndi,

I have misplaced Lori Schroeder's cell phone number and need to set an appointment with her before Sat!  Help.

Thanks for getting together Sat. -- even if I am bad at picking movies.

Could you make a Dr appt for tomorrow for the Dr on level 3.

Hi,

I just got a really cool software package that is helping me write and
learn Kazakh.  I've attached my first letter.

Lisa and I hope things are going well for you guys.

We're filling out paperwork and getting things notarized almost every day.
And we're getting more excited with each passing document.

How's Alina doing?

Please send us some pictures if you have any.

Love,

Kurt and Lisa

Could you please be so kind as to send me the full shower address list back (my list was missing some addresses).  I want to make sure I get organized to send out thanks after the party.

Hope your week is going well.  Here are a couple of things I wanted to tell you.

1.  I made the arrangements for the house rental, bought 8 baseball tickets each to two of the games where I thought day of the game seats would be hard to come by & got our airline tickets.

2.  Hopefully you got the invitation from Cyndi/Rosemary for Sat.  I know you have Karate plans that day so I understand if it doesn't suit you.  If you decide to come let me know though.  Grandpa is willing to come and stay with Chad (Kim will be in Indonesia), but I wanted to also see what D&T will be up to.

3. Does any day this week suit you for exercise - walk/run?

Shelley

Hi Georgi,

It's nice to hear from you -- although I wish it were under happier circumstances from your end.  I know that your visited with Mike and Steve on gas control openings.  Please also keep in touch with Rick Dietz for contract group openings and Lynn Blair for potential scheduling openings.  I'll also touch base with them and let them know that you may be responding to upcoming job postings.
Hi Shelley!

Just a note to let you know that I have been looking for work and have applied and interviewed for several positions in gas control.  If you have any other openings available within the pipeline group in scheduling, contracts or accounting, I would appreciate any assistance you can offer. 

As you well know, I have a good work history and would be anxious to hear any input from you.  I really do need a job.

Thanks for your time.

Congrats to you.

It hasn't been announced yet, but to keep you informed, I have been promoted to Director effective 02/01. I received the official word this morning. Apparently a memo will go out shortly with several promotions listed. There aren't any planned organizational changes, just a title change.

Thank you for all of your support. I've always enjoyed working in and around Gas Control and hope to continue to do so in the future.

My thoughts are written into the document 
Shelley,

What do you think?

Beez,

Since our telephone conversation concerning the special SPRC meeting, I have
prayed/thought about the topic and have the following opinion.

While I agree that this decision has to be made with the good of the entire
congregation in mind, I would like to say that my family and I feel that our family and the
congregation have benefited from Ernie's practical and humble approach to Christian living.

We have witnessed Ernie handle delicate situations with compassion and
consideration.  We also appreciate Ernie's support during Alina's difficult
transition to our home and at ACEC.  

Ernie may not deliver the most inspiring sermons, may not be as outgoing as prior pastors at
the church, and may not display managerial qualities in dealing with church staff. Certainly these are important considerations, and perhaps the most important considerations for a pastor of a church the size of AUMC. 
But, I just want to make sure I raise up those gifts that I think Ernie has brought to the
church.  Ernie is the type of person that helps to fix a flat tire, helps pack up the folding chairs after
an event, or gives a stranded member a ride home.  In some ways it seems to me that Ernie is more comfortable
leading by quiet example than being a formal leader.  I believe that it has been good for our congregation to
see that a pastor can get his hands dirty in the process of pastoring to his congregation.

Having said this, both Shelley and I realize that we don't have the day to day contact with
Ernie in the church office setting and don't see the managerial issues that have been raised.  Furthermore, we don't
believe we can afford to have AUMC's membership adversely affected if we intend to grow this church to minister to the needs of our growing community.   In summary, Ernie has my family's support if there is any opportunity to work through the concerns that have been raised, but AUMC is our home and whatever is best for AUMC, that is the direction we should take.  I will support the SPRC's decision.

Kim  

Can they come in the afternoon on Feb 18 (President's Day)?  I have an appointment with the tax lady in the AM.

Can you see about getting Alina a Dentist appointment on Mar 1 at 8 AM  (or at 1 PM) ?  Is it time for Chad to have an appointment again?  Chad has off school on Mar 1 & I plan to take a vacation day.  Alina has an appointment for more vaccinations with Dr Kline at 10 AM.  We may go to the zoo after that.

Q,

What days are you available for Sundeck to come out?

Kim

I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.

We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.

Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.

Thank you
Shelley (making good use of my jury duty time)

Hi. Hope your week is going well.  I'm discouraged to still be sick (asthma or bronchitis or the like).
Also, I'm sure that you have heard the perils of Enron.  Then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news.  I am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend.  What would you think about tryin to coordinate hair appointments Sat?  My only constraint is Chad's noon soccer game.  If hair doesn't work then how about coffee?

Not at this time.  I plan to continue to use my personal American Express.

Shelley, would you like one of these corp MasterCard's?

Thank you, Ricki

The correct fax number for the T&E card applications is (713) 646-6040

I am pleased to announce completion of negotiations with Wright Express to provide a travel and entertainment program for Enron Operations Services Company.

Please feel free to give me a call anytime.  Work is better.  Home is still kind of crazy!

Shelley,
I just got down through my email to your emails with pictures. No, you had 
not already sent them and I want to thank you for taking them and sending 
them. Let me know when you are up for a chat.

Liz

I love Aigerim and visited with her on my recent trip to Taraz.  I took lots of pictures of Aigerim and
if you send me your mailing address I'll send them.  I am very interested in Aigerim's placement.  Let me know either way about your decision.  If you decide not to adopt her I would love to continue to advocate for her.

Hi, how's it going? Anything new on your end?
We heard from Ginger that a child named Aigerim who is from Taraz became
available.  She is from a different orphanage in Taraz.  She stayed in
the HOuston Area.  She is Kazak and speaks only Kazak.  She is five and
will turn 6 in March.  Did you meet any the kids from the Houston area.
Tonya Hoppe has sent me lots of pictures.  We are unsure and want to
wait until we are over to find a sibling for Anastasia.
I asked if they had a travel date, and Atwa told us no.  My work is
wanting to know when so they can find a replacement doc.  One of the
ATWA staff is due to travel on FEB 15th and she still does not have a
travel date.  Is this crazy or what?  I wonder if the other agencies
keep you hanging like this or if this is just our luck.   never boring,
tina

Somewhere convenient to Jim since he has to come from Beltway/EOTT.  Will he come down Wetheimer?  If so we can meet at Highland Village - Grotto is it?  Or if he comes down I-10n then ??

She has absolutely everything.  A gift isn't necessary.  I'm working on family pictures for her -- so a recent one of you guys would be great.  And, if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story.

Call me anytime for info.  I'll let you know the next time I'll be in DC and you are always welcome to hop on down to Houston for a weekend.  Tracey is coming next weekend.  We'll be in State College around July 4.

Keep me posted!

Pressure to finish my review! My husband is in Indonesia on business, so don't be surprised if I reply in the middle of the night when kids are asleep and I can concentrate

What a nice note.  I hope you are feeling better.

Met sounds good

Janice told me that he would be in the office today.  Would The Met be OK?

Thanks, Ricki

Great.  Thanks again for going out of your way to meet Alina and join in the party welcoming her.  You're the best!

I hope you didn't spend a lot of time looking in the apartment for my eye makeup.  I found what I lost this a.m.  Thanks again.  Maria

Stan tells me that in 2002 I will have the privilege of representing the pipeline segment on the GISB Board.  Will you be letting Rae McQuade know the results of the pipeline segment board elections?

Jayshree - give me a call this afternoon at your convenience. I've fact checked the IM and have a couple of questions for you and some language suggestions.

Sorry that was the wrong draft.  Here is the latest.  (I am sure that there will be spelling errors but I am more focused on content and will do a really thorough spell check at the end.)

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Sorry that was the wrong draft.  Here is the latest.  (I am sure that there will be spelling errors but I am more focused on content and will do a really thorough spell check at the end.)

 

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Yes

added Steve Harris at 1:30 to discuss floor plan, your ofc.

Also, I have a call into Mike Nelsons assistant to find out if he has a preference for lunch.  Is The Met OK with you?

Thanks, Ricki

I'm fine with the 1-2% growth rate, but think we need to make an assumption about the major contracts that expire 10/31/03.  

I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. 
2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. 
3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption 
4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Thanks,
Kevin

Thank you for your update.  Our hearts are very heavy today for Rich and his family.
I, on behalf of Infinite Energy, would like to offer my deepest sympathies to Richard Blaser, Executive Vice President of Infinite Energy, and his family.  Richard's parents were in a plane crash this past weekend.    
 
Russ and Carol Blaser were celebrating a friend's 40th birthday with his wife by eating out in Cedar Key, Florida.  They flew out to Cedar Key and were intending to fly back to Gainesville after the celebratory dinner.  Russ Blaser was an accomplished and experienced pilot and in fact had participated in many air shows with his stunt plane.   
 
Shortly after takeoff from Cedar Key, the plane Russ was flying crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Richard's mom was killed and his father has not yet been found. 
 
The date for the funeral of Carol Blaser has not yet been set.  I will relay any relevant information regarding funeral arrangements and Russ Blaser's status to those on this email list as they become available.  
 
Please take a moment to think of Rich and his family.
 
Darin
 
 

Jayshree - here are some thoughts on the IM.  I still can't tie to the top customer revenue figures.  Please give me a call to compare notes.

 

This table has IES instead of Alliant.  Alliant is customer # 7 in the table already included in the document.  

Brad,

Please find the attached with the information you requested.  This information is based on data compiled back at the beginning of November 2001.  If you need additional information, please let me know.

 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Hi Mom,

Chad just loves his apple checkboard.  Thanks again for it.

I am still feeling sick.  Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma, but I'm still feeling puny.  I trying to get in to see if I have a touch of bronchitis or something.

I'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it.  Ordinarily, I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list.  It seems kind of rude and presumptious.  However, given that we may be traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal questions I receive about what Mr. Chad is into -- I thought I'd provide this list:

Things Chad Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyone asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than $20)

-Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows)  (more expensive item)
-Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows)
-Harry Potter Trading Cards
-Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs"
-Harry Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item)
-Ultra Grip Nerf Football

Incidentally, Chad is asking Santa for the Harry Potter Legos Set, a Levitating Game and an Air Snare Drum Game.

More Later

Shelley

That's so sweet.  Sorry our time on the phone was short this morning.  As you well know, 6:50 AM is chaos at our house!

My sister is coming this weekend.  She arrives on Sat. at 11 AM and leaves on Tues.  Since you get home late Sat, I am anticipating that you'll want to sleep on Sunday.  Sunday afternoon we are going to Mary Beth Schatzman's birthday party at a Mexican restaurant.  Sunday morning the kids choir sings. 

Last night the Kudla's came over and we ate take-out.  Christopher broke one of the plates on the wall in the dining room and was very active.   I was pretty tired by the time I got everyone to bed.

Work is very stressful this week.  Tonight we are going to try to make it to Karate and we have to write out everyone's Valentine's cards.

I love you too.

Q

Q,

I know this is early, but I wanted to tell you today so that you can go home
tonight and retrieve something that I left for you and the kids.  Open my
top drawer in my dresser in the closet and you'll find your little surprise.

Hopefully my little token will make up for me not being there on Valentines
Day.  I love you and I'm always thinking of my three Valentines.

Love Kim

Can you please take care of this?

Shelley, do you have an extra copy of version 1.5 of GISB Standards?  FGU is looking for a copy.  Tom

Hey guys,

	I sent an amendment to Dan McCarty, for signoff by the NNG President. last week (before the memo) and was told that Danny would no longer be signing agreements for NNG; Danny instructed me to send the agreements to Dan Dienstbier.  Well, Dan Dienstbier just told me he can't sign them either.  Who is the interim NNG President/General Manager?  Any suggestions?

Craig

Lynn and Steve will attend for me.

Mike,

Per your request for information to assist you on a NM tax matter,  attached is a summary of measured receipts into the Transwestern system by state for the period 
April 2001 to June 2001.

 << File: recpt by state.xls >> 

Sorry we were unable to have a staff meeting this morning.  I would like to have a brief (1 hr) staff meeting tomorrow or Friday instead.  Please let Ricki know about your availability.

I will be out of the office next Tuesday morning.  In my absence I have asked Mike Bryant to sit in on Stan's staff meeting and Steve January to sit in on Dan Dienstbier's meeting (both moved to Tues. due to President's Day holiday).   Please see that the normal Monday morning updates are set to these folks.  

Lynn will compile the NNG Gas Logistics bullets and send to Drew/Emily Sellers.  Donna Scott will compile similar style weekly bullets for FGT/TW/ETS.  Donna check with Toby regarding the proper posting of these bullets.

Thanks

I love you too.  Thanks for the surprise.  Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt.  He especially loved the special kiss.

They both have the sniffles and I have a sore throat.  Man I don't want to get sick again.

Happy Valentine's Day

I can do any of these dates.  If we go to lunch on Feb 19 -- then my sister will be along with us.

Rosemary and Shelley:

I can could do lunch the 19th, 26, or week of March 4.  Fun!  I'll make the reservations (using Rosemary's name!)  C.

Please advise

My preference is to send out the notice as a Staff Meeting w/ Halloween Snacks.  I'd rather it be just us for this meeting.

Shelley,
39C1 is available from 3:00 - 4:00 pm on Tuesday, Oct. 30.  Would you like to have a social get together for your groups?  I was thinking of maybe a Halloween cake and ice cream social.  Maybe even invite marketing.  What are your thoughts?
Donna

Sorry I missed you this morning.  Could you take a look at this description from the outline.    I checked with John O'Shea and its fine for us to work together on this. I'm back in my office.  Please give me a call at your convenience (x37083)

Competitive Threats

Northern's competitive position is bolstered by the presence of (1) long-term agreements, and (2) a configuration of small-diameter branchlines with multiple delivery points that function as an extension of the LDC's distribution system.

Minnesota:
?	Northern's major Minnesota customers have contracts that extend through 2007.  Beyond current contract terms, there is a mid-high possibility of bypass in Minneapolis/Twin cities area (Alliance, Viking or Northern Border); low-medium bypass possibilities in Rochester and Mankato, MN (Alliance).
Iowa:
?	Northern recently extended the contract with its major Iowa customer (MidAmerican) thru 2005.   Beyond current contract terms, Northern will face competitive threats from NGPL in the Des Moines and Sioux City.

Wisconsin/Chicago:
?	With several significant contract terms up for renewal in 2003, Northern will face competitive pressures in the Wisconsin and Chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines.   To some extent these competitive factors have already been recognized, as Wisconsin Gas has already bypassed Northern via Great Lakes.    The distance of competing pipelines to many Northern towns will preclude bypass for many others.  

Major competitors in the market area include:
?	Alliance
?	ANR Great Lakes
?	Natural Gas Pipeline
?	Northern Border
?	Trailblazer
Viking 

Saturday night sounds good.  My sister will be here!

Things are going fine at home...but we'll be happy to have Kim home!

Although it is only Tuesday, I am already trying to plan for the weekend.
John's brother Gib is visiting us and we were hoping to see you (sans Kim)
on Saturday for dinner ... at Lupe's? 

How is it going in Kim's absence? If I can assist in any way, please let me
know.

Greg,

Typically I sign all these EDI trading partner agreements with Lee Huber's initials.  Can we get the proper agency/delegations in place so that I can continue to sign without further ado so long as the agreements are identical to the GISB standard agreement.  We can put in place a separate procedure for any non-standard TPAs?

Shelley,

Will you be able to continue executing the Northern Natural Gas Company TPAs?  If not, can you tell me who will so that I can update the TPA on the website.

Thanks,
Mary

Any numbers for me?

We will have the Great River and Power Tex information together very soon after lunch...

Can you send me the latest version?

Also, I am expecting to shortly have the power plant numbers to add for the 1 market and 1 southend power plant per year based on actual annualized revenues from a recent market power plan (Great River) and southend (PowerTex).

Great Rosemary,
 
I'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party.  You are the best.
 
My sister will be here for our lunch on Monday too.  We're going to be out shopping that day.

the 19th is the best for me; 11:45? This will be fun!!! Christi, I am happy to make the reservations if you want! 

Rosemary 

Hi Shelley,

Here is the latest.

 

Stan/Rod,

I previously mentioned to you that I have assigned John Buchanan as Mgr, TW scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on TW scheduling matters and presence at the 8 AM TW morning meeting (Lynn Blair, Steve January and Terry Kowalke are in the NNG morning meeting each day at the same time).

Previously Terry Kowalke and John Buchanan split time advising the TW and NNG team on day to day scheduling matters.  Terry was sitting on 39 and John on 42.  In light of the immediate change in their assignments, I asked John and Terry to switch desks.  I need you authorization to move their telephones.

This change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both NNG and TW that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition.  

Thank you for the support.  

It's not final yet.  I'll forward the latest copy that Jayshree sent me yesterday afternoon.  I still need to check that all our comments were added.

Shelley:  

Can you provide a copy of the final NNG IM to me please?  

Thanks

Brad

You could never be a bother.  A woman serving food at a volunteer event always has a special place in my heart.
 
 
I bought the Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken & the caesar salad bowls (in plastic bowls - near fruit bowls) from Albertson.  Just added some extra parmesan.

Hi Shelley: 
I am helping to host a Girl Scout snack supper for 50 adults tomorrow evening, and I am thinking about making the grilled chicken salad like you made for the VBS planning meeting.  Can you tell me if you bought pre-cooked chicken, and if so where you got it?  Also, was that just romaine lettuce you used, or pre-mixed greens?  Did you toss a dressing in the salad, and if so, what kind? 
(Sorry to bother you with this - if you don't have time to respond I totally understand!) 
Thanks, 
Barbara

I'll gladly bring my photo album and Alina.  Chad has a playdate at a neighbors house.

Gaby told me that she cannot attend.

You mentioned that several people may come to the get together late and that we may visit longer than 12:30 pm.  My sister is arriving in town for a visit around 12PM and a cab is picking her up at the airport.  I currently have arrangements for the cab driver to take her to my house (probably around 1 PM). Let me know if you think I should change this arrangement.   

I can't think of anyone we missed for the party, except Bobby Oldfield.  She is going to start working with us on Children's Church and was a fantastic help with VBS.  I inadvertently dropped her name from the list.  

Thank you for everything you do.  I'm always overwhelmed by your kindness.

Shelley

Hi Shelley:
I am looking forward to seeing you and Alina tomorrow for the shower.  It 
will be great to have the opportunity to visit with you.
Just so you know, Laura and Kathryn will be here tomorrow and can help 
entertain Alina if needed.
There are several people that I have not heard from as far as RSVP's.  We 
will have plenty of food, so if anyone asks you, please tell them just to 
come!
Take care,
Barbara
P.S.  By the way, if you have any pictures or mementos from your trip that 
you might like to share, bring them along.

Here are a few more minor edits I saw in the latest IM

 

I am looking for a way to assist a co-worker that is under stress with a wife with health problems, a baby and two other children at home.  I am interested in getting details about how I might pre-pay for a two-week personal chef service.  

Could you give me a quote on two-week service to this family located in the Copperfield area? 
Would you deliver the pre-made meals to the home?  Could the gift recipient select the menu items?

Kevin,
We can get ETS-related pipe throughput for 2001 (and Rick has subsequently sent the TW 2001 data).  But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish.

I'm confused - I thought we had throughput data on a more timely manner? Is it the specific format that is the problem or the data itself? If we want to estimate it, that would be fine also.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Rick

 << File: Pipeline Capacity and T-put - NNG - TW - FGT.xls >> 

Kevin Howard suggested that I contact you regarding some data for the attached slide.  I am looking for average throughput for four pipes in 2001.  Please let me know if you have this information.

Thank you,

Michael

 << File: 2001 Throughput.ppt >> 

Jayshree,

I j found three more minor nits.  

 

Sorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number. 

In the NNG commercial folks original budget they forcasted $1.2 M revenue growth from $25 million 2002 Capital.  So my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation, then $25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth.

One question, on the $1,000,000 margin per additional power plant that we are assuming for growth, is there any capex associated with that growth?  What about any increase in O&M expense?

Thanks,
Jayshree

Jayshree,

I j found three more minor nits.  

 << File: Northern  IMv2.doc >> 

We should change all refernces to say top 10 customers provide 66 percent of revenues .  I changed that in one prior draft.  The other figure is the top 15 contracts.  I think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats

There are a couple of slides in the recent bank package NNG prepared and a few more slides in the original 2002 budget package.  I'm a vacation day but have to stop by the office later today and will round these up 

Thanks.  No-Notice Imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing.  The only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price.
Okay.  I did not originally include the no notice quantities in the market area imbalances.  I or Galen can get that info from the monthly excel spreadsheets.  I will start gathering that data.  

I consider the no notice to be part of the market imbalance for this analysis.

Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.  The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.  So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.  I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case

Tomorrow morning!

Okay - so I see that it's Orlando Cogen (not Orange).  I'm unclear what the relationship is with El Paso.  Do they own 100% of Orlando Cogen?  Are they the designee?  Have they sent correspondence to us that El Paso is now owner or contact party for this contract?

Jimmy,  we could use a helping hand in collecting about $518 K from Orlando Cogen for their January reservation billing.  Marion has called them on several occasions this week and they simply are not responding to her messages.  We have several small customers we're still chasing, but Orlando is the most significant outstanding issue we have left.  Could you give me a call in the morning so we can discuss.  Thks! Sheila

Can I see the Trunkline OBA too

Sharon

I'm not sure Sheila is the one for sign off.
Also, I'm not sure we have our act together.
We need to do that before the draft goes out.
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances.
Given our recent discussions, they may be too low.
If anything, it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines.
(Maybe we need some more "official" guidelines.)
If Trunkline sees these numbers, it may be hard to change the tolerances.
Finally, Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments.
I will continue to press for input.

Frazier

Why can't we just get Sheila's signoff.    It isn't like we are doing anything radical here.   Trunkline hasn't even seen it yet, so they might make more changes --- it's just our standard GISB agreement.   I think Trunkline should actually review before Shelley anyway.   (for discussion purposes)

Sharon,

I have placed several calls to Shelley about the Trunkline OBA.
I have not heard back and she is not in today.
So, I just sent the draft to Mike to get his input.

Frazier

I just got this message.  I assume it is an old message or do you have a new injury?

Shelley,

I scratched my cornea playing basketball or have a conjunctivitis infection in my eye.  I have a doctor's appointment for 11:00 on Tuesday.

Are you at all worried that this starts the move to zone rates in the market area?  Do we care?  Are we worried about having competitive Zone E/F rates?

If all of marketing is in agreement and we can demonstrate the elements sufficently to include in the filing.  How will this work in the field area??  Doesn't this conceptually give everyone the same priority or we narrowing it down to within the MID?  MK

In our meetings today on Order No. 637, we failed to discuss the topic of alternate point priorities "within-the-path". Marketing indicated in a meeting yesterday that they would like a change to alternate rights in the Market Area.  That change would provide that use of an alternate point within the operational zone where the shipper's primary rights are located would have priority over alternate rights in an operational zone where the shipper doesn't have primary.  This means we would have another level of alternate to be added to the tariff.  For example, if Minnegasco made an alternate nomination in Zone D at E.Dubuque, they would have a lower alternate right than Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.
 
Please provide any comments you have on this issue along with your other comments requested to be provided to Maria by COB on Monday.  
 
p.s. I recognize this would fall into the category of "needing system changes so it may take awhile".

When you have a chance - can we talk about this?

2:30 works for me.  

Are you available around 2:30?  I wanted to come up and give you an update on a few things.  It will probably take an hour or so.  

Brad

We received a call this morning from a gentleman, Todd Bearden (954-981-1101), who recently moved into a home in Hollywood FL and is trying to obtain information about gas service, could one of you pass this request on the appropriate person at NUI-City Gas or TECO/PGS?   

I consider the no notice to be part of the market imbalance for this analysis.

Please coordinate a meeting next week between Don Hawkins, myself and Rod Hayslett for Don & I to discuss a proposal for NNG Measurement with Rod.  

Another concern I have is that once we say that we can path -- then we've lost our best argument against physical segmentation.

Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:

Rod,
 
I received Don's memo before I sent out the memo that we had talked about -- so I turned the thoughts into reply comments.

Would you guys be amenable to signing up the boys for Nature Explorer Camp July 29-Aug 2.  The Audubon lady said that I can sign Chad up with the 7-8's if he's going to be with a 7-year old buddy.

Summer Schedule
I'm not planning any camps for Chad the week of June 3 because of Swim Team (really busy first week of June).  

June 10-14 is Grace VBS

We'll be on vacation week of July 1-7

Ashford VBS July 22-26

Hopefully Nature Explorer Camp week July 29 - Aug 2.

I'd like to sign him up Biron's or some other camp 1 or more weeks (either):
June 24-28
July 8-12
July 15-19

Yes I can either meet you at noon or at 3 PM take your pick.  I have to take the Kid's to a b-day party from 1:30-3PM -- Kim can watch them afterwards.

I'd like to go to Neiman Marcus last call.
 
Hi! I hope your week has gone well. I'm checking in to see if you have time
tomorrow afternoon to meet for coffee or to otherwise get together. John and
I are doing some yardwork in the morning and he and Miss B will go to his
hockey game in the afternoon -- thus I'llb be free then.

Take care, C

How did you make sure it was the right set?  Will it be delivered?

I,m so excited.  This will make my week.

can you resend.  There was no attachment

FYI

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.  

We are pursuing this matter with Bill Donovan and the building/security staff.

Great.  Last week I was invited to a forum, but I was disappointed that I could not attend.

FYI - I was selected to attend a facilitated focus group meeting to candidly discuss the current environment of Enron from a mid level management point of view.  If anything comes out of this meeting that sounds particularly interesting, I will let you know.  

Also, if there is a topic you would like me to comment on, please let me know your thoughts.

Rick

Thank you for agreeing to attend the "Sr. Director/Director Focus Group" Meeting scheduled for Wednesday, October 24, 2001.  The focus group will begin at 11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. in EB/ECN 16C1.  Lunch will be provided.

I'll try to attend this meeting if you need me.  I have a CLE class out of the office from 12-2 today.  But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.  I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & Jim have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.   If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.  I'm all for automation and less manual intervention.

Shelley--If you have time on your schedule, would you also attend this meeting.  The reason I've scheduled this meeting is to determine exactly what it is John Keiser needs for cash flow analysis and what we can do to automate Jerry's process such that it doesn't require so much manual intervention and is more dependable.  (Marion spends too much time reconciling to Jerry's spreadsheet when she needs to be contacting customers for collections.)  I believe Jerry put this together for you, so your thoughts would be appreciated.  Sheila  (We're meeting in EB3907 at 2:30 pm.)

 Attached is the Agenda and attachments for the Monday PM Cash Flow meeting. For those of you who are not real familiar with the process, we are attaching all related files to give you a chance to prepare for the meeting.

Please bring your copy to the meeting.

Wednesday will work best for me.  Say 11:45 at the Daily Review?

Hi! I hope you enjoyed the rest of your weekend. The weather was simply
beautiful. We did some extensive yardwork. Luckily we didn't plant much
since it is supposed to be chilly this week.

Brianna and I loved the sing-a-long Sound of Music. It was great fun. I'd go
again next weekend!

Let me know which day is best for us to have lunch --Wednesday or Thursday.

Would one of be able to email this gentleman.  He called me again this morning looking for information on connecting a well to Northern.
I'm not sure if you are the person I need to be contacting, so if you're not 
maybe you can lead me in the right direction.

I am in the process of working on a gas well in Hodgeman County, Kansas;
Section 18, T21S, R22W.  The BTU test for a well in the vicinity came back 
at 723BTU.  699.25 Methane, 14.64 Ethane, 4.77 Propane, 1.3 Isobutane, 0.98 
Normal Butane, 0.4 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 1.51 Hexanes.  Mole % is 
69.45 Methane, 0.83 Ethane, 0.19 Propane, 0.04 Isobutane, 0.03 Normal 
Butane, 0.01 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 0.03 Hexanes, 28.45 Nitrogen, 
0.04 Oxygen, 0 Carbon Dioxide, 0.93 Helium, and 0 Hydrogen.

Do you have a pipeline in the vicinity, and would you be able to purchase or 
transport the forementioned quality of gas.

If you could inform me on pipelines who could service this well please send 
me an e-mail.

Thank you.

Ricki - would you please:

1. Make reservations at 11:45 on Thurs for Judy Johnson & I at Duck & Co in Hyatt

2. Set up a pre-meeting for Don Hawkins & I before our meeting with Rod tomorrow

3. Move my Wed. staff meeting to run from 10-11:30 (instead of 9-10).  Since we no longer have a Wash office, I plan to watch the Commission meeting myself

I'm confused how this fits in with the projects that we recently had Dynegy approve.  Is this one of the discretionary network upgrade projects that they agreed to support?  Or one of the other discretionary projects that we didn't have funding for before 6/30/02 anyway?

Shelley and Steve,

As you know, we have been working with facilities to develop options to replace or improve our 75KVA UPS that provides power to the Gas Control environment. My recommendation at this time is that we stand pat with the current 75KVA UPS and the redundancy that we currently have in place. Given the uncertainties of the status and ownership of the 40KVA UPS on EB44, and given Mr. Cooper's stated intention of moving out of this building, it simply doesn't make sense to spend the $28K estimated to leverage the 40KVA UPS on EB44. I've talked with Randy Lord and he is comfortable with us continuing to rely on the 75KVA unit for the near term. 

I do want to thank facilities for their efforts, particularly Charles Upshaw, who provided a great deal of assistance in reviewing what equipment was available and how we might leverage the equipment.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary

I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on Mar 9 (Astros) and Mar 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.  We just pulled schedules from the web.

My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to FL, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.  I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us .... but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans.

Per my earlier email --- this is the maintenance company's response.

Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the go=
vernor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is desi=
gned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r=
isk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod=
ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=
com in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=
n why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=
 intercom is repaired.

There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=
 bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=
 levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=
 the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=
e previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=
taff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=
ly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=
 site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=
 over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=
ms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=
,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=
 have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=
complished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=
ldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=
 tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20

While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=
ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=
r functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=
r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =
them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =
Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=
nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=
 this time it was significant.=20

This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=
 corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =
it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=
acted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =
proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=
uccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=
 Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=
d that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=
 at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=
indler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=
ator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=
dler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=
 in an extra hour before help arrived.

I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =
no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=
rapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=
vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=
 the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =
these inspections since they have people here at night. =20

I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=
terday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=
 not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=
onally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=
cceptable.

Randy

Thanks for your concern.  While it was very scary for Helen, I'm satisfied with Randy's reply.

I don't know who/what got everything stirred up today.  It is true I have other offers, but none are new -- I've been thinking about them for several weeks and haven't made up my mind.  I'll let you know when I figure it out!

Tim,

Is the activity at the MidLouisiana points normal.  How did we build up a 156,000 MMBtu balance at Port Hudson.  Is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch?  How big is this point?

Please find the attached.

Thanks,  Tim << File: 022602.XLS >>  << File: MORNMEET.XLS >> 

Return to Ricki and she can take care of it

I'm not sure, Alma, but I thought it is Ricki.

Shelley, Alma coordinates the pager activity for most of the people in the group, but yours is not one of them.  Would you like Alma to track down the person at Skytel to return your pager to or would you prefer she just hand it over to Ricki?  We do not want to continue to pay for your pager now that you have a blackberry.

Rick

Fawn Borger was told by Ricki to return Shelley's Pager to me.  Do you have any idea who pays for Shelley's pager?
	Alma G.

Here are a few thoughts.
 
 

Attached is Dari's and my attempt to draft tariff language and an explanatory statement regarding a negotiated "System Flow Request" that may be incorporated into Northern's 637 filing.  Please provide comments by COB, Tuesday February 26th.  Thanks MW
 

Tim - The denominator in the load factor calculations needs to be updated.  Please check with Mike to get the current denominator for the months.
Please find the attached.

Thanks,  Tim 

Yes

18.            The primary term of this Agreement shall be from the Effective Date until cancelled upon fortyeight (8)-eight (48) hours prior written notice prior to the gas day by either Party or by other provisions herein.
 

Ann,

Per Rod Hayslett, you are able to process changes to list B to accommodate instances in which Dynegy & ETS can agree on the specific assignment of an individual.

Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva are both currently company 179 employees.  We moved both of these individuals to list C because we anticipated that one of the two might need to stay to support deal capture/contracts/data requests for TW.  Craig Buehler has subsequently indicated his plans to leave the company if he is not assigned to list B.  Dave Neubauer has requested that Craig be moved to list B and both Rick Dietz (Craig's immediate supervisor) and I are in agreement.  And, if we agree to move Craig to list B, we need to make the same accommodation for Esther DaSilva.  Dave Neubauer is in agreement with this revision as well.  

Accordingly, please move Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva from List C to List B.

FYI - we will use another contract position vacancy to cover TW deal capture/contracts/data requests if deemed necessary.

Thanks
Shelley

I'll await Mike's email.  Thanks.  

Shelley, first of all, I apologize for not responding in a timely manner.  I should have responded that we were waiting to gather additional comments, if any, and make one global response.  mea culpa.
Second, I received an email from Mike Mcgowan just a few moments ago wherein he is proposing a response to your request.  By copy of this memo, you can anticipate that Mike will forward a response shortly.
Again, sorry for the inconvenience.    

Ditto Happy Birthday From Me Too!  Was I the first D-In-Law to wish you Happy Birthday?

Mom,

Happy Birthday.  Was I the first?  Can't what to see you this weekend.
Think about where you want to go to dinner.

Let's see if Sheila can attend too

Sounds good.  Is Marion comfortable with the plan?

Results of Monday meeting:
1)  Marion will continue to maintain a spreadsheet of outstanding shipper receivables for reservation, commodity and cash in/out balances.
2)  Marion will supply John K & Sally with an estimate on Friday for the upcoming week of expected cash flow based on the history of cash received (using Jerry's existing spreadsheet) and maintaining an ongoing daily cash receipts balance (at a high level).
3)  Reviewing whether the invoice due date can be moved up to follow tariff, ie, net 10 days falls on Sunday, can  invoice due date be on Friday (9th) prior to Sunday (11th).
4)  Jerry S will follow up with the SAP IT team to automate his report after reviewing report requirements with John K, Rick & myself.
5)  MS Reps will follow up with customers sending cash in to Enron office rather than lockbox or by wire.
 
We plan to give this a try for a month.  If problem arise, we will reconsider the decisions.  

Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.

A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.

Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week. 

Thanks.  I'll keep you posted.

Hi Shelley:

Again I will be working at camp the week of VBS, so I would love to be
able to help beforehand.  If there is anything I can do, registration or
supplies, etc. please let me know.  I will not be able to make the lunch
on Sunday.--Jo Glaves

Can you please advise what is going on with the flat panels that we had planned to distribute to our gas logistics team.  It was in the budget and we had the okay, but now I'm hearing there is some hold-up & the units are stored on 44.

Shelley

Does that mean Rita will need to go through security every day?  My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old Enron badge for the full week.

What I would like to do is give Rita a temp badge every day.  Do you see a problem with this?

The most ability is responsibility.  Nothing happens until someone steps forward and says, "You can count on me."

Holly, I work for Northern Natural Gas Company and in March we are going to be working on a rate refund for our customers.  Usually when we do this, we need the help of Rita Bianchi who was a Northern employee until February 1, 2002 when she became a Dynegy employee.  I was wondering if we could get Rita's badge (#40024) activated for the time that she will need to be down here to help with the rate refund which will be from March 18 thru March 24.  She will need access to the 42nd floor which is the floor that I work on plus the 40th floor which is the floor that our IT people work on.  Please let me know if we can get this to work since that would make it so much easier for her to come and go for the time that she will be down here with us.

Thanks for your help,

I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.

The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:

1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.

2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.

Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.  

The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.

I didn't understand we were borrowing them.  I thought we already reached agreement to buy them.

Jeffri,

I recently received a Schedule K-1 form from SSB.  I sending you an overnight package with the form to add to my other tax materials.

Yes.  Of course I'm still here.  I think my NNG friends are spreading the rumor that I'm out of here!  But, I just keep busy with my day to day work and try to put of making any decisions...

Are you still here?  Haven't seen or heard from you in a couple of days.  Hope you weren't upset at me for digging you about the TV 
appearance.  Did you  meet with Deb?

I haven't visited with Stan lately.  Why do you ask?  I know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that I and others are looking for.  I'll try to sit Down with him next week.  I'm not planning on doing anything this week.

What is an Ambassador Doll and where can I buy one?

Thanks so much for lunch yesterday!

I looked up Nancy Kline's info. She is a nurse practitioner who also has a
Ph.D. -- a real underachiever.

I'm actually working with Mark Kline on their idea for an Ambassador Doll.
We are trademarking it. 

Have a good day.

CB

FYI

Unfortunately, with her being a non-employee she will need to get a temp badge everyday.  The other option would be to have her sign in as a visitor and have an escort.  I will let the Security Kiosk know that she will be coming that week and to issue a temp badge.
Thanks

Does that mean Rita will need to go through security every day?  My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old Enron badge for the full week.

What I would like to do is give Rita a temp badge every day.  Do you see a problem with this?

The most ability is responsibility.  Nothing happens until someone steps forward and says, "You can count on me."

Holly, I work for Northern Natural Gas Company and in March we are going to be working on a rate refund for our customers.  Usually when we do this, we need the help of Rita Bianchi who was a Northern employee until February 1, 2002 when she became a Dynegy employee.  I was wondering if we could get Rita's badge (#40024) activated for the time that she will need to be down here to help with the rate refund which will be from March 18 thru March 24.  She will need access to the 42nd floor which is the floor that I work on plus the 40th floor which is the floor that our IT people work on.  Please let me know if we can get this to work since that would make it so much easier for her to come and go for the time that she will be down here with us.

Thanks for your help,

Raetta

Texas Gas Transmission Corporation   				Docket No.
RP01-278-002
                                                      
	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
"RIMS" link, select "Docket#" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the "e-Filing" link.

Alina's Dr. appt is at 10 in the medical center.  We'll have to have her go first at the dentist in case the dentist appointment runs long?

I was planning pasta for dinner.  I am not going to the Bunco game until 7 PM.

Chad should be in a really good mood -- since I put the treasure map in his lunch to find his post Stanford 9 Test present (Battletops) when he gets home.

Q,

I will be ordering pizza tonight, so please don't make other arrangements.

What time is Alina's doctor appointment tomorrow?

fyi, Kathy will be doing a manual invoice and a journal voucher to reverse the manual invoice that we originally did - if you have any other questions, please let me know.

Upon further review with Frank regarding the alternate point usage on contract 23844 for the months of November '00, December '00, January '01, February '01 and March '01, it was determined there wasn't a violation.  MidAmerican is allowed 50,000 MMBtu/day delivered to alternate delivery points in association with contract 23844.  This information was overlooked at the time and since has been evaluated.  Please make the necessary corrections so that it is reflected that MEC did not have any alternate point use charges for those months .  If you need additional documentation, please let me know.
Thanks,

Shelley,

Jeanne mentioned there was supposed to be some new language for the profomas for the Phase IV or Phase V filing.  Do you know anything thing about this or who I should talk to?

Linda

I approve.

Hi Shelley:

How are things going at home?  I hope ya'll are settling in a bit and things
are going smoother.

We had our trustee meeting last night and the subject of inventory came up.
I remember two or three years ago, we took an extensive inventory and that
each head of each group at the church inventoried their items.  I remember
doing the sanctuary and Steve doing the music inventory.  Do you know where
all the paperwork is?  Do you have it on your computer or does Lisa or
someone else?  If so, could you email it to me?  or give me the originals?
Jim said he didn't see it in the stuff you gave him.  He also can't find the
Trustee Master Binder; do you know where it is?

Thanks.

Syd  see you Saturday depending on how my gum surgery goes on Thursday.

Thanks for the update.
	To further respond to questions about the ENA imbalance as we reported in the accounts meeting on Thursday, the Receipt Point imbalance of 9,896 was the result of measurement PPA's for Nov. 01,  Oct. 01, and Aug. 01 at Matagorda 665 and Northwest Frisco on ENA's pooling agreement k5166. 
           The No Notice imbalance of 1,616 that was recorded as ENA's imbalance should have been on Pratt and Whitney's own DPOA contract, but was not because the old system and the new system needed to be synchronized.  Most of this imbalance was traded with FGU (they forgot about the 40 mmbtus of fuel) leaving only a small amount on ENA.  This situation has now been repaired so it will not be a problem prospectively.  Starting February,  the Pratt and Whitney point in on FGU's DPOA.

Rita,

I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year.  Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.  Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?

Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.  
 
 
Attached for your review and information is a copy of the Restated 2002 Capital Budget (25 page report) which reflects the planned CAPEX recently agreed to between NNG/Dynegy and Enron.
 
Feel free to contact Mike McGowan (402.398.7110) or Don Vignaroli (402.398.7139) with questions or comments.

Thanks for talking to Ange.  I'll give her a call tonight.

My preference is for me to take 3/17; you to take 3/24 (I'll have company); and no children's church on Easter.  Let me know what you think.

Shelley

Hi Shelley:
I talked to Ange yesterday, and she and Bobbie can lead C/C this Sunday 3/10. 
 She stopped by my house today and picked up all the materials.  Sorry to not 
have told you earlier of my plans for this weekend.  It's all worked out, 
thankfully.
Let me know what you want to do the rest of the Sundays in March.  I'm 
available for any of the remaining Sundays in March, including Easter.  I 
know I owe you one, so let me know what you would like for me to do.
Thanks for a wonderful luncheon yesterday.  I think things are off to a good 
start with VBS!
Barbara

To ETS IRM:  Please set me up with the ability to open, modify, and save files in the following directory:  common on 'gthou-dv01' (P:), then Mkt_proc folder.  
Shelley, please forward with your approval to allow me access to these ETS procedures files.

No change.  We are to retain all documents.

Shelley,  has there been any change to the document retention policy?  I had planned to throw away a good deal of my old files with this next move, given the space allowance out on the floor.  If we can't pitch the old documents, I will probably have to send them to the records center.  Sn

I'm okay with providing your attached sheet to Jane

Shelly,
I have not responded to  Jane's email.  I created the attached spreadsheet which has a summary of the Contracts and Rates & Revenue Project.  Please review the attached and let me know if we need to discuss.  How would you like for me to handle a response to Jane's email?  Thanks.
 
 
Lisa - we got the revised 2002 capital budget & I'm looking at both your spreadsheet and the budget.  A couple of questions for my clarification:
 

Could you fill in the blanks or correct:
 
        CMS/CRS   

Total Cost for NNG - $_____?____ 

Paid in 2001             $406 K 
Budgeted for 2002    $130 K     
Balance (if any) $___?___      
Remaining customization for NNG is $693K less $300K for Deal Sheet = $393K customization for CMS/CRS (correct?)

CMS/CRS   $100K for Interface to TRS/TAS - Is this considered a separate project from above and if so, is this included anywhere in 2002 Budget?

CAS     

Total Cost $154K, correct?   
Budget for 2002 $54K; is remaining $100K in 2003 or already paid for in 2002?  
What department is this budgeted in (Operations?)

R&R      2002 Plan = $548,481 (of which Deal Sheet is $300 K) 
  Is this total cost or was some paid in 2001 or projected for 2003?        

R&R 2002 Cap Budget shows $548K less $252K paid in Jan. = 296K 
Cap Budget also shows 130K for CMS 
= $426K budgeted in Gas Logistics for CMS & R&R.  
How does that link to the $463K Total Required shown on your worksheet (esp. Interface to TRS/TAS)?

Thanks! Jane

Great.  Just wanted to make sure I was on the right wave length -- as Jane Joyce has asked the IT folks for more detail on the contracts and revenue projects and I didn't want to lead the IT folks astray with my understanding of our meeting if it was incorrect.

Shelley - I was waiting to see if other comments would be submitted.  I will respond today or tomorrow.  Although it should be a basic reponse that your comments are correct. 
 
Hope all is well.
 
Mike

You are going to be so very mad at me, but I have lost my ATM card.  Can you cancel my card.  I think this proves that I am no allowed to have an ATM card in the future.  Call me.

Q,

I saw you called what do you need?  I'm in a class and can call at break if
you need to talk, otherwise email me.

Kim

It's been canceled.  There were no unauthorized withdrawals.  It very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home, but I didn't want to take any chances.  It's inactivated & I'll have to go to the local branch if I want a new ATM card with non-debit features.  The automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features.

Q,

We may end early today (about 1:00 or 2:00).  I can address it then.  When
did you lose it?  Thank God it is not a Debit Card.

Kim

Fantastic.  Is Sheila planning to attend?  If so then, there are already 8 tickets committed.  If any of these cancel, I have a back-up list.

I will take 2 seats.  Please give me the invites for those two.  I'll take care of their transport.  They will not need Enron transport.

The following are names that Lynn wanted invited to the Nutcraker:

Dawnell Pace  	NorthWest Pipeline

Janette Aggeguin PNM Gas Services

Julia Clevenger  	US Gas Transportation

Pat Davidson   	Southern CA GAs Corp.

Penny Barry	BP Energy

Stephanie Miller	ENA

Thanks,
Ava

Still working...for today anyway. We spent a cold weekend in Conroe TX.  Alina was well-behaved all weekend.  

Can you do lunch this week?  Perhaps tomorrow?

Just checking to see if this e-mail is working. I hope you had a nice
weekend!

Okay with me

Shelley,
Please see the note below.  I recommend taking all the company numbers back to the original plan and any reduction that occurs during the year be viewed as a current estimate.  What are your thoughts?
Donna 

Donna,
In a Dynegy meeting this afternoon, we were instructed to change the Gas Logistics Dynegy Plan -- which we had submitted at $6.363M --
back to the Original Plan of $6.864M.  They viewed the reduction as more of a Current Estimate, so from this point, we will use the $6.864M as the official plan number for future comparisons.  (At least for Dynegy purposes.)
I will resubmit the plan to Steve Kleb this afternoon.   Please inform Shelley about this latest development.
Thanks,

Nancy
 << File: Dynegy Plan 2002 FINAL!!.xls >> 

Caroline,

I'll have to do this by phone with you.  Chad is sick.  Kim stayed home this AM, but I'm planning to work from home this afternoon.

Mr. Chad is sick today with a 102 fever.  Kim stayed home this AM, but I have to relieve him and work from home this PM...so I need to reschedule lunch.  I really need to talk to you though.  Could you go for coffee or a quick dinner this evening on your way home assuming John is headed to Kingwood?

We'll have a brief meeting at nine
Are you listening to the commission hearings today?  Need to know if you want to start your staff meeting @ 9:00 or 10:00.

Thank you, Ricki

Unfortunately I didn't write down the name of the person in payroll that returned my call to the main payroll number.   Whoever it was logged into their system and said that the record showed you making the co. change.  Could you give payroll a call?

Shelley,

I have checked the system and find that the only changes made to your record during 2001 are as follows:

1/1/2001 - 4/15/2001 - VP Reg & Gov. Affairs - Co. 0366
4/15/2001 - 12/16/2001 - Title change to VP Gas Logistics - no company change
12/17/2001 - 12/31/2001 - FMLA Leave - no company change

1/1/2002 - to present company change to 179E.

I have nothing indicating a company change for 2001.  

Let me know who in payroll you spoke with and maybe I can work with them to determine their conclusion.

Rita

Shelly,

As soon as SAP is back up, I will look to see what the changes made to your record were.   I'm thinking your Tax company is Corp and that perhaps you are listed as deferred comp.  That's just off the top of my head.  Again, once the system is operating again, I will check into this.

Rita

Rita,

I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year.  Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.  Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?

Steve/Karen,

I need for Mike to carry a Blackberry.  Please advise on how to make this happy for Mike.

Shelley Corman
VP Gas Logistics 

If you would like me to have one -- i would prefer not to have to ask Steve Hotte and Rod H for approval.

Dannis and Mike,

Due to Financial constraints in November and December, all orders were cancelled.  Therefore to reorder, I would need for you to send me an email with your SAP Coding, Business Purpose and Manager Approval.

I then take that information and have to get IT Director approval, VP approval, CIO approval and CFO approval - This is still in force and to replace your order, please send me the email.

Thanks, Karon

FYI
Shelley - The final version is about 3/4s of an inch thick and there is only possibly a single paper version.   A copy was made this morning by George Kneisley in Roswell who headed up our sub-committee.  He is sending it overnight to Ricki Winters to give to you.   This is a much better document than the electronic copy I sent you earlier.   It was put together for Phil Lowery.

Tks - Mike W.

Shelley,  here is a copy of the UAF sub-committee findings and recommendations.   This is the committee I was on for a year.    I really believe this is a good document with a lot of valuable data but it is very large.   MIPS was the GMS system when this was written so many of the reports were MIPs generated.     They are working on reports for PGAS using "Business Objects" and Jodie and I will be receiving some one on one training tomorrow afternoon. 

Tks - Mike W.

Mike, all I have in electronic format is the UAF portion of the report. I couldn't find anything on PPA's.

Sorry - but it looks like you'll soon be saddled with a Blackberry
We'll take care of all of the approvals and will make this request happen.

Karon will get with Mike on the correct cost center information.

I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.  We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe.  They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  Don't worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).
 
We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.  I'm really just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute.
 
 
 

Of course, that will be OK.  I'll need to find another helper so we have 3.  Will Kim be there?  If not, maybe I can enlist my husband. 
Will you be at 8:30 service?  If so I can get the CD from you then.  I really need to buy a CD player - maybe I can do that by Saturday so we don't have to pass yours back and forth.  I'll let you know if I'm successful. 
Thanks for the attendance numbers - I'll call Jackie tomorrow. 
Barbara 

Mr. Chad is still sick today, but he much appreciated the bear.

I'll have my cell phone with me too.  We will be back on Fri. Mar 15.

Please look at your calendar to see if one of the following dates would suit for our shopping excursion:  April 4 or 5, 10, or 11.

FYI - Alina had her first MMR vaccination back in Jan and will have her followup in early April.  She purportedly already had all her MMR vaccinations in the orphanage but I am repeating just to be certain.

I've got an attic full of stuff for you and many, many Saturday's full of wisdom (and humility).  

I sure enjoyed dinner last night -- ice tea and all. For what it is worth, I
believe you made the right choice, recognizing it was not an easy one. Your
judgment is sound and you should believe in it. I hope you are feeling more
confident in your choice now.

Thanks for your words of wisdom to me. I am admittedly a bit scared -- since
I cannot control this situation very much. 

Just how did we get to be so Type A?

Have a wonderful trip. I will have my cell phone with me if you need to
reach me -- 713-557-8667. Also, the contact information for our condo in
Jackson Hole is Jackson Hole Racquet Club at the Aspens, 307-739-9050 (main
reservations number).

Take care, C

Thanks I found this too.  

According to the Certificate changes, which are filed with the state of Delaware, Article VII, Section 1 was deleted in its entirety and replaced.  The replacement language is consistent with the latest copy that I gave you earlier today.

In this same filing, a change was made to Article V, Section 6.  It states that the determination of how to fund a budget deficit will be made via a super majority vote of the Board.  The language is:

Section 6. A vote of at least seventy-five percent (75%) from the Board, including an
affirmative vote of at least forty percent (40%) from the Directors representing each Segment
within each Quadrant, shall be required to determine how to fund a budget deficit or to
establish or modify a promotional dues program.

The filing is dated August 3, 1998.

Jim
 
I would be happy to do my usual Spring bedding flower planting, but I will be out of town on our Spring break trip on Sat.  Mar 9.  Please advise on whether you/the trustees would like me to add some new bedding plants around the trees, memorial and church entrance the following weekend on Mar 15.   
 
 
Reminder!!!
Saturday, March 9, 2002    8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.
All-Church Work Day
Come and help beautify the church for Easter.

I am looking to schedule a Vacation Bible School Training Meeting.  I am wondering whether there are any conflicts on the church calendar if I schedule this meeting for May 5, 12-2?

I'm back.  I was gone all of two minutes.  I needed a bathroom break.  I figured out that the straw was simply the 2 or 3 issue and so I didn't bother to chime in when I returned.

Ricki may tell you that the Board was voting while you were out of the room.  IT WAS ONLY A STRAW COUNT for support of three voting members at a promotional rate.  It was not a real vote and we've moved on.  Boswell is taking the issues one at a time to determine support each -- an attempt to move us forward.

TH

Sorry but I'm hostage in. Meeting in 39c1.  I'll catch up wti you tomorrow.

Chris,

I was about to send off the info from the prior email when I received your latest update.  However, I'm confused by the update.  The form seems to be the same, except it is intended to be sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York.  Is that really where we are sending our registration information?  What about the autobiography.  What is that, What is required?  

I understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today.  But, frankly this whole process was a surprise to me.  Does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general.  I'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next.  When to apply for SS#.  What about readoption.  Passport, Certificate of Citizenship, etc.  I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived.

I need to take care of the registration issue today, as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week.  

Shelley Corman
713-853-7083

 

Dear Families,
Rod Archer gave me a better place for you to download the Registration form 
for the Embassy. When you get to the page go to #4 and you can download the 
Form so that it is easy to read and print.Thanks again.

Thanks.

I won't be home until 6.  Have meeting ,. Will call when I leave

Let it rip

Dates all work great.  As you mentioned, I will likely be traveling in late November or early December

You probably noticed that I will be out this Friday for the Mylogram.  This outpatient procedure will determine if I will require surgery on my neck to remove the bone spurs that are pinching nerves.

November 5th - 7th I will be on vacation in Phoenix.

November 14th Jury Duty that I rescheduled from July.

Still working on the holidays and at the moment I'm trying to stay here for Thanksgiving and out the week of Christmas.  I'm purposely scheduling this so I will be here while your out of the country, so please let me know if things change.

Will these dates work for you?

Thank you, Ricki

John - please drop Mike a line about the Contracts system implementation on TW on Monday AM as Mike is attending Stan's staff meeting for me.

Shelley,
 A reminder notice was posted today for TW customers about the implementation of the new CMS/Capacity Release system this weekend. 
Just wanted to let you know that I was going to come in the office Sunday morning as back up for the TW group just in case there were any issues from the implementation of the CMS/Capacity Release system. 
Ramona, Linda Trevino and their team will also be in the office Sunday morning for support.

John Buchanan

	Shelley attached is the latest on the calendar and procedures.  I am still working on
	both, but wanted to get something to you.  Let me know if I am way off base with what
	you are looking for.  We'll keep trying to refine the document into procedures. Thanks. Lynn

 

    

 

I don't plan for us to sign on, we'll just wait for it to hit the board for vote.

Great.  Thanks!

Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule. -- but 8 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas.  I think we should plan to manually handle any pre 1997 ppas that we feel bound to accept.

FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday!

Florida is great.  We have been on the go all day and its been after business hours when I've gotten back to the house so I didn't get to talk to you.  But I have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week.  And we can send out an email on our staff meeting on Monday.

Disney was great and I've been to 8 baseball games. Today we're going to an Astros practice and then we catch our flight home.

See you Monday

See you soon!

I can either plant this Sat or next.  If you guys already mulched last week, then I can manage the planting on my own.  If not, I could use help with mulching the beds before I plant.

Have a great trip.  I'll be thinking of you.

Call me when you get to the office.  I have been thinking of you constantly this last week and am anxious to hear your voice.

Have a great week back at the office.

No, we live about 2-3 mi. off I-10.  It is really easy to get to our house from Austin by taking 71 to I-10 east. 

Here is a turn by turn:

Exit 1-10 at Highway 6 (17 mi. West of Downtown Houston).  

Go South on Hwy 6 to the 3rd stop light (Chevron station on SE corner).  Take right onto Briarforest Drive.  Take first left onto Briarhome (Meadowbriar subdivision).  We live on Scarborough Fair -- third street off Briarhome.  Our home is 2-story red brick & is in the NE corner.

14126 Scarborough Fair
Houston TX 77077
281-531-0385

Also last night I emailed Sergei a brief note regarding what Ginger was telling us yesterday. I didn't want to jump ranks or push him for an earlier date -- but I wanted to make certain that he knew that all our paperwork is in. 

Shelley,
That sounds good. Fred and Marisa may go to the zoo. Do you live off of 290? 
That is the way we usually come.

Liz

Jeffri,

I have received the revised W-2 forms from Enron that increases my reported income to reflect my non-eligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts.  (See letter in the package of information that I previously delivered to you).  Evidently Enron failed the test for providing dependent day care benefits to highly compensated employees.  I will fedex the revised W-2 forms to you.

I would like to set up a date (perhaps over the lunch hour one day) to meet at your office to review my return and to discuss alternatives for the second home (either rental or sale to my mother and/or her fianc?).

Shelley Corman
713-853-7083
shelley.corman@enron.com

I'm fine with not having Children's Church Palm Sunday -- recognizing that we won't have CC for 3 weeks then.  I'll adjust the curriculum notes accordingly and we'll pick up with Children's Church on April 14.

Shelley:
Read Patty's comments, and I will call you in the next day or two to discuss.
Thanks,
Barbara

Please let me know if there is a time in the day that you would like me to meet with or great your TECO guests.

Yes,  I volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year.  I was planning to pick up some flowers early Sat. morning at plant at the church.  If you want to meet me there around 8:30 AM or so that would be great (but please don't feel obligated).  I think we could get the planting done in about an hour.

Congrats to you on your recent wedding.  I am so thrilled for you both.

Hello Shelly,

Jim Keesling advised you were going to replant the flower bed by the
Sanctuary entrance. I mulched it last week and was going to do something
this week or  Saturday latest.

Please let me know if you need help in any way.

Thanks/Regards

FYI Regarding Mn EC Closing.

I really enjoyed our talk last night.  You gave me some really good advice.  

I'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about, but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the Hill Country Hyatt some weekend.  I think Alina would love the water rafting.  We could go the weekends of May 11, 18 or 25 if you are interested.

Talk to you soon.  Chad really, really wants to have Tom come over to play soon!

Dear Alumns,

I'm sorry to have to convey the bad news that the Penn State 
administration has decided to close the Department of Energy, 
Environmental, and Mineral Economics effective July 1.   This 
decision stems primarily from massive budget cuts confronting the 
University in light of a significant decrease in state appropriations 
and of a continuation of increasing costs of higher education.  Also, 
despite acknowledged progress in Department accomplishments, we are 
still lagging other EMS departments in major areas such as student 
credit hours and external funding.  Finally, it is easier to close a 
small Department, and one that is sometimes (and erroneously) viewed 
as duplicating educational efforts in the economics area, than it is 
to close a larger and more unique department in the College.

Fortunately, the University is formulating a plan with many positive 
aspects for our faculty, staff, students, and with respect to 
coverage of our fields of expertise.  Tenured faculty will be 
shifting their appointments to other units in the College 
(Meteorology, Geography) and elsewhere at Penn State (Business, Ag 
Econ).  The staff has been promised at least equivalent opportunities 
in EMS.  Continuing students will be provided the necessary courses 
over the next two years to graduate.  New educational initiatives in 
Environmental Risk Management and in Energy Business, and new 
research initiatives associated with Penn State's new Environmental 
Consortium will also serve to continue our intellectual tradition.

Still, there is no way of getting around the news that a wonderful 
educational entity that has been home to so many wonderful people and 
has contributed so much to education, the State of Pennsylvania, and 
the larger world community, will soon cease to exist.  Please know 
that our Department has worked valiantly for many years to amass 
accomplishments that would stave off such a decision.  As Head of the 
Department over the past fourteen years, however, I feel that I bear 
the ultimate responsibility for this outcome.  I only wish that I 
could have done more.

I regret that I have not kept in better touch with many of our 
alumns.  Recently, and facilitated by the ease of using e-mail, we 
had planned to start a semi-annual Alumni Newsletter.  The current 
situation actually makes this even more imperative-the Department may 
no longer exist but our Alumni Association can prosper indefinitely 
if we participate actively in it.  Let me encourage you to spread the 
word about our situation to alumns who have not received this 
communication and to ask them to send me their e-mail addresses for 
future communications.

A degree from Penn State's Mineral Economics Department, or the 
revamped Department of Energy, Environmental, and Mineral Economics, 
has served our alumns especially well over the past five decades. 
There is no reason that it should not continue to do so.

Thanks,

Adam Rose
Professor and Head

Please plan to get together tomorrow, March 20 from 3-4 PM in 39C1 for a staff meeting.  We can talk about the new Enron severance policy, the return of the personal best award program or anything else that is on your mind.  If you have issues that you know that you would like me to address please drop me an email today so that I can do some research and be better prepared to answer your questions.

OCC has called me and I am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that I no longer cover communications so I have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate.

Summary notes from Tom Mertz
-There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility.  
- Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications.
- The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore.
- Going to do fly over.
- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard. Coast Guard will meet us at site. 
- We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup
-There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.

MOTION TO INTERVENE
The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines.
2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines.
The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest.
III.
COMMENTS
            The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.
            Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.   
            Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.  
            For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

 
 
 
December 8, 2000
 
Re:            Business Practices Subcommittee Priority Action Items 1 and 2 and R00026 
 
 
At the scheduled December 14, 2000 GISB Executive Committee meeting, the agenda includes a discussion and vote on Recommendations and Proposed Standards.  This agenda item contains certain BPS proposals related to implementation of Order No. 637 requirements and related standards such as R00026.   Among the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and recalls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove current GISB restrictions against partial-day recalls. 
 
Our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not fully address the far-reaching impact of flowing day recalls.  There are significant operational concerns with these standards.  We are concerned about whether the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled party does not continue to flow, particularly during critical periods.  We are concerned about whether current GISB communication time frames are adequate for handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid.   The proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern - whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled.  This does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid.  
 
Given these operational concerns, we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards.  While we understand that this work is in response to R00026, we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No. 637.   Order No. 637 requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity.  There are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper. Very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day.   Further, most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability. 
 
In the spirit of compromise, we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases.  However, under these revised standards, all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business Days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported.  Nonetheless, throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach, the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards.  
 
Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards, the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards.  In this area, we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the Evening Nomination Cycle.  This allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow.  While this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls, it still preserves the application of the full-day contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers.  Flowing day recalls, though, are a separate issue.  Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems, overruns, imbalances and increased occurrences of Operational Flow Orders.  Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls, pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards. 
 
Any move from daily increments of service to partial-day increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system, including firm services, interruptible services, and balancing and operational provisions. Because these developments involve changes to tariffs and customers service offerings, this is not an area that is currently ripe for GISB development.
 
The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts identified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to the BPS recommendation.

Also enclosed are three extra copies to be file-stamped and returned to the messenger.  These comments have also been submitted electronically through the Internet e-mail.
 
Very truly yours,
 
 
 
Shelley A. Corman, Vice President
Enron Transportation Services Company
 
For the Enron Interstate Pipelines
 
 

Jennifer,

Regrettably I will not be able to attend the April 19 meeting of the dinner.  Please pass my best wishes on to both Dean Dutton and Professor Kleit for a successful meeting.

The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.

There are three main principles behind the current rules:
1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate
2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and
3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.

There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.

So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.

Shelley, dumb question, but I'm thinking in terms of general synergies for reorgco.  I am familiar with restrictions that prohibit operating info and preferential treatment to marketing affiliates of pipeline co's, but do the regulated pipeline co's have unrestricted access to the info from marketing affiliates?  My guess would be that the rule is asymmetric, but Enron always seemed to treat it as a two-way street.
Thx-
Davis

New rules propose to:
1. Expand the list of who is a marketing affiliate
2. Require pipeline to keep detailed records of communications with affiliates 

Great, thanks - that gets to the heart of it.  I suppose that with respect to planning, separateness would apply.  Out of curiosity, are the changes going to be more restrictive or less?

Thanks, I needed a little bedtime reading!

Shelley:
Thanks for your comments - we got an extra day to work through these so your timing was good.  I have attached the revised business plan that incorporates more formatting changes than anything else.  I will incorporate your changes in the next turnaround along with the Batchelder comments, due tomorrow.  Thanks for your assistance on this.

Kevin

ps - Thanks for lunch yesterday.

 << File: NNG Revised Bus Plan 31902.doc >> 

No material impact .  The filing concerns various scheduling and balancing rules.

Ricki - I don't yet have answers back to many of the questions that I pitched to HR and Lynn and Donna are out -- so could you see about the possibility of moving our staff meeting to tomorrow afternoon?

Hi Bev,

Just checking in.  What is the latest on your travel time frame?  Hope everything is moving quickly ahead for you.

Shelley

Or are you still swamped from being out of the office.

Let me know how your Drs appt goes.  I'll have to let you know later about Fri.  -- got some scheduling things up in the air.

I'd love to go but an at the doctor's office now and then have a March of
Dimes lunch for our Baylor team captains. How about Friday?

Let me know what you think about April 12 as a possible San Marcos date.  Second choice would be April 5.

I signed up for the class today.  I live on the far west side of town (just S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in time on Sat. Nov 3.  

Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Austin.   I'll give you better directions later.

Chad has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very early.  I can drive to the conference so that your husband can have the car for a day of sightseeing.

I have another meeting at 3.  I'll join you late if I can.  I'm just finishing up my comments on the NNG business plan and will forward shortly.

This morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/Rob the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.  These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.  Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us.

Shelley:
We are having a meeting in 49C2 at 3:00 regarding the TW/NNG deal with Jerry Peters at Border. If you are available, please feel free to join us.
Kevin

Great

Thanks.

I talked with Maria re: who signs TPAs for NNG.  TPAs should be signed by an officer of NNG.  We can prepare the document (i.e., fill in the blanks), but not sign.  I'm working out the details of the process and will forward to you, Mary Draemer, Brad, etc.

The agreements look great.  Thanks for your efforts.

Are you interested in getting a group of people together to buy 4 tickets (est. cost $10,000)?  Would need to be split 10 ways to be doable?

Houston Astros Baseball season tickets are available sale to employees at their face value.  The seats range in price from $2,490 to $3,237 for the season, and are located in the box and club levels. 

If you're interested in being on the list of potential buyers for Enron's season tickets to the Astro's 2002 home games, please indicate your interest by 4PM, Central Time on Thursday, March 21 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you're interested in purchasing for the full season (no partial season or individual games).  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined, we'll know whether a lottery process will need to take place to fairly allocate the purchase opportunities and will communicate that to respondents.

Please note that the season begins on Friday, March 29 so payment for the tickets will need to be made early next week. 

If you have any questions, please call Elizabeth Linnell at x33896 or Rachel Tobor at x31481.

Here's my first stab

Key Findings
1. With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process.  The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close
2.  The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through
3.  There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process.  Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF.
4.  The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing.

Recommendations

1. Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations  (Gas Logistics).
2. Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters.
3. Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close.
4. Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist.

I can make that work for Chad if that is when Drew is available.  I assume you are talking about Wk of June 24?  

I agree with your strategy

Shelley,

FYI

A GISB ratification ballot has been distributed.  One item is the 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas'.  We did not participate in this effort because it doesn't affect us.

I voted in favor of it at the last EC meeting and plan to support it on the ratification ballot.  Richard Smith of ExxonMobil wants this item to be approved.  He's been very instrumental in getting our Order 637 transactional reporting issues pushed through GISB.  The transactional reporting data sets (EBB usage only) will be voted at the next EC meeting in April.  We may need his support.  Therefore, I'm supporting him on the base contract.

Ratification is due April 19.  I'll route and submit ballot as usual

Thanks,
Theresa

How about Monday?

Shelley,

Congratulations!  TW has a great marketing department and I know that you will enjoy working with everyone.  Can we schedule lunch next week?  I would love to visit with you and share with you some of the things we have been working on to ensure a smooth transition.  I am available on Monday, Wednesday or Friday.  Tuesday is possible, I would need to move another appointment.

Thanks, Kim.

Thanks of your words of encouragement.  

Let me point out, this is NOT sucking up.  

However, congratulations on your new endeavor.

I know it's too early to consider, but in the future, if you decide there is a position available in your new group, please consider me.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not unhappy where I am, just seeking opportunities to expand.

I bring 28 years experience in a variety of areas both in TW and NNG including Contracts, Scheduling, and Gas Control.

Again congratulations and good luck.

Dear Mr. _____________,
 
By prior correspondence dated ______, we notified you that we  you were notified of Ashford United Methodist Church's concern over the proEarlier this year AMaintenance of Houston currently provides janitorial service to Ashford United Methodist Church and Ashford Child Enrichment Center under a month to month contract.   Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.
 
In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.  We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.  We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.
 
It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.  It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.
 
Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.  To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.
 
 
 
 
Sincerely

Great.  I'll put 11:30 on my calendar.

How about Monday?

Shelley,

Thanks, Kim.

Shellley would like to meet at 9:30 on Monday in her office to discuss Transwestern customer accounts.  Please let me know if you have a conflict with this time.

Thanks,
Lindy

Teb - would you have time to brainstorm with me on some middle of the road rate treatment scenarios on Monday?

Rod:
For purposes of using an LLC in the model, is there some level of value that we think we can keep relative to the tax allowance?  I don't think assuming that you give away 100% of the value you derive from not paying taxes at the LLC level +  still having to deduct your ADIT from rate base makes a lot of sense.  There should be some middle point here.  I could be wrong however.  The reason I ask is that if we assume both TW and NNG are C-Corps and we need to make the earnings per common unit accretive (leaving aside the fact that the CASH distritbution per unit is very accretive), this may not work.  Shelley, any help would be appreciated.
Kevin

Stan told me that you were using that title too.  So I guess perhaps I negotiated another thing as well.  Seriously though I would like to talk to you about using common titles.
Well, how does it feel to be MD and CCO of TW?  Glad you decided to stay..................have a good weekend.
                                                                                                    Bob
Did you get in touch with TK?  How did you negotiate the chief comm title?  I'm impressed.  You did more in a day, than I did in several years!!!!!!!!!!!!

Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise.  Here is the short version.  Yes I have a new job.  But, surprise, it's still at Enron.  I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future.

We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.  The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.  On the other hand we could just relax pool side.  We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.  Just let me know your leisure preferences.  

Hi. How was your weekend? I hope you had a nice visit with your guests. 

As you can imagine I spent most of the weekend caring for John. He actually
slept quite a bit on Saturday but I thought I should stick around in case he
needed something. Yesterday, he started to get a little more mobile but it
is going to be a while before he is "back on his feet." He did go to work
today and starts physical therapy today as well.

I hope to see you all sometime soon. What are your plans for Easter?

I am going to be available in a few minutes

Okay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before us.  That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.  Sergei is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.    

I am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15. On that date my nanny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for Chad at home.  Wow this waiting is stressful.

Based on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.  Kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home to tend to Chad & his obligations.   We definitely don't want to leave Alina to come with an escort.  But, the issue we still need to work through is the fact that Alina is still scared o Kim.

Ginger,
I was able to get Ginger on her cell phone. She said, that we were the first 
to go in, that the other group was a different region, and that they had to 
go in order and that their paper work was in before ours. She said she was 
not sure what Chris had told me, but would get with her about it when she 
gets back. I do NOT like it all, but will try to give them the benefit of the 
doubt that this is the best that can be done.

I also asked about the 2 weeks prior to court date, and the 2 weeks after 
court date, and she said as of now only the 2 weeks prior is being waived, 
but that Sergei is still working on it and will not have the answer until he 
has our court date and papers.
I also asked (again) about only 1 parent travelling and she said that to her 
knowledge there has been no law change to allow that, and I asked (again) 
what about a waiver or something and she did say they have been asking that 
question of Kazakhstan but no answer yet.

There is the option of having your child escorted back by future family, 
Ginger didn't think I would want to do that, and she is right, but I guess it 
is an option.

Well, at least we for sure will be able to do the conference.

Liz

I don't plan to attend the NNG customer accts meeting

Should I free up this time on your calendar?

Thanks, Ricki

I moved this meeting date to avoid potential conflicts with people being out the office on Good Friday.  Dynegy will be represented in this meeting so please come prepared to explain any issues or variances.

Just wanted to say congratulations on the change to TW Marketing.
If I can help in anyway, please call.
Dan

Sorry for the unfriendly greeting in the lobby.  I just had my head in the clouds.  Have a great evening!

I am avialable tomorrow afternoon.  Will 2 PM ET work for you?  Will you call me or should I call you?

Liz,

I spoke with Ginger today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.  She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation.  She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.   

This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.  

I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.  What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.

Shelley

We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.  The kids were pretty wild.  It wasn't one of our better days.  Oh well!
 
If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?
 
Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there).

Hi Shelley: 
I hope all went well on Sunday.  One thing I forgot was to ask you or Elizabeth to take a count of children/adults attending Children's Church and get it to Jackie in the office.  If you want to email the info to me, I will be happy to call Jackie.   
Take care, 
Barbara 
P.S.  Will you be there next Sunday to handle music? 

I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff.  Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on Royal Oaks.  Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.  Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.  I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses.

 I now  have another meeting over the lunch hour.  Perhaps another day this week?  
Shelley:  

Are you available for lunch today?  Your calendar shows you are open at 12:00. 

Brad

Rick,

When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with Keith Higginbotham).  I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ Sharon for several weeks.  I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.   What is your team working on on Gulfstream?

Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.  I think I had the outdated  one prior to the latest printing.

Thanks

Shelley

If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity. We would disclose entities above TW in the corp chain for informational purposes.  FERC is interested for two reasons - to understnad that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW,s capital structure and return in a rate case.  !

We received our INS approval today and will overnight thr notarized version to Ginger Monday.  So it is all in Ginger's hands now.                            Shelley

Thanks for taking the lead on this

Please set something up
Shelly:

Don Hawkins and Sarabeth Smith would like to get together with you to discuss the Citizens deal and how things are going for you and your group with the business that is being generated by EAMR.

Don will be traveling starting Tuesday, Oct. 23 through November 1st.  Therefore, they would like to set up the meeting sometime Monday, Oct. 22  afternoon - anytime from 1:30 - 4 (however, he has a meeting starting at 4pm - so would have to conclude by then).

Please let me know if you can do this on the 22nd.  Thank you!

I am getting home early. We are supposed to land at 3 pm.  Love you .

Great.  I am getting back early around 4.30.  We will meet you at 6.30 even if  John is late we can have wine and catch up.

Whqt interview?

I am out of town on business tonight.  I saw you called but thought it is probably too late to reply.  Yes I would like to attend the conference and would love to get together while you are in town.  I will give you a call tomorrow night when I get back to town.  I didn't hear from Ginger this week.  I did talk to Connie the travel broker and she said that she was just holding our visa stuff pending instructions from Chris Ivins.  Suzanne emailed me that Randi Thompson the head of Kidsave is in Kazakstan right now and will be sending out an email to the Kidsave families.  Regards.  Shelley

I am out of town on business.  Are you interested in dinner tomorrow night at cafe express?  On Sat Chad has a 3 pm soccer game and at 5.30 birthday party.  We can work around these plans if you prefer.

Are you going to apply?

 Fuel is retained in kind from the shippers.   

Ok

Great! I will review them on Monday no need to send to FL.

Great

Now I'm back at my desk.  I think we've finally found the right tool for you to stay constantly in touch with me.

This is sooooo Cool!!!!!!! 

Thanks 

I agree since I am at the bank right now

Thanks

Here is my mark-up.  Please make sure that it is factually correct. 

 

Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the letter concerning the reinstatement of the old scheduled quantities report.  

Jim

			 << File: CustomerLetterSchdQtyReports10-17-01.doc >> 

I think it sounds worthwhile -- since Linda Breathitt and Stacy Girard are participating.  If Stan is unavailable, I think Phil Lowry or Mike Nelson would also be great choices.
Stan's been invited to present at a broadcast that SGA is hosting.  Apparently, Jerry Halverson indicated to this organization that Stan would be a great person to represent the industry.  Would you both take a look at the agenda for the broadcast and let me know if you think this is something that Stan should participate in?

If it is something that you think is worthwhile, I would work with INGAA on exactly what message they want Stan to communicate.

Thanks for your insight.

Can I get your opinion by Thursday?

Gina

Gina,
Attached are two informational pieces regarding the November 1 Broadcast as
well as a registration form.  Hope you can join us.

Sherry called Kim the other night to see if he would run for the HOA.  Surely there must be more to this.  Why wouldn't the HOA pay their bills?   I'll have to ask Joe Carrabba tonight.

I thought this might interest you.

For SLA file
The attachment is the latest proposal for the SLA and Carlton resolution.   Shelley, as you can see the timing on the in kind is now 11/1/02.  However, you also note there is no consequence when we aren't able to accomplish.   MK
The customers asked that we send them our 7/17 offer in writing.  Here is a draft for your review.  The .xls spreadsheet shows the calculation of the 6/1/01 adjustment amount for R&T and the credit to the SLA.

We'd like to send this out to the customers this afternoon.  Please give me any comments you have by 3:00 today.  sjk

  

Please add Suzanne Hoffman to my contact list -- Her email address is twhiteman@austin.rr.com <mailto:twhiteman@austin.rr.com>
Shelley,
 
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
 
Sorry for the delay. 
 
Suzanne  
 
 
Dear Suzanne, 
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please 
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite 
102, 
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in 
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital 
section. 
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned 
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is 
the 
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to 
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is 
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that 
"the 
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would 
be 
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian 
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a 
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan. 
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any 
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to 
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a 
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends 
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything 
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me. 
Chris

I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part where he copied Stan.

This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to Phil's staff.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold" on my seriousness.  Evidentally there was some issue......

 

Shelley . . . 

Looking over my notes from the Operations Directors Conference, I am reminded of what a fine job you did delivering your presentation and I thought I'd provide you this feedback.

I felt you clearly conveyed your information in a manner that engaged the participants and helped them understand and retain your message.  Specifically, you organized your presentation in a logical sequence, you spoke distinctly with varying voice inflection and without "umms" (a very difficult thing to do!), and you related well to your audience through a friendly tone in your voice and in your body language (smiles, eye contact and open posture).  Watching and listening, I both "liked" you and felt "sold" on the seriousness of you and your group in executing the duties of your function and providing effective customer service.

To improve the effectiveness of your slide show, you might consider reducing the number of bullets in some slides.  As a general rule, slides become "busy" and impact the receiver's comprehension when the number of bullets gets past about six; so, I suggest that you limit the number of bullets in any one slide to 5 or 6 and break up a list any longer than that into two or more slides.  This will make your audience more comfortable and enhance their retention.

Thanks for the effort and energy you put into your session.  I learned helpful new things about gas logistics and enjoyed your presentation.  You were very effective.

Regards,
- Roger

(Note to Stan - I had to step out while you were speaking; so, please don't expect this level of feedback on your presentation, though I'm sure it went just as well!)

FYI -- NERC is expanding their role to include development of wholesale electric business practice standards, in addition to reliability standards.  It looks like they're making it clear that they don't want an EISB developing wholesale electric standards.  They plan to be the single organization for developing these standards.  They've even added balanced voting for their committees.  I don't know the details, but they're using pieces of GISB's process that they know work and that people like.

Some GISB representatives have been making it look as if everyone in the energy industry is on board with EISB.  Clearly, they're not.

I'll let you know if I hear anything else.

NERC Expands Role

At a watershed meeting today in Vancouver, BC, the North American Electric
Reliability Council's (NERC) Board of Trustees took bold steps to expand
its
role for developing standards for the wholesale electric industry in North
America.

Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, said, "On the strength of strong
recommendations from the NERC Stakeholders Committee, the Board pledged to
take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America
to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business
practice standards and to file such standards with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) and appropriate government agencies in
Canada."

"NERC is committed," says Gent, "to establishing a fair, open, balanced,
and
inclusive process for developing all standards."  NERC's Board approved a
new process for developing standards and agreed to a new composition and
weighted sector voting model for its standing committees.

NERC has long been recognized and respected as the industry's developer of
standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected
transmission systems throughout North America.  These standards have been
the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems for over
30 years.

Richard Drouin, Chairman of NERC, stated, "The Board of Trustees recognizes
the urgent need for a single organization to develop both reliability
standards and wholesale electric business practice standards that are well
coordinated.  Such standards," Drouin added, "are vital to support the
evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large
regional transmission organizations, and continued reliability and security
of interconnected transmission systems."

Today's actions are a major step toward formalizing a role that NERC has
filled for some time.  NERC spearheaded the OASIS "What" and "How" Working
Groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed
by
all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee to address
the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market
practices on reliability; and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling
Collaborative, which recently filed a report with FERC on its efforts to
develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS
Phase II).

To accomplish its reinvention, NERC will actively solicit support from
Canadian and U.S. government entities, and facilitate ? jointly with
interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators;
and other stakeholder organizations ? an open and inclusive process to
achieve consensus on the details of its new role.

In parallel actions, the Board also took steps to ensure the independence
of
actions by its 21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail
merchant functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting
structure of its standing committees.

For more information on NERC or its transformation into NAERO, visit NERC's
web site (http://www.nerc.com/). The web site also includes information on
the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for
virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada, and a
portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

>>...here is the State Dept's Foreign travel requirements section for 
Kaz, showing a different HIV requirement!<<

Any idea what the Russian laws are with respect to HIV testing?  We 
were not asked to show proof of HIV testing to obtain Kaz visas or 
anytime (to our knowledge) that we were in Kaz.  However, we were 
asked by the consular staff at the Russian Embassy in DC to show proof 
before they would issue our visas.  It took three trips to the Russian 
Embassy to get our visas -- so it's possible the guy was just giving 
me the run-around -- but I'd be curious to know what the law says 
since Kaz families must return via Moscow.

A new thread on accomodations in Kazakhstan was proposed by one of our

apartment or staying in a hotel.  If you've already traveled to Kaz --

We stayed in a hotel during our stay in our son's adoption city and 
then had an apartment during our stay in Almaty.  We personally loved 
having an apartment - it was "our time" with our son - we were able 
to start being a family and doing family things - playing, cooking, 
cleaning, etc.  Our life began together immediately - I think (and I 
don't know, since we didn't do this) if you were with a host family - 
it would put a different twist on the situation.  Not saying good or 
bad - just different.  Kind of like when you visit someone and stay at 
their house vs renting a hotel room.  You can be more "open" when you 
are with your own family.

Best wishes on your adoption journey. :)

I find all of this very interesting.  We traveled in June of this year
and didn't have the HIV test done.  The only thing that we had read was
that we needed the HIV only if we would be there more than 3 months.  No
one ever asked us for the results in Kazakhstan or Russia, thankfully!

I'd like to share the experience we had in Karaganda.  We stayed with a family in a small apartment adjacent to their own apartment.  It was a wonderful way to get our new son used to family life as well as have Russian speakers nearby to ease the transition to living with English-only speakers.

The particular family we stayed with consisted of a grandmother (retired schoolteacher) who was there ALL the time.  Babushka cooked all our meals as well and she and I became close friends even though she spoke only Russian and I only English.  The father was an engineer by training but was currently doing much of the document running necessary for the adoptions processed by our facilitator.  The mother was an ear/nose/throat doctor and there were 2 children (17 year old boy who spoke wonderful English and acted as our translator - for a fee of course - and his 10 year old sister).
    I would encourage anyone who has the option of staying with a family to do so.  It helps to see how families live over there as well as observe first hand how food is served.  They eat the same sorts of food we see all the time here but serve it differently.  That knowledge alone was wonderful to have when our son first came back.  I fixed the food in the manner he was accustomed to seeing it served.  He now eats the way we do (big plates and cooked in our way) and he's been back since 1 March this year.

Hi Everyone!

The tantrums just crack me up because of their similarities.  Of course, that's cuz we havent had one here in a week.  But, it is so typical for our kids to be "set off" by something that seems so simple, and then they end up hating themselves (I call it a "hate fest") and being self abusive.  Karly has told me during her tantrums that she is going to run away or kill herself, and she hits herself too.  How Kaz of her....yet her therapist says she's processing everything well and doesn't need to be seen every week.  But, it still is a worry for the future.....  

Here's a question.  If the kids are tantrumming and abusing themselves, doesn't that show guilt and self hatred?  Even though Kira doesn't feel bad about drinking the soda, doesn't she feel bad for doing a wrong thing?  Is the problem that she doesn't feel bad for hurting and disappointing the family?  Is this just misplaced guilt?

Here is an idea (and it is just an idea) about the conscience thing. The current behavioral theory with "normal" children is to discipline and consequence inappropriate behaviors without expressing anger, so kids don't feel shame or guilt.  So, would a way of teaching guilt include the parent sharing feelings of sadness and disappointment at the behavior?For instance, when Kira is calmed down, or at a later time, can you share your sadness that she lied to you?Can you on a regular basis model different feelings (it is totally hard for me NOT to model anger and frustration).  Just an idea.  

What do the professionals who you all are working say about conscience?    

Shannon, just once in a while, Karly has a positive feeling about her first family (such as when her birth parent bought her koolaid-wow there's a real  great parent, huh).  Anyway, I point at that it's good that at least she has ONE good memory about her, but when she begins sentimentalizing (?!) she is reminded that the nice kool aid lady also left her alone for hours, beat her, screamed at her and cut her with a knife.  This way, I figure she has a balanced perspective....

See you all later,

Denise

I have been trying to check out the requirements for Russian Visa's 
and Kazakhstan Visa's with several of the agencies that assist people 
in getting their visa's.  For both Russia and Kazakhstan, I have only 
found that it is required if you are planning to stay over 3 months.  

I wonder if it once was required for all traveling but is no longer??

My husband and I are discussing the pro's and con's of changing our

to get him into second grade after a few months of english at home, 
home-bonding and home-schooling.  My husband wants to take away the

it, but he, of course, is leaning towards it.  Thoughts anyone?

Since Taraz seems to be the topic of conversation for so many right now, I 
decided to post directly to the list in hopes that I can share our experience.

We adopted our son, now 3 from Taraz in August of 2000 using Kids First/Frank 
Foundation.  

In answer to alot of your questions, We flew through New Yorks JFK to Moscow, 
that flight was 10 hours long and we arrived in Moscow in mid morning and 
were brought to a hotel close to the airport to eat and rest.  Our flight to 
Almaty left at 11pm.  We arrived in Almaty after a 3 hour time difference and 
I believe the flight was about 3 hours as well, so it was about 4am Almaty 
time.  Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our 
coordinator, the sun was just coming up.  We then went to her flat to rest 
some more and eat breakfast.  (Although it seems like we had alot of time to 
rest, it was worth it to lay down as much as possible and relax to help us 
adjust to the time change)  We then went to the bank to get money that had 
been wired to us and then got our tickets for the train ride for that night. 
 I believe we got to the train station about 5pm for the train to leave about 
6pm.  We had our own cabin that had 2 padded benches with clean linens, 
plenty of pillows, a table and a window.  We were able to store our luggage 
under the bences.  The door to our cabin locked from the inside and we felt 
completely safe the entire time.  We took alot of video footage of the towns 
we went through.  There were people that would try to sell stuff at each of 
the stops.  Everything from bottled water to fried chicken.  The bathrooms 
were not the greatest on the train, but when you have to go, you take what 
you can get, although they were better than any port-a-potty I have ever been 
into here in the states.  Although I didn't visit other areas on the train, 
one of the people we were traveling with did and said you will see all sorts 
of people that are in non-private cars, but nobody ever bothered us.

We arrived at the Taraz train station around 4am and were met by the driver 
of the orphanage with his van.  We were brought to our host families flat to 
get settled and then went to the orphanage to meet our son.  Each day we were 
able to visit the bobek for about 3 hours in the morning and 2-3 hours in the 
afternoon.  Our court experience was short and non-eventful.  We were able to 
have dinner with the orphanage director at a restraunt by her flat.  We were 
able to go to the store everyday for bottled,noncarbonated water (and beer 
too)  We also visited the internet cafe which is just down the street from 
the telecom building.  It was very inexpensive.  We ate at a few restraunts 
in Taraz as well and never got sick.  One gentleman got sick from drinking 
some bad vodka, but said it was just like he drank something that didn't 
agree with him, he vomited once and was fine. 

The train ride back to Almaty left about the same time and we had no worries 
with our son.  We made a bed for him on the floor between our benches and he 
slept the entire time.  Another couple I know, made a bed for their infant in 
their small suitcase ontop of their clean clothes so the child wouldn't roll 
around.

One thing I can't express enough was the CHILDRENS CHEWABLE DRAMAMINE!  It is 
perfect and the last thing you want is a vomiting toddler on the plane.  It 
is messy and awful.

Also take lots of pictures!  While putting together my sons scrapbook of our 
journey to get him, I realized I hadn't taken pictures of things that now are 
important.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.

God Bless and good luck.

We gave our youngest a two year "discount" -- which actually puts her in the
50th percentile on weight and height.  We explained it to her as the fact
that she was getting some of the years she spent in the orphanage back.

This was one of the best decisions we made early on.

We held each child back 1 year in school from their American age 
peers, but did NOT change their actual birthdates.

Initially, I felt strongly that we should change their birthdates by 
1 year -- but Jackson felt VERY strongly that we should not.  His 
logic was that after we opted to change their Russian and Kazak 
names -- the only "thing" they brought with them from Kaz was their 
birthdates.

The school district initially placed a GREAT deal of pressure on us 
to place them with their age peers, but we resisted and basically 
demanded that they be placed back 1 year -- which was within our 
rights to do -- although the school district tried to convince us 
otherwise.  They kept telling us that ESL would catch the kids up 
soon enough -- but given the fact that neither child had much formal 
education, we didn't feel starting them in 2nd and 4th grade was in 
their best interest.

So, although our kids were 8 and 10 years old when they came home in 
April of 2000, we started them off in 1st and 3rd grade.  The kids 
then attended 1st and 3rd grade summer school -- and we moved them on 
to 2nd and 4th grade in September 2000, just over 4 months after they 
came home.  

Academically and socially, they were really still about a year behind 
their classmates, maybe more, when they started 2nd and 4th grade 
last year -- but by the end of the school year they were almost 
working at grade level and were nearly on par socially with their 
classmates.

In terms of their sizes, which was a MAJOR driver behind holding them 
back 1 year -- I would say they were about in the middle of their 
classes in terms of their heights and weights when they started 
school.  HOWEVER, after being home for 16 months -- BOTH kids were at 
the 60th percentile for height for their AGES -- making them two of 
the tallest kids in their grades.

I don't have the exact figures on how much they grew -- but we know 
that in the first 18 months after Nicholas left the orphanage he grew 
more than 7 inches and Kira grew more than 6 inches and gained 11 
pounds the first year home.

We did initially consider holding them back 2 years from their age 
peers when they came home -- but we are VERY, VERY glad now that we 
didn't do that.  If we had held them back 2 grades instead of just 
one BOTH kids would have TOWERED over the other kids right now.  
Academically they would have been better off, but socially it would 
have been disasterous.  As it is now, the kids look noticeably bigger 
than many of their classmates -- which is incredible given how small 
they were compared to most of the other kids when they came home.

Anyway, this is what we did....

This is something that I have also considered for the child that I intend to 
adopt, in order to put her on a more even level with her "peers" here. She just 
turned 6, but is about the size of a 3 1/2 year old.

As far as I know, she has not gotten any formal schooling yet where she is, 
even though she would be in Kindergarten or 1st grade here by now. I want her 
to have every advantage to get the most out of her experiences in life, and 
feel that she will be best served by allowing her to be the "same age" as other 
children that are closer to her size and developmental level.

Hi Everyone, 

This is the 'short bio' that was requested. It is
reprinted here. 
My name is
Vanessa and I am in the process of adopting from
Kazakhstan. I live in Connecticut. I have completed
the home study process but am waiting for one more
piece of paperwork to come back, that will make it
official. I've also started the INS process. My
homestudy agency is the Adoption Resource Center of
Connecticut and I plan to work with World Child on the
actual adoption. I have already been in touch with
them.
I am hoping to adopt two children as an older single
parent (no more than 1 boy). I would like the children
to be between 1 and 5 or 6 years old, and, if
possible, siblings.
I would like any information that I can get on the
process for the next stage of it, any information from
people who have 'been there' and I would love to
network with people who will be doing this as well.
Many thanks and I look forward to 'meeting' all of
you.

Vanessa

The hardest part about this decision, and the one I think some people 
don't think enough about, is what the child's situation is likely to 
be 2 or 3 years down the road.  

Nicholas was at about the 25th percentile for height (given his bio 
age) when we brought him home -- but is now -- less than 18 months 
after coming home -- at about the 60th percentile for height.  When 
we brought him home he looked to be about 7 or 8 years old -- but now 
looks every bit his 11 years old.

Kira was about the size of a typical American 4 year old when we 
first met her in November/December '99, although she was 8 years 
old.  She barely wore a size 6 when we brought her home in April 2000 
and looked by then to be about 5 or 6 years old.  Now, less than 18 
months later -- she looks like any other 9 year old -- and looks 
noticeably older than many of her classmates -- some of whom are 
almost 2 years younger than she is now.

We NEVER would have believed how much the kids would grow and change 
in such a short time -- and I'm sure it's hard for other parents to 
imagine, as well.  However, I also know what we experienced doesn't 
happen in every case and that many kids remain small or about the 
same size as their younger classmates.  Knowing what will happen in 
any individual case is pretty much guesswork...but you should think 
about how you will handle a situation in which your child is 
significantly older than his or her classmates -- but does not have 
the academic strenght to skip a grade later on.

Just our two cents worth about changing/not changing birthdates.  We chose NOT to adjust our son's age because he was already showing signs of being on the tall side - even for a Kazak.  Liam was 8 (birthday is 17 Oct) when I brought him home on 1 March this year.  Within a couple of weeks of coming home, he was placed into a first grade in an Arlington, VA public school with ESL classes for 2 1/2 hours every morning.  This provided 2 things for him:  (1) he was placed with an age group that matched his social development plus (2) he was still getting ESL.  We found Liam was reluctant to mix with any neighborhood children until he started school and socialized with American kids.

Since we have relocated to the Jacksonville, FL area, Liam has entered second grade in Clay County.  Here the ESOL classes are total immersion so that he is in with children from a variety of cultural backgrounds but they are allowed to only speak English in the classroom.  He is also taken for special work with the Title 1 teacher as are some of the other children who lag behind in reading, English and/or math.

We've noticed considerable growth in Liam over the last seven months in terms of height and maturity.  If he catches up academically, we may consider skipping a grade.  However, we don't make much of a deal over the year or two difference between he and some of his classmates.  He is, by the way, not the only one his age in his class.  Guess we feel, as Laura said earlier, that his birthdate was really the one thing that was all his from Kaz and it is as much a part of his identity as his brown eyes and warm smile.

Could someone please clarify what is meant by "changing" their child's age?
Since their true age is part of their adoption records and visa(s), I assume
that you just mean to let them believe they are a different age.  Yet it
will be clear to the child immediately, if not soon, that they are engaged
in some sort of deception (no harshness intended), won't it?  Won't they be
inclined to want to tell others their "true" age?  Our 5-year old son-to-be
was very well aware of how old he was this summer.  A parent's wanting to be
understanding of their child's sensitivity to his/her
social/academic/physical lag compared to his/her age-level American
counterparts seems laudable, but I agree that this recourse should probably
not be entered into lightly.  I had a 14 year old in my classroom this
summer who came from Russia when he was 10.  Aside from a bit of lingering
awkwardness with some aspects of writing, their was remarkably nothing
socially to separate him from his classmates (and in math he was very
proficient).  On top of this, he was from a household where the parents
spoke almost entirely Russian around the house!

Some parents legally change their child's age at the time of adoption 
in Kazakhstan.  From what I understand this is "technically" 
impossible to do in Kaz and Russia -- but I do know of parents who 
did this during the overseas adoption process -- usually to make 
their child 1 - 2 years younger.

In other cases, parents either tell their child they are a year 
younger than they actually are -- and the kids believe this -- while 
in other cases parents discuss it with the child and agree to 
consider the child a year or two younger.

Parents in many states also have the option to legally change their 
child's age at the time of readoption, and sometimes can even 
petition a judge outside of a readoption.  Standards vary by state 
and sometimes by jurisdiction as to if/how parents can do this -- so 
it's best to talk with adoptive families in your community if you are 
considering legally changing your child's age.  For example, I know 
parents who simply petitioned the court without any 
supporting "documentation" as to why the child should be made younger 
who successfully changed their kids ages -- while other parents had 
to submit dental, medical and psychological records supporting the 
position that the child was "younger" than his or her stated age.

>>Yet it will be clear to the child immediately, if not soon, that

Not necessarily.  Many of these kids have no idea how old they are -- 
and some "think" they are one age but are actually another (usually 
older) age.  It depends on what the practice is in the orphanage -- 
some recognize birthdays and group kids by age -- while others do 
little, if anything, to recognize birthdays or segregate the kids 
according to age groups.  Our kids knew how old they were, and the 
season their birthday was in...but I suspect that was ONLY because 
they were each in foster care and celebrated a birthday with their 
foster families just before their adoptions.

Hi Ms. Traylor,

I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be 
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look
like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

Regards,

Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom)

Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received 
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & address 
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's 
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can 
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom

Please add to my contact list - this is one of Chad's teachers

Hi, Ms. Corman.

This is Mrs. Jung.  This is my email if you ever need it for future
reference.  :)

Flat Stanley was sent in the envelopes provided from home.  I had the kids
put labels with the school's address on it in the return address corner.  I
also included an envelope with the school's address on it so that Stanleys
could be returned.  I'm glad to hear Stanleys are being anticipated.  I know
the kids are really excited about them.

I'm also glad to hear Chad's enjoying school.  We are definitely doing
harder work than Kindergarten.  We're actually doing different work than the
rest of first grade - more challenging, mind-stretching work, I'd like to
believe.

I was very encouraged by your letter and just wanted to express my
appreciation for sharing your thoughts with us.  Thanks again!  Let me know
if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Jung

1.  Friday, August 17, and Saturday, August 18 we are 25 MW SHORT at PGE's System for HE 15 thru HE 20.  Note:  This is not the same as being short at the Mid-C.  Purchases to fill this short should be put in the short-term Northwest book.  Buy from whomever and notify PGE Real-Time Merchant of the supply.

2.  Friday, August 17, and Saturday, August 18 we are 45 MW short for HE 1-6 and HE 23-24, and 27 MW short for HE 7-22 to Portland General at the MID-C.  Supplier should be at the Mid-C.  Purchases to fill this short should be put in the short-term Northwest book.  Buy from whomever and notify PGE Real-Time Merchant of the supply.

3.  For Friday, August 17 we have 100 MW for HE 07-23 delivered to Portland General at their system (Puget->BPA->PGE).  This is supply for a schedule we will have going to NCPA at COB (PGE->Enron->PGE Trans->NCPA).  The tags have been built already (30070 for Friday and 30071 for Saturday) and are pending.  You will have to implement them at the appropriate time.  You do not need to notify Puget or BPA.  Just coordinate the schedule between PGE and NCPA.

4.   For Friday, August 18 we have 100 MW for HE 07-22.  Same set up as in (3), only 7-22 instead of 7-23. 

Just a clarification.  The new leg 3 is just for onpeak (correct?), and the premium is $2 total, not in addition to premium of first deal.  Is this correct?

Stewart,

Per our discussion I have changed Modesto basis option deal #520328 to reflect the restructured terms:

* original peak deal (leg 1) deal end date was changed from 9/30/01 to 8/5/01. 
* new leg 3 was created for 8/6/01-9/30/01.  All terms stay the same except that strike price was changed to $3 and an extra premium was added for $2/MWh for the new leg.

I have also put a note in the comment field requesting the confirm group to send documents to you before sending to counterparty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

All of your benefits information has been updated.  As you have continued to receive the flex dollars every paycheck but not the deductions, you may see that you have a very small paycheck on 8/15 to make up for your 6/30, 7/15 and 7/31 deductions. 

Sorry for any inconvenience that this may cause!

Amy

They have all been corrected.

Carmen

Yes, I will forward your message to Synhrgy b/c they never received the reversal information and need to remove the term date also.

Thanks, 
Ginger

Ginger

The following employee termed then didn't and finally never left the company, however the benefits were not reinstated when we reversed the termination.  Can I go in and end date all the Reoccurring Payments IT0014 to 12/31/9999?

odd lot sp15. 
Thanks so much. Hope your doing well.

Thanks, Sean

Sean,

  Don't want to hound you, but Houston has to send payment today and it's 4 pm there.
  Let me know if you want me to enter an annuity

  Virginia

I'll be putting it in today.

Sean,

  When you get a chance, please let me know if you would like me to put in that annuity for Modesto or if you want to put it in.

  Let me know if you have any questions about the spreadsheet that I sent to you.

  Virginia

I think I fixed them.  Sorry about that.  Let me know if there are any other problems.

Sean:

Just wanna follow up w/ you on the deal number I gave to you yesterday.  Deal# 682306.1 was an interdesk deal between LTNW and STNW.  The flow hours are for offpeak only, but the index entered is Dow Jones Mid Columbia index rather than Dow Jones Mid Columbia Offpeak index.  I noticed that you changed the index for another deal number (#682297.1) I gave you.  Just wondering if this one should be changed too.  

Thanks,

Here are my comments

1.  I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity.  In fact, in the Northwe=
st at least, they have actually increased liquidity.  Any decrease in liqui=
dity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty abou=
t the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the ca=
p (removing marketers as sellers).

I would propose the following cap timelines.  First of all, I think it's im=
portant that FERC realize the "spot" market really is two separate markets,=
 what we call the "day-ahead" cash markets, and "day-of" real-time markets.=
  The 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timeline=
s and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and disp=
atch of power plants.  For example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:=
00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries.  However, on Thursd=
ays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries, and on F=
ridays, we trade for Sunday and Monday (all of this can be adjusted for var=
ious reasons, but this is the typical schedule).  If we held to the 24-hour=
 spot cap literally, then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the da=
y-ahead market, but would not apply to Saturday and Monday.  This obviously=
 cannot be an intended consequence.  I recommend the cap timeline be consis=
tent with the day-ahead WSCC OTC trading timelines.

In addition, there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the=
 day-ahead market.  What if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures=
 and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 85% thr=
eshold?  Assume that stage I, II or even III is a certainty.  It seems prud=
ent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established (still consistent with=
 FERC's guidelines).  Why?  Because you would want units prescheduled to ha=
ve high reserve margins going into real-time, rather than scrambling to dis=
patch units real-time.  It seems like it would be prudent for some independ=
ent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 85% or Stage I=
 limit prior to trading time.  This board would have to have regional repre=
sentatives in order to be truly effective.  Establishing the cap does not h=
ave to be cumbersome or time consuming, in fact, it should be fairly easy.

The cap governing real-time transactions is clear.  However, what isn't cle=
ar is what happens when the new Stage I cap is actually lower than the exis=
ting 85% of stage I cap.  For example, during the first couple of days in J=
uly the real-time cap was operating under the 85% of Stage 1 criteria, appr=
oximately $92.  The ISO hit a Stage I and Stage II and the price actually f=
ell to the $70s.  This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen=
.  As a result supply was apparently affected in California and the Southwe=
st for a few hours across the peak.  It seems odd that prices should fall r=
eal-time as reserve margins decrease.  One could argue this is a good reaso=
n why caps should be tied to daily gas prices, but assuming that isn't an o=
ption, I propose something like this:  The DAY BEFORE (around 2200) the CAI=
SO, or preferably an independent body, would determine the real-time non-St=
age cap as well as a Stage minimum.  While in a stage I, II, or III the hou=
rly price would be the HIGHER of the non-stage price cap OR the recalculate=
d Stage price.  If the Stage I price turned out lower, then the non-stage p=
rice would be used for that hour, but the recalculated Stage I cap (and cor=
responding 85% price) would apply for the NEXT operating day, and for day-a=
head cash trading for the next trade day.  This provides information before=
 the trading period (enhancing liquidity) and eliminates strange price move=
ments during real-time.  It also fits the FERC price cap paradigm.

2.  Marketer prices.  I think there is a clear bias against marketers in th=
e order.  But given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketer=
s, there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recov=
er costs that are easily demonstrable.  First would be losses at a tie into=
 California.  If we sell at the cap and incurr losses, then we can't sell a=
t the cap.  Second would be the 10% credit premium.  Credit issues apply wh=
ether you're a marketer or generator.  Third would be call options.  It see=
ms if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option=
, that a party should be able to exercise and sell.  I'm not sure what the =
difference between a peaking plant and a call option is.

All:

Please review the attached rough arguments on what the FERC must do to fix =
it's current WSCC wide price mitigation mechanism.

Enron's (or its trade associations') filing(s) will attack bigger issues su=
ch as whether there should be price controls at all and whether the CAISO n=
eeds to be audited.  However, assuming we are stuck with a cap, I want to p=
rovide FERC with comments that at least allows marketers to stay in busines=
s.  The comments in the attached document are designed to address these "nu=
ts and bolts" issues.  Formal comments are due next week but I need input f=
rom commercial folks like you by WEDNESDAY of this week.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes

 << File: FERC Rehearing Draft Portion GAC.doc >>

Here are some questions/comments I have regarding the ruling.

1.  How does the cap apply to index prices.  If the DJ-PV index settles at $120 and the cap is $98, do parties selling index have to adjust there price to $98?

2.  Would financial products (swaps) be affected by the cap?

3.  There has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets.  For example, assume it's a Monday and the ISO is under normal conditions and the price is $92.  Then assume on HE 14 the ISO declares a stage one and the price clears at $100 and the price is $100 for the rest of the day.  Tuesday assume the price is $85 during the first few offpeak hours, but the Wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as Monday.  What is the day ahead cash cap trading Tuesday for Wednesday?
Is it $85 or $100?  One could make the argument that it should be $100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on Wednesday, but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one.

It seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded.  So for the example, they may recognize it's likely a stage 1 $100 cap will be in effect on Wednesday, so they'll set the cap at $100.  The market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity.  More efficient market, less litigation.

4.  What about call options?  If a generator owns a call option at $125, the cap is $100, but the market is actually trading $150, does the generator have the right to exercise the option?  What if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at $150.  Does the generator have to wait until the price hits $150?  Seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense.  And would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option?

Thanks Bruce, I appreciate it.

I forward this on to McCabe.  Joe Toussaint will be talking to him.  I will
get you an answer this week.

Hey Bruce,

Thanks for the response.  I think I would like to see Cinergy's bid.  I
sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well.  It would be nice
to know where we are at.  If you could provide me a rough number, that
would be helpful.

Looks good then, let's try it.

Yes.  We tried to take the language from one of the NP or SP peak products.

Kevin,

Is the SP and NP language in the spread language the same language we use when we transact SP15 or NP15 on eol?

Please review the documents attached below to ensure they are reading correctly with regard to the products you will be offering.  Once you let me know how this looks to you, I will be able to move forward with the creation of the products.

Steve,

Thanks for the dinner and chance to meet everyone Friday.  It actually was a pleasure to talk with Nancy (rare, I think for an interview situation).

I'm sorry to say I'm still in a holding pattern.  There are a couple of bits of information I still need to process, but I thought I would email you with some initial numbers.  I'd also like to confirm my understanding of Duke's compensation program.

Base Salary:  $150K-$175K/year

LTI:  100% of base salary paid out in options that vest 1/3 every year.

Performance Incentive:  2X to 6X base salary.

No contract.  Full relocation package.

This is what I recall from the interview.  If I'm wrong, I'd appreciate clarification.

Regardless of what happens, I appreciate your time and consideration.  I should be able to come to a decision next week.

Thanks,

Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email. Perspective comes quickly
at 8000 meters and today, thinking back on the ascent and all the rock
climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my
perpetually clumsy condition (wrsened by AMS), I am happy to be alive. The
weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and
dying, including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for
the north side. By the time i am allowed to send this, the media will have
already begun reporting on this tragedy. I was slowed by my vomiting and had
i continued, i likely would have been trudging up with this group.

In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends: ensuring
his safety so suz and i could take a vacation. He is stuck on the ridge now,
dying, and will likely be dead by morning. One of our strongest guides is
with him and he, too, will probably die. This guy is super strong but the
altitude has snatched him. We're in shock here and can do nothing but stare
into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight. I have been
assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives. A
member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning, 3
Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge, and a spaniard is flirting
with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema, despite Chris
Warner's valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night. When i
think of this mountain now, i think only of death.

Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first time
he has unleashed the team for our own. It is a totaly professional
logistical operation (locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up
into the jet stream), relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly
strong. Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come. The
guide and the client spent the night on the ridge (8650 meters), incoherent
and immobile, freezing, but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a
desperate stumble home, climbed the second step (brutal) for the second time
in 10 hours, and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark.
Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes, reaching
top camp (8300 meters...still incredibly dangerous) at 11:30 pm. It was a
relatively warm night (just below)and both client and guide were seen moving
space blankets this morning through the telescope. Alive. But they could not
stand. One could not see. No comms. Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics and
you are sure to read about this.

Coordinating therescue from the Col, Russ then rousted all available bodies
and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days, Purba and
Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone, humping oxygen. The
American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up
their summit attempt (remember, they failed last week and also failed in '99
so this is a huge sacrifice) to make the rescue. It looked bleak this
morning but after some injections our teammates began to move, carried by
the strong Americans. As i type, they have been moving at a snail's pace and
the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselves.We hope our
sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an
absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue. Remember, that ridge is 14
inches across for stretches, dropping 10,000 feet on either side. When i
gazed down 2 nights ago, it was truly like staring out of the window of a
plane, so steep was the drop. The sherps are going to have to be supermen.

From the ridge and high camp, chris and asmus (they've been wasting there
for over 36 hours now) have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter descent
to ABC. They are sucking some themselves to ensure we don't have a
double-rescue. I'm feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help
with the rescue, assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive. Too high
for a helo on this side so we'll have to platoon them down asap. Other
members who summitted earlier are still up too high, too slow descending
from 'safe' camps, and i may help them down as well. So i will not be back
by mem day--we have to get these people down.

The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope, sulking
and making occasional trips to the waste moraine. The client was slower and
slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field. I thought: uh oh.
Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold
and the guide was pursuaded by the client. Soon russ was on the radio
screaming at the guide to drag the client down, but the hour grew late and
suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap, both men immobile
and nearly incoherent, the guide kicking and draggin the client, to no
avail. Asmus was with them and performed valiantly, as i mentioned, but no
one was in a position to help. At that height, every second counts and the
other teams rushed past on their way to safety. When you rush into a burning
building you can't linger, especially if your physical performance is
literally cut in half.

I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  it's hard to think f
anything else as they progress home, mumbling, step by step. I have messages
from their wives but they are unable to [process spoken language at this
point. Even if they get down, i wonder what the results will be. It's really
sad. I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--i'll explain the process
when i get home but siffice to say you literally can't boil water fast
enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude. My heartbeat at top camp
was 180 when i was 'resting' in my sleeping bag before the attempt. My
tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids
coming at a rate of a liter an hour, doing nothing.

I feel lucky today. Very lucky. When i think of my own descent, alone,
throwing up along the way yesterday, i realize just how razor-thin this
whole thing is. There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my
jumar on a supposedly new rope, ony to reach the anchor point to find a
ten-year-old knot, totally fried by the uv rays. Other times i stepped in
snow footprints and slipped, sliding down on my stomach until the rope
jerked taut. Too many ways to die here.The aussie who gave me his water in
the bowl may have prevented another casualty. Who's to say? Problem here is
that, unlike the events we're used to when we sprint to the finish line (we
used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the
finish), you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the
mountain. And it's so hard to do that. Is a quarter tank enough? Half? Or do
you need even more because, in truth, you are dying from the moment you
leave camp 3 (not even top camp).

I will pass this info only when the word is out--sorry--but will keep you
updated from there once i talk ro russ. It's hard watching friends die but
we're helpless down here.

Bruce,

The 600K is salary, and nonperformance related bonus payouts.  It is NOT guaranteed bonus over and above salary (I wish it was).  Basically, I am 95% certain I will make a minimum of 600K/year with either company, worst case I'm looking at 500K/year (excluding incentive).  Incentive would be in addition to.  My offer would have to be in that ballpark.  If I worked 1/3 the year, assuming a base salary in the 250 to 300 range, I would get 100 less.  Also, I'm not trying to be vague.  Essentially I'm working with 3 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet.  At this point, let's look at this:  2-year contract with an out after 1-year.  $275 base salary.  $225 signing bonus.  $225 retention bonus after 1-year.  If I take it, I'm done for another year.  Participation in the 17% incentive package.  Relocation package.  That seems to be the ballpark we are in.

Thanks,

Sean

Thanks.  My last question.  If you start on Sep 1 do you get 600k by Feb 1,
2002?  That is if you are working for a 1/3 or the year do you get that kind
of bonus guaranteed?

Sean, I'm not trying to be a pain but I have a simple style when it comes to
hiring, I just need to know exactly how everything fits together.  If you do
not wish to reveal that it your choice.    I tried to get the best package
put together so there is not a lot of games.  I'm not sure we can match
those numbers and ultimately Tim McCabe will have to make that call, but it
helps if its a clear as possible.

It sounds like you have a lot of great opportunities.  We are having meeting
today to discuss the trading situation.  I will keep you posted.

Hey Bruce,

The 600 and 725 are guaranteed, yes.  I didn't mean to imply Cinergy
wouldn't pay out; I meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects
with established company/operations prospects.  Startup prospects are, I
think, more risky.

Also, I realize there are distinct advantages from living in Houston.  My
"reluctance" is more of a family/moving type of thing.  It is an issue, but
not a huge one.

Thanks,

Sean

   Thanks for the update.  I will forward this information.  I assume that
   the
   low numbers are guaranteed that no matter what happens to you or the
   company
   you will receive the min amount.  Is that true?  As far as Cinergy
   having a
   payout record- it does.  The bonus plan pays out 17% of profits, I don't
   think there is any other company paying that kind of money.  They paid
   on it
   last year.  However, the P&L has to be there, but the money was
   distributed.
   Also they pay on NPV of the deals so accounting doesn't enter into
   performance.  I think that is unique as well.

   As far as Houston goes, I can show you parts of the city that are
   beautiful
   and the commute is easy with lots of great neighborshood at tremendous
   value.  I'm 15 minutes from every venue (sport, education, theatre,
   musuems)
   in the fourth largest city in America.  In addition, your family will
   not be
   trapped to one employer.  I lived in a few places and visited numerous
   others, I think its the best value city in the country.  In addition,
   with
   the kind of money you will be making there is no state income in Texas.

   Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite
   frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at
   two
   other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract,
   the
   second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be
   around
   $275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as
   incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the
   first
   to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about
   $350
   to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at
   about
   $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

   In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations
   for
   me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not
   a
   big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.
   Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty
   confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the
   prospects of being on the "ground floor" with Cinergy, I also have to
   recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the
   probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would
   require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still
   participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would
   be
   willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet
   underneath
   us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate
   some
   serious money for the company.

   Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you
   achieve
   your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is
   serious
   money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.

   No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also
   extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in
   Cincinnati.

Hey Bruce,

The 600 and 725 are guaranteed, yes.  I didn't mean to imply Cinergy wouldn't pay out; I meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects with established company/operations prospects.  Startup prospects are, I think, more risky.

Also, I realize there are distinct advantages from living in Houston.  My "reluctance" is more of a family/moving type of thing.  It is an issue, but not a huge one.

Thanks,

Sean

Thanks for the update.  I will forward this information.  I assume that the
low numbers are guaranteed that no matter what happens to you or the company
you will receive the min amount.  Is that true?  As far as Cinergy having a
payout record- it does.  The bonus plan pays out 17% of profits, I don't
think there is any other company paying that kind of money.  They paid on it
last year.  However, the P&L has to be there, but the money was distributed.
Also they pay on NPV of the deals so accounting doesn't enter into
performance.  I think that is unique as well.

As far as Houston goes, I can show you parts of the city that are beautiful
and the commute is easy with lots of great neighborshood at tremendous
value.  I'm 15 minutes from every venue (sport, education, theatre, musuems)
in the fourth largest city in America.  In addition, your family will not be
trapped to one employer.  I lived in a few places and visited numerous
others, I think its the best value city in the country.  In addition, with
the kind of money you will be making there is no state income in Texas.  And
being in the energy trading business, it has no peer.

Hey Bruce,

Thanks for the chance to meet you and the people you work with.  I was just wondering where we are at now.  If you get a chance, either e-mail me or give me a call.

Thanks again,

Sean

Kevin,

Is the SP and NP language in the spread language the same language we use when we transact SP15 or NP15 on eol?

Please review the documents attached below to ensure they are reading correctly with regard to the products you will be offering.  Once you let me know how this looks to you, I will be able to move forward with the creation of the products.

Kevin

Kevin - Provided the traders are of the same opinion as to how the products should be described, this works. - Marcus

Here are the documents we discussed.  For your convenience, I have my changes tracked.  Please let me know if this works.

Thank you.
Kevin
(713) 853-9555

 << File: Power spread NP-COB.doc >>  << File: Power spread SP-PV.doc >> 

Thanks for your response.  I was wondering if you guys have public information about the spill program coming up.

Sean, how can we help you?

Ed Mosey

If I can build a product, I'm ready any time.  We can test it internally before we go live.  Let me know if I can build the product.

Thanks

Hi Sean,

Do  you have any idea when you would feel comfortable getting the product out on EOL ?

Kevin

This looks like it will work.  Since there has been some confusion around this, I'll lay out what I think will happen with this language.

Assumption #1:

MC on EOL is 300 at 350.
COB is not displayed on EOL.

Product 1 is COB; Product 2 is MC

COB/MC Spread is 5 @ 10 on EOL

Situation #1
Customer lifts the COB/MC spread at $10.  Enron will then BUY the MC at $325 and SELL COB at $335.

Situation #2
Customer hits the COB/MC spread at $5.  Enron will then SELL the MC at $325 and BUY COB at $329.

This is how it should work.

I suggest we test things out now, and see how it works.

Thanks,

Sean

Attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly TTC and ATC data for COB S/N from Jan 1, 2000 to April 2001.  The data were obtained from the ISO.
After looking at the data, it is clear that, although the TTC values have not changed from '00 to '01, the ATC values have decreased dramatically.  I believe the reason for this is the ISO's attempt to prevent exports to the Northwest.

I propose that we send this spreadsheet to our ISO rep (via Sue Mara) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.

Thanks

Steve,
 
The difference is because I rounded the purchase prices from AEP and Avista in the P&L spreadsheet, rather than taking a weighted average.  The wire request amount is correct.

Sean,  
 
I came up with a $3936 difference between this and your wire requests.  The wire requests were on the high side.  I am sending it off to Houston with a note that we may need to revise it.

This gets even better.  On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much.  There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.

We asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : "Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements".

The ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!  In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria.  If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.

Steve Walton

Sean is absolutely right about the misuse of CBM.  Capacity Benefit Margin was put in the ATC standard at the beginning to allow a party to recognize the use of interconnections to reduce the amount of reserve a system must carry internally. The only capacity which California could restrict on that basis is inbound.  Has California decided to be the protector of the reserves of the NW with its puny installed capacity within the state?  It is clearly manipulation for them to claim CBM for outbound capacity.  

Good investigating.

Sean,

Can you  make sure that FTRs in 01 did not rise up from 00 to make sure the effect is due to CAISO raising a capacity benefit margin?

Thanks, there fruity-pants.

Alan,

Attached is the memo I promised.  It's sort of rough, but accurate.  Please feel free to utilize any or all of it.  It would be interesting to get Steve Walton's feedback as well.  Also, this doesn't really address my concerns with respect to curtailing firm exports under muni-transmission (at least not completely).   If you have any questions, let me know.
 

Installed Windows 2000 at home and work; quite nice.  No compatability problems.  Good job.

Arvina,

Your numbers are close enough to mine to agree.  I put in an annuity to Modesto for $158,321.16 dated March 31.  The Enron deal number is 573111 (just in case there is any confusion).

If there are any problems, give me a call.

Thanks,

Sean

Attached are my final comments.  They deal more with the proposal to curtail exports (including muni).  I don't really care if we file this with the material we have already put together, or do something with it separately.  With respect to the ATC and TTC questions we were addressing earlier, I haven't added anything to what Steve put together.  The CAISO's argument about restricting ATC because of Path 15 congestion, because, as Steve points out, any technical problems would affect both TTC AND ATC.  If anyone has any questions, let me know

 

Seems like one or each desk could participate.  The problem would be the unrecorded line.

A few weeks ago Lavorato requested that the west power desk sit in on his morning meeting with the different desk heads.  I suggested that one of the cash traders sit in on the meeting as you guys have the best handle on what is likely to happen in the short term markets and you guys are always here at 5:45.  Jeff Richter has been sitting in on these meetings for the last couple of weeks.  I don't care how you guys handle it.  I originally thought that rotating between you guys might make sense.  These calls should be made on a regular line that is not recorded.  Let me know how you want to work it out.  If you are going to rotate, I would like to put together a schedule that I could have for myself and forward to Lavorato.  Thanks.  Let me know your thoughts.

Steve,

Please wire $520,800 to AEP (same info as Tom Alonso's) and wire $567,084 to AVISTA (same info that we've been using).  This will take care of our Northwest book of business for Feb 1 through Feb 9.  I will send you the P&L calculation a little later.

Thanks
Sean

Kevin,

Here are the examples we talked about

Assumptions:

1.  EOL and Broker market:  COB $30 @ $40.
2.  We put out a COB/MC market $4 at $7.
3.  In EOL, Product 1 = COB and Product 2 = MC.

Here's what will happen in the broker market:

(A) If someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market I will BUY COB at something like $35, and I will SELL Mid-C at $31.
(B) If someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market I will SELL COB at something like $35, and I will BUY Mid-C at $28.

If you take the same assumptions and show this market on EOL, here's my understanding of what will happen:

(C) If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL COB at $35, and I will BUY MC at $39 (compare this with (A))
(D) If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY COB at $35, and I will SELL MC at $42 (compare this with (B)).

Clearly this doesn't work.

One possible solution, I think, is to examine what happens if you put out a COB/MC product on EOL, but switch the products such that Product 1 = MC and Product 2 = COB, and assume we put the underlying Product 1 market out as MC $30 @ $40.

(E)  If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL MC at $35, and I will BUY COB at $39 (achieves same result as (A), which is what we want).
(F)  If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY MC at $35, and I will SELL COB at $42 (achieves the same result as (B), which is what we want).

I realize (E) and (F) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Bruce,

I haven't had an opportunity to call you directly yet, so I thought I would e-mail you first and sort of lay out the circumstances.

I've been a short-term trader with Enron for about 4 years -- I run our short-term Northwest book.  Prior to that, I cash traded for Portland General for a couple of years.  My contract with Enron is up July 31, and I have a 3-month non-compete obligation.  Theoretically, the earliest I could leave Enron would be May 31, so the earliest I could start with another shop would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  I'm talking to a couple of other outfits and I basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there.  I talked with Matt, and he mentioned you, so I thought it might be a good idea to get in touch.  If you are interested in pursuing anything further, please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone.

Thanks,

Sean

We've been experimenting with spreads on EOL and I want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on EOL.

Assume you want to put out the COB/MC spread -4 at 4.  Also assume COB is 275 at 300.  As you know, if you put this out in the broker market, you would expect to buy COB $4 under Mid-C or sell COB $4 over.

If you want to duplicate these trades on EOL you could put out COB/MC -4 at 4, but here is what's going to happen (assume COB mid is 287.5).  If somebody 'hits' your 'bid' you will sell COB at 287.5 and buy Mid-C at 283.5.  If somebody 'lifts' your 'offer' you will buy  COB at 287.5 and sell MC at 291.5.  Effectively the EOL transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid, or the title is COB/MC but the transaction is MC/COB.  The problem it seems to me is that, fundamentally, bid is always first, offer is second.  For this to work as is, the market would have to accept that, in all cases bid/offer applies except with EOL spreads where it's offer/bid.

This seems too confusing to me.  I'm not sure how you guys feel about  it, but I want to give you a heads up.

Steve,

I've been talking with James over the last couple of weeks about possible opportunities at Duke.  Just to give you a quick look at my background, I've been running Enron's short-term Northwest desk for about 4 years.  Prior to that, I performed more or less the same function with PGE for a couple of years.  My contract with Enron is up July 31.  I'm under a 3-month noncompete obligation after I leave Enron.  Theoretically, my last day with Enron could be May 31, so the first day I'd be able to start somewhere else would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  My goal is to have 3-4 options to consider by May 31.  I'll be in Salt Lake on May 4, so if you are interested in getting together to talk about any opportunities Duke might have, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sean

Today is a good time.  E-mail me with a number I can reach you at, a time, and I'll give you a call from my cell phone.

Thanks

Sounds good.  I'll give you a call.

Kevin

This looks like it will work.  Since there has been some confusion around this, I'll lay out what I think will happen with this language.

Assumption #1:

MC on EOL is 300 at 350.
COB is not displayed on EOL.

Product 1 is COB; Product 2 is MC

COB/MC Spread is 5 @ 10 on EOL

Situation #1
Customer lifts the COB/MC spread at $10.  Enron will then BUY the MC at $325 and SELL COB at $335.

Situation #2
Customer hits the COB/MC spread at $5.  Enron will then SELL the MC at $325 and BUY COB at $329.

This is how it should work.

I suggest we test things out now, and see how it works.

Thanks,

Sean

Why

Here's what changes:  COB:  We are not going to deliver to Midesto (Deal # 3689.4)
MC:  BPA deal # 51353 and Busbar BPA deal # 85098 are cancelled.

Sean,
 
Do the Feb. and March positions you sent this morning account for the termination of the two BPA contracts?  If not, can you send me a revised version when you get a chance?  I am not sure which BPA deals here are terminated and which ones are still good.  Thanks.
 
Steve

I completed mine on Monday the 4th.

If you have not already taken your drug test , please do so by Tuesday, 5th February.   This process needs to be completed and results fed back to UBS prior to your start date.   You cannot commence employment with UBS until they have this data which takes approximately 5 days from date of test.

If for any reason you cannot take this test by tomorrow, please advise.    Also, if you have completed your test please let me know so I can update the UBS records.

Regards,

Karen.

I agree with this.

Yesterday we received a letter from BPA under which BPA terminated two of its agreements.  Ed, Harlan and I discussed some aspects of this earlier today.

Some additional information that Steve Hall and I just discussed is summarized below.

The effect of this termination on our power scheduling is that the West Desk is now short by 202 MW over its earlier position.  

After termination the contract positions are:

 COB:  		150 MW on peak (purchase from BPA)
		200 MW off-peak (purchase from BPA)

 Mid-C:		(339) MW on peak (delivery to BPA)
		(238) MW off peak (delivery to BPA)

Terminated contract numbers:

	97 PB-10123  (Wauna/James River)
	98 PB-10277 (Firm Power Sale)

The termination fo the Wauna/James River contract presumably also terminates the "book out" agreement negotiated earlier this year, and increases our net short position to BPA.

Thanks

Sean,

I confirmed with Ed in Houston that we should cease deliveries.

Steve

We've been keeping this deal in because I've been concerned about congestions at COB.  I'm not concerned going into February, so this contract is out of the money for February (probably in March thru May however).  If there is some reason to keep it whole, we have the length at COB.  Let me know what we want to do.

I'm showing we have two deals in the system under BPA Contract #s 10123 and 10227:

Deal 85098 100 MW RTC Busbar purchase @$10.48.
Deal 51353 102 MW RTC Mid-C purchase @$21.6

If there are additional transactions other than these, I need to know within the next couple of hours.

Too bad I didn't talk with you a little earlier.  This sounds like a great job, and ultimately I would be very interested.  However, I'm basically under a 1-year deal now, so I won't be available until Feb '03.

Sean,
     Good luck at UBS.  I have attached the job description I was telling
you about.  We are also in the market for good marketers, traders and
structurers.  Keep in touch.

I agreed with the numbers on the spreadsheet.  We delivered 40 MW flat for Dec 1-4; Dec 5 25 MW flat; then 0 for remainder of month.

 << File: 1201 Smurfit MTD.xls >> 

These are the numbers Smurfit has.  

Please look over and approve.

Thanks

That's fine.  Just give me a call when you get in town to remind me.  Everything is fine at the townhome; it's quite comfortable.
 
Sean

Sean, thank you for your rent deposit yesterday.  I really appreciate your timeliness.  I will be in Portland Sat Jan 26 to Wed Jan 30 for business reasons.  
 
I need to have an electrician install smoke detectors per the new code effective the first of January + I want to get the phone jack fixed in the guest bedroom.  I also need to meet with the landscaper about pruning the back hedge.  I'll be up to my ears in business meetings all day Monday and Tuesday morning.  I was thinking about making appointments for the electrician and the landscaper for Tuesday afternoon.  I will be there to let them know what I need to have done so I can give them access.  Is that ok with you?    Is there anything else that needs attention?
 
Hope life isn't too crazy for you with all the press Enron is getting these days.  Deborah

No

Are there any other Chelan deals?

Yesterday I talked with Chelan's trader and she informed me they regard the 7 MW we are delivering to them as a "good" contract.  So long as we are able to deliver, they will accept deliveries.  I'm not sure what this means in light of their termination status, but since the price is $34, I'm going to deliver until I hear otherwise.

Sean

Alan asked me to email this to you.

All:

For those people wanting to learn more about Var calculation and application, I've put a copy of JP Morgan's RiskMetrics documentation on the P: drive under \MidMarketing\RiskMetrics. Of the five documents, Part 2 probably gets most directly at the questions that were being asked in Matt's seminar.

I have done the following trades to wrap up the Enron Northwest position for the balance of February.

1.  Bought 200 MW Onpeak at the Mid-C from AEP for $20 (Expense of $1,024,000).
2.  Bought 118 MW Onpeak at the Mid-C from Avista for $20 (Expense of $604,160)
3.  Bought 132 MW Offpeak at the Mid-C from Avista for $18.75 (Expense of $495,000)
4.  Bought 200 MW Offpeak of the MC/COB spread from AEP for $0.50 (Expense of $20,000)
5.  Sold 125 MW Onpeak of the COB/MC spread to AEP for $1.0 (Revenue of $32,000)

So we need to send $1,012,000 to AEP and $1,099,160 to Avista (total of $2,111,160).

Yesterday I talked with Chelan's trader and she informed me they regard the 7 MW we are delivering to them as a "good" contract.  So long as we are able to deliver, they will accept deliveries.  I'm not sure what this means in light of their termination status, but since the price is $34, I'm going to deliver until I hear otherwise.

On Dec. 21 CRC called and wanted to resume deliveries at the Mid-C (they are delivering to us).  I'm assuming this is OK.  Let me know otherwise.

On Dec. 21 CRC called and wanted to resume deliveries at the Mid-C (they are delivering to us).  I'm assuming this is OK.  Let me know otherwise.

Sean

Hey there!

How's it going?  I understand you guys stole one of our marketers.  That's ok, I'll forgive you.  Things are insanely boring here.  Basically we are in a wait mode, probably, I think, until February.  This is the first time in 5 years I haven't had to worry about P&L and I have to say it's pretty weird.  It's nice sleeping in though.

So supposedly we have 14 potential suitors. You've probably heard of the banks, and I've also heard Reliant is putting together a bid.  THAT would be interesting.  We laid off probably half the people in our office--pretty much all back office support and some conservation/renewable people.  Bad timing.  Plus, when we laid off Enron Broadband folks, they got a six month severance package, and EBB didn't make any money, and in fact lost a substantial amount.  Then Enron lays off people on our floor, which has made a phenomenal amount of money, and gives them basically $4,000 taxed at 48%.  Life is not fair.

It's going to be interesting to see what this does to the industry.  I think the California debacle, then Enron (now Calpine), is going to create an interesting dynamic going forward.  Credit is going to become more and more an issue, especially towards the back of the curve.  It's interesting, I remember 5 years ago the prediction was, when it was all said and done, there would be 6 big energy suppliers in the country.  Looks like it's heading that way.

So are you going to Europe?  Sounds like fun.  If it looks like we're going to be on the sidelines for a while, I might go on vacation for a couple of weeks, maybe Hawaii.

Well, I'm going to go grab a cup of coffee.  I hope everything is well with you.

Take care,

Sean

Sean,

This is just to confirm our conversation over the phone on 12/04/01 at about
9:45 AM Pacific Time.
You stated that Enron will not be able to deliver the 10 MW HLH energy MID C
product to Grays Harbor PUD starting at HE 7 for 12/05/01.

Pursuant to Section 21.3 of the WSPP Agreement we will take steps to
mitigate damages for failure to deliver power.

Please reply with your written confirmation.

Dear Portland Friends,
 
I am sorry I did not have to opportunity to say good-bye in person, so I am sending this message instead.  I am hoping that this message reaches all of you.  
 
It has been my privilege to have been able to work with and represent you in the various western region forums that were of interest to Enron.  I want to wish all of you the best for the future and if any group of individuals can make a new Enron work again it would be you.  I have learned a lot in my brief tenure at Enron and it has been especially satisfying working with professionals like each of you.  Hopefully sometime in the future our paths will cross again.
 
Happy Holidays to you and your families.  Also, if someone could also pass along this message to Cara S. in scheduling it would be much appreciated. (I cannot remember how to spell her last name...sorry Cara!)
 
Kindest Regards,
 
Dave

Fran,

Due to the fact Houston killed several transactions (as opposed to zeroing them out in Scheduling), the real-time position manager is out of balance for December 2 and December 3 at the Mid-C and COB.  December 1 looks OK.  This seems like an issue that Houston is going to have to resolve since they know the deals that were killed.  I will put the necessary interdesk swaps in on Saturday, but I'm going to leave Sunday and Monday open at this point.  If you have any questions, let me or Diana know.

Thanks

Miller!

For the love of JESUS!  How are you.  What's up with the layoffs?  Absolutely amazing.  I have seen it all now.

Can you believe this?  I was hoping to call but the "peoplefinder" isn't working now.  I was hoping to hear "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!" one more time.

Miller

So what do you think?  Pretty wild, huh?

thanks

good.  i am tracking it to make sure that they receive them and get things off to the trustee.

yes. it came to the office.  i sent it to the yesterday.

did you get your doc?  have you sent it back to houston yet?  they haven't seen it.

yes. it came to the office.  i sent it to the yesterday.

Do I go and drop him off, or go?

Hi, 
Could you consider taking Nathan to Cub Scouts tonight?  Bruce is sick, so
Becky and one of the other Dads are going to run the meeting.  Becky thought
it would probably only be ? hour.  (This is a Den meeting, usually 1 hour,
rather than the longer Pack meeting.)  It starts at 6:30.  Thanks.

I closed out our Balance of February NW position.  The total we pay is $2,111,160.  I'll have more detail to you and Thome in a minute.

Fran,

We had a problem with the PGE loss return on that day; I thought we fixed it.  Anyway, I put in a crossdesk (deal 875570).  Thanks.

Diana and Sean:

We are not flat between LTNW and STNW for 11/15 (last Thursday) in Mid-Columbia:

Peak 3MW/hr => total 48 MWhs (LTNW short and STNW long)
OffPeak 1MW/hr => total 8MWhs (LTNW short and STNW long)

Since these volumes are relatively minimal, do you want me to go ahead and put in an interdesk swap between LTNW and STNW to flat you out at the curve price for 11/15 as of 11/14?

Let me know.  Thanks,

Fran

Audrey,

Here is a brief personal work history.  I've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988.  I started trading for Portland General Electric in 1995.  I've been a trader for Enron for the last 4 years.  I run Enron's short-term Northwest book.  I have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the Mid-Columbia and COB specifically, although I am responsible for the entire Northwest.  I also trade Palo Verde, SP15, and NP15.

I have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this:

1.  150 K Base Salary
2.  250 to 300 K Signing Bonus
3.  Various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary.

Quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing.  The compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sean Crandall

Thanks Fran.  Let me know if it bogs down or anything.  I'd like to get it done.

Sean, I am working with Nikolay in Enpower IT (Bill Crook's and Will Smith's group) on this project.  They advised the week after next week they shall give us something to test on.  I will update you on that when it happens.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about). 

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Hi there,

Thanks for the note.  It is very weird for sure.  I never thought it would happen to Enron.  One of the reasons I didn't go to a smaller shop, even though I was offered more money, was because I didn't want to deal with crap like this.  Lo and behold.  Life is strange.  Anyway, at this point it looks like Dynegy is the suitor for the big E.  I think it will happen.  The question will become, where are we going to be located?  Fortunately, I only have about 8 months left in my contract, so I won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  We'll see.

Italy is awesome.  Really really is.  I realize it more and more since I came back.  Tuscany is so cool.  If you go there, go to San Quirico, Montecino and Montepulciano.  Very cool little towns and good wine.  Florence is very cool as well.  I may go back there for a month or so this June if things aren't to wacky.  Have a good time there; I'm envious.

Sounds like you are doing better.  Also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  So do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  Do you miss the West?  I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies, but you never know.

Well, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.  I keep thinking things will mellow out a little, but things keep getting more and more strange.

It was great to hear from you and take care of yourself!

Sean

Hi Seaner,
How are things going? I hope your okay over there on the west coast. I can
sympathize with what your going through, I've been involved with a company
that everyone's watching, questioning, rethinking credit and exposure, and
on top of that friends and family calling to see how you are and assuming
the worst.  No matter where you go you get faced with the same questions,
you have to tell the same story over and over.  I remember from your last
email you had just renegotiated a deal with them, I hope that's going to
turn out the way you want and your not stuck. If there's anything that I can
do please let me know. 

Did I tell you, after hearing about your amazing trip through Europe I've
decided to follow suit. I'm trying to plan a trip to Italy for a week or so
in the next couple of months. I recall you said that that was one of your
favorite places to visit. I get excited jut thinking about it, I watched
'the talented mr ripley' and 'malena'(sub titles) again over the weekend to
get a feel for the place(most recent movies with an italian theme).
Otherwise same old stuff over here, I'm starting to work on some pipeline
and storage deals which are very interesting, modeling the optionality
(especially for interruptible storage) of the products can be very tricky
but the intrinsic value is pretty substantial if you can come up with the
right strategy. Any ways I was thinking about you and thought I'd drop a
line.  Take care, and please let me know if you need anything.

Sounds good.

I believe Stewart is out both Wednesday and Thursday. I would like to meet with you and Diana anyway, so lets meet at noon on Wednesday. Can I take you to lunch?

Wednesday or Thursday around noon would be OK.

Diana & Sean,

I understand your trying to set a customer meeting with Grant and Chelan and Douglas. I would be happy to assist in any way I can. Also, I would like to sit down and talk with you about these and other Northwest consumer owned utilities. Will you please take a look at your schedules and let me know a convenient time. 

Jeff

Thanks Steve.  I think we might be interested in pursuing something.  It's kind of hectic right now, so let me give you a call when things settle down a little bit.  Probably next week.  Talk with you later.

Sean:

Thanks for the dinner the other night.  I enjoyed meeting with you and Deanna and getting caught up on how things are going.  It was also good to hear that both of you are optimistic about the outlook with UBS.  I wanted to respond to your offer to meet with Mr. Belden to discuss potential opportunities within your origination group.  Having considered the opportunities relative to the outlook for my consulting business, I am not interested in pursuing the UBS opportunity at this time.  The concept of running the origination from Seattle intrigued me initially, but I cannot personally advocate a geographically segregated origination operation as a viable business solution.  

I would be interested in a follow up meeting with you and Tim, but I think my intent would be framed from exploring potential opportunities to provide consulting services to UBS rather than exploring employment opportunities.  I understand that this may not fit with your needs to prioritize your own time and efforts right now, but if you would like to get together, please let me know.

Also - I don't have Deanna's e-mail address.  If you could forward this on to her, I would appreciate it.  Thanks again for the dinner last week.

Hi Sean,
I've attached an excel file that has the TTC and ATC values for COB S-N from 1999 to current.

Hey,

You sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  Understandable though.  Tough and very weird times that's for sure.  Very sad.  The funerals must have been brutal.  I know I'm depressed by it because I get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  Hopefully things will improve.

Our stock has just been munched.  It sucks because we're doing well, but the other "half" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  Everyone was wondering why Skilling left; I guess we know why now.

Enough of the gloom and doom.  Sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good.  I knew that you would.  Here's some pros/cons for your options (recalling my vast experience;))  Structuring:  Interesting but not alot of dough.  Probably the most easily replaced by those fresh MBAs.  Trading:  Like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed.  Can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times.  Good dough if you make it though.  Marketing:  Low immediate, constant stress, but still competitive.  You have a great deal of charm and brains, so I think you would do quite well in this area.  In addition, there are a number of firms (Calpine, AEP, Coral) who are opening up an office in Portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing.  Might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home (plus you can buy me beer, which is always a plus for anyone's karma).

As far as your overall attitude towards the industry, I think I disagree.  I think it's a good industry to be in, particularly now, because no matter what, people need electricity.  And it's still changing, especially out West, so there will be challenges and opportunities.

It's great talking with you.  Cheer up.  Call your folks.  Run.  Punch a punching bag.  Do drugs (kidding).  Take care of yourself, and if you need anything, give me a buzz or drop an email.

Sean

Hi Sean, how are things going? I'm jealous about your trip to Europe. I
called you shortly after you returned from the trip and you filled me in on
your castle experience. I would love to do that someday. I had no idea you
were talking to Duke, I hope you got what you wanted and deserve from Enron,
your a great guy, and a good trader I hope they realize that. Life over here
on the east coast is interesting, first it was the attacks of the eleventh,
I took one week off from work and attended 6 funerals in NYC, it was
extremely sad. There were even people from my graduating class from Calgary
that worked in NY, I was shocked at how far reaching the effects were. Right
now we're just trying to live through and survive these biological attacks,
I live close to the white house and the mall, so I figure if anything big
happens I'll go quickly. Are people this messed up in the world, that all
they can think about is spreading pain, suffering, and death. What have we
come to? Sorry, just really philosophical today with all the TV's talking
about Anthrax over and over behind me. Work wise things are well, I'm at a
juncture here where the trading team is asking me if I would like to trade,
structuring is wondering if I'd like to do that full time, and with my
mid-marketing role and contacts, marketing wants me to become a full fledged
marketer, the trouble is I don't know what to do, I'm trying to delay the
decision as long as I can. I really have no regrets at PGET, the people are
great, the work is challenging, and they treat me well. But lately I'm
starting to feel very bearish on the whole industry. I can't tell you where
I'd want to go, when, or what industry I'm optimistic about, but I can't get
too excited on power right now. Anyway, take care, drop a line sometime.
later alligator

In case you don't, hey what's going on?  I haven't talked with you in a
long time, so I was wondering what's up with you?  How's DC?  How's PGE?
I'm doing OK.  I went to Europe in June (whole month).  Very nice.
Italy, Switzerland, France, and Netherlands.  Hard to come back.  Then I
almost went to Duke, but then came to agreement with Enron.  That was
interesting.  Anyway, just wanted to touch base.  Let me know what's
going on.

Sean

of course I'm here. what's up?? How are you doing?

Are you still around?

Hey Sean, sorry I hung up there. 
I was hoping you could still give me Scott's number, or whoever deals
with
odd lot sp15. 
Thanks so much. Hope your doing well.

Just to share.

In case I did not already say so, this is a great move for us, and hopefully
for you.  We need a big step-up in risk management in PBL and agency-wide.
You will help us get there.

	I'm pleased to inform you that Diane Cherry will be joining the Risk
Management Group on an informal detail to help us get the PBL Risk Strategy
completed.  The detail begins immediately.  Her skills and talents will be
particularly helpful in  acheiving buy-in across the PBL, facilitating
discussions, integrating the risk strategy work with the PBL indicators
project, integrating with the Corporate review of PBL risk practices,
leading change efforts and cultural issues, and generally structuring and
following a process that will be successful in getting a strategy in place
and implementation underway.  She will be accompanying me at first in a wide
variety of risk related activities/meetings to 'get her bearings'.    The
duration of this assignment is open ended but expected to last several
months.  Please welcome her and treat her as one of our team members. 

No

Do you guys envision offering odd lots like California currently does?

Stewart

Dow Jones is interested as well.  I really think a hourly index would be very useful; price discovery, financial positions, etc.

Sean,
Bobette from "Powerdex" wants to create an hourly index out west. Do you want to take a look at this and her template and give me your feedback. Would participation in this index accomplish anything for us?
 
Let me know,
 
Bill
 
 
It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 

Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you. 
 
Thanks,

M:\Electric\WEST\SCRANDA\ANALYSIS

Hey Kevin,

Just wondering what the status of the DART product is.

In case you don't, hey what's going on?  I haven't talked with you in a long time, so I was wondering what's up with you?  How's DC?  How's PGE?  I'm doing OK.  I went to Europe in June (whole month).  Very nice.  Italy, Switzerland, France, and Netherlands.  Hard to come back.  Then I almost went to Duke, but then came to agreement with Enron.  That was interesting.  Anyway, just wanted to touch base.  Let me know what's going on.

Sean

of course I'm here. what's up?? How are you doing?

Are you still around?

Hey Sean, sorry I hung up there. 
I was hoping you could still give me Scott's number, or whoever deals
with
odd lot sp15. 
Thanks so much. Hope your doing well.

I would like to go Monday through Wednesday.  Thanks.

Sean,

I recommend comming out for first 2-3 days.  My hunch is that diminishng re=
turns will kick in after that.

Sarah offered to help set up meetings with FERC staff too; we could talk ab=
out that.

I'm still working on the reading materials.

GAC

We have learned (through EPSA -- no FERC issuance has been made yet) that F=
ERC plans to have the follow panels for RTO Week, October 15-October 19:

Attendance on these panels is by invitation only.  Invitations are being ex=
tended by FERC Staff now. =20

Please call me if you have any questions.

Sarah

As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and =
papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to ad=
dress over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to En=
ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these iss=
ues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it=
 is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond. =20

In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to=
 respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will als=
o work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a part=
icular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call th=
e Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welc=
ome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for resp=
onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams nee=
d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.

On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i=
nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A "Project Lea=
d" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsibl=
e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t=
he proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex=
t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  Th=
e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho=
uld be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and pr=
oducing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments wil=
l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial =
people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues=
. =20

There is a column of "Inside Counsel" and "Outside Services."  In some area=
s, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  =
Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to=
 draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please=
 remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR proce=
ss must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the =
necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea=
d named for each proceeding:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will =
be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in =
Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron =
make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FE=
RC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also b=
e responsible for these comments.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments a=
re due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceed=
ing, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's =
marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is=
 a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commissio=
n to adopt this bold proposal.

ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has=
 indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requireme=
nts, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the=
 market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we p=
lan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit exp=
ert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be th=
e Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif=
ornia ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t=
o cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proc=
eeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, =
a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr=
ent price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps i=
n an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaki=
ng season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will b=
e starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc=
ourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be =
needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these procee=
dings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is =
the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission cons=
traints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  =
-- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission p=
lans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a hig=
h priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated tha=
t it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to id=
entify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progre=
ss in these proceedings.
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project =
Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market partici=
pants to provide more information than is currently required, including at =
least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a signi=
ficant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of c=
ommercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commis=
sion has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the Califor=
nia ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a h=
earing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact. =20
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The J=
udge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that re=
funds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in =
response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.=
 =20
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various f=
ilings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTO=
s in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocati=
ng, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO =
in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly=
.  Proceedings may be ordered.
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to=
 create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pend=
ing before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before Oct=
ober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation =
to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pe=
nding before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before O=
ctober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.

The 24-26 is OK with me.

I am on vacation Oct 5-21st - so I am available anytime between Oct 22nd through 31st.
So Dale I am available for the 24-26th.

Great work, team--we took the "total number of trips" category for the Bike Commute Challenge.

As a reward, we will be treated to lunch at Rock Bottom, courtesy of Enron, sometime during the month of October.

We need to pick a day when we can all get together for that lunch.

I propose one of the following dates, beginning at 11:45 a.m.:  

		T	W	Th	F

		16	17	18
			24	25	26

Please let me know which of these dates you CANNOT make.  If you have a strong preference about another date, let me know that, too.  The date(s) with the the highest possible attendance wins.

Let me know what your preference is.

You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahe=
ad DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would =
mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART off=
peak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand cor=
rectly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that i=
t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART t=
rade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?

Savita

What are your thoughts on this?

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Sean,

The language is below.  Also, Savita wanted to conference call you this aft=
ernoon to discuss this product.  What time is good for you?

Kevin

Kevin,

Could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the Mid-C p=
hysical product so I can work with it?  (I don't have an electronic copy).

Thanks

I am the one to talk with about this new product.  I will call you today to=

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL l=
egal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, bu=
t I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a =
financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For exampl=
e, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but tha=
t it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forwar=
d to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EO=
L, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical powe=
r, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice =
thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a pos=
ition to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it w=
ould provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead posi=
tion.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would a=
ppreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we ne=
ed to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contrac=
t language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

Let's talk about the RTO meetings when we get more information from FERC.  If the entire week is only going to be a panel format, I don't think it will be a very good use of Tim's or Sean's time.  In a panel setting, only the panelists are permitted to speak, and the audience can listen only -- participation from the audience is usually not allowed.  
 
Once we get more information from FERC and find out the exact format, we can then make final plans.

This time, I got the subject header right and include the attachment.  
 
 

Here's the notice on RTO Week.  No real details--they say they are forthcoming.
 
Note that Tim Belden and/or Sean Crandall from the West Desk are planning on attending part or all of the week.
 
Alan Comnes

My pick is New England.

I pick Washington.  I've mailed you my check today.

I haven't yet.  I will give him a buzz tonight.

Sean - Just wondering if you had talked with Matt about the possibilities with Sempra - I thought about calling and talking with him, but wanted to touch bases with you first.  Thanks, Serena

 
 
 

Kevin,

One more thing.  We'd like to get some more spreads going.  Specifically the PV/MC, the NP/SP, and the PV/SP.  I realize the PV/SP might be a problem from a legal standpoint because of contract language, but I would like to get the others going.  Can you give me a call some time today?

Thanks.

Kevin,

Could you e-mail me the contract language we currently have for the Mid-C physical product so I can work with it?  (I don't have an electronic copy).

Thanks

I am the one to talk with about this new product.  I will call you today to discuss.

Kevin

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

My name is Sean Crandall; I work with Jeff Richter.  I'll send you a check.
I'd like to pick the Bears as the losing team this week.

I'm not sure if my first response got through.  The person to talk to about this, this long of a term, is Mike Swerzbin.  If you have question concerning the short-term, let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Sean, thought you may have forgotten my name (I'm horrible w/ names, so I wouldn't blame you) in regards to the midC-Montana basis and wheeling from now to 2024.  I don't mean to pester.  Take care,

I have sent a justification for the PBA ($2K) to Amy (per her request).  She has sent it along to Houston.

What's the status with it???

It is perfect!

I will submit the request today and should know by the end of the week.

Amy

On August 16, 2001, Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.

The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.

As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that Cara receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.

Sean Crandall

(Amy.  Is this good enough?)

Fran,

I'm pretty sure I've already been hit for some of these.  If you could provide me a P&L copy from June 1 thru today (either electronic or paper) I'd appreciate it.

Sean and Diana:

Just wanna give you a heads up.  From Settlements we learned that there will be -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments in your book due to BPA and Modesto related deals .  I have researched on all the items and believe they are valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  If you don't disagree you shall expect to see this hit in your P&L for 8/31/01.

 << File: STNW PMA 083101.xls >> 

Please also note that there might be other items to come between now and the end of this month.  I will let you know when that happens.

Thanks,
Fran

Here's what changes:  COB:  We are not going to deliver to Midesto (Deal # 3689.4)
MC:  BPA deal # 51353 and Busbar BPA deal # 85098 are cancelled.

Sean,
 
Do the Feb. and March positions you sent this morning account for the termination of the two BPA contracts?  If not, can you send me a revised version when you get a chance?  I am not sure which BPA deals here are terminated and which ones are still good.  Thanks.

I heard about this.  Griswold was a weener.

Don't know if you saw this:

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced August 21 that it
filed and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against Avista
Energy, of Spokane, Washington, former Avista Energy Vice President of
Trading Thomas Johns of Spokane, Washington, and former Avista Energy trader
Michael T. Griswold of Seattle, Washington. In the Order issued today, the
CFTC finds that on four days between April 1998 and August 1998, Avista
Energy manipulated the settlement prices of the Palo Verde and
California-Oregon-Border electricity futures contracts traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), in order to increase the company's net
gain on certain over-the-counter option positions, whose value was based on
the settlement prices at issue. 
 
The CFTC imposed cease and desist orders against Avista Energy, Griswold,
and Johns, and required them to pay civil monetary penalties of $2.1
million, $110,000, and $50,000, respectively. The CFTC also imposed an
18-month trading ban on Griswold and a 12-month trading ban on Johns. The
settlements require Avista Energy, Griswold, and Johns to cooperate in any
further investigations and proceedings related to the conduct at issue.
Avista Energy, Griswold, and Johns consented to the entry of the orders
without admitting or denying the findings made in the orders. 
 
The CFTC also filed a ten-count complaint against former Avista Energy Vice
President of Trading Strategies William H. Taylor of Houston, Texas, former
Avista Energy trader Robert S. Kristufek of Chicago, Illinois, and NYMEX
floor broker Anthony J. DiPlacido of Bellmore, New York, charging them with
participating in the manipulative scheme.

We are 50 MW short at the Mid-Columbia during the offpeak hours for Monday (HE 01 thru HE 06, HE 23-24).  We are short to Portland General.  When you buy, put 25 MW in the Short-Term Northwest Book, and put the other 25 in the West Hourly BOM book.

Thank you very much.  I appreciate the quick response.

Sean:

I have been looking at the -$141K P&L hit in "Other Changes" on 8/13/01 you were inquiring about.  The biggest "contributor" of this hit is the restructured Modesto deal # 520328.3, which alone caused -$130K in Other Changes (a.k.a. 2nd Order in financial terms).  I believe what happened is that Matt re-marked the daily volatility curves down by a significant magnitude on 8/13/01 (* please see curve managers for the change).  Usually when volatilities changed drastically they would disrupt financial evaluation models and more likely to cause a change in deal value by factors which cannot be explained (i.e. Second Order).  This doesn't necessarily mean that the evaluation is incorrect but just that there will be some value change for which the models cannot pinpoint the reasons.

Anyway, for this basis option deal you lost $94K on 8/13, and this -$94K can be broken down into Curve Shift (-$19K), Gamma ($1.5K), Vega (70K), Theta (-16K), and Second Order/Other Changes (-$130K).    I looked at the curve change and interest rate change between 8/10 and 8/13 and they are relatively insignificant, but the drastic volatility mark down makes me feel that your losing money in this deal is somewhat consistent w/ what we should expect.  

I am still working with IT to see if we can nail this down to give you a more specific explanation.  In the mean time, if you have any thoughts or concerns, please feel free to let me know.

Thanks,
Fran

don't know what doing for new years (mentioned n.o. to z but not sure).  
didn't return phone call because i was in nyc and forgot when i got home.  i 
don't know anything about directories talk to my brother.  i don't know what 
the fuck.

what the fuck are you doing for new years? why the fuck didn't you return my
voice-mail? where in the fuck are those directories? what the fuck, man?

Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you 
should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I 
looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low 
Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with 
energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I 
don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up 
your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I 
don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look 
at some options when you are here for the wedding.

I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.  
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 
and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation 
from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.

Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy 
and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their 
daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to 
ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to 
grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew 
about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were 
cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the 
flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make 
it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what 
you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with 
tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our 
parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, 
we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.  
Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents 
standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican 
restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have 
things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys 
are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is 
that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay 
the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends 
to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and 
grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine 
at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way 
down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey 
and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there 
will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron 
of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick 
toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or 
Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.  
Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a 
reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am 
going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going 
on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could 
get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.  
Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad 
to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please 
call me tonight at the house.

     Hi Marty,

     Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan
     to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.
     Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for
     dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said
     she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or
     Zooey to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't
     want to detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.
     It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he
     would be fine while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey
     and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy
     would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer
     he doesn't come, just say so.  There will certainly be no hard
     feelings over it.

     I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not
     going to be able to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her
     boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the
     29th.  Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and
     should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.  Mike decided to fly
     and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.  There will be 9 or 11
     (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal
     dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay
     for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time and we
     can talk about it.

     Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.  She
     called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had
     really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to
     come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.

     Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I
     remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her
     class reunion.  I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time
     to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or
     whatever.  If you have time you can see the new house.  It is looking
     better every day.

     Love,

     Mom

The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of 
tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is 
buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.  If you are interested in the 
9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you 
for $305.  Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the 
weekend.  You can reach me at work or anytime this weekend on my cell phone.  
If you are interested please call me at 713-853-5933 (work) or 713-516-8820 
(cell) and we will work it out.  FYI - I am also notifying the person who bid 
$305 and promised to give them first look but otherwise the tickets are your 
if you want.

Thanks,

Martin

Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this 
year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have 
until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You 
should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points 
you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone 
bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will 
have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 
100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for 
highest score and 12 points for lowest score).  

I am interested in purchasing a Huglu shotgun and would like to get a price.  
I am looking at the Model Au1 semi-automatic model.  Please email me with a 
price and approximate time til delivery (I live in Houston).  Also, please 
include information on any choices or extras available.

Thanks,

Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term 
shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 
under this year
and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for 
were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings 
based on where
the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next 
summer to be trading over $4.55

Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is 
still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already).  
Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going 
to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed 
to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other 
things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also 
I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from 
Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but 
wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  

Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me 
know.

Love

Hubby

Police follow naked man to pot crop 
  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>
  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>
By Brian Kelly 
Herald Writer 

CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living, police said Wednesday. 

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island. 

The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out. 

When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana. 

According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed. 

In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation." 

Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants. 

Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer. 

In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people." 

The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo. 

Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything. 

Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles. 

The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North Carolina after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North Carolina company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.  
 
Thanks,

I sent an email to the prez of Star about the furniture and cancelled our purchase from Furniture USA.  The said we should get a cedit on our credit card in 5 days.  Hopefully I will hear from him soon and we will have spankin' new furniture!

Hello Mr. Cuilla,

information that I am needing to update. I am attaching a sheet that would
be very helpful if you could fill it out. In filling this out, this will
help us in finding the right opportunity for the right candidate. If you

Kayvan,
 
Attached is a copy of my resume.  Things are very volatile over here so I am not sure what to expect for the next three months, but if possible (and if Enron isn't banktrupt) I would like to stay here until Febuary 5.  If we are around until then, I would like to try to make a choice on a potential job by early January.  Of course if we go bankrupt everything could change.  I would like to come up sometime soon and see what options exist and how I could fit into AEP's plans.  It was good talking to you and I hope to hear from you soon.
 
Thanks,
 
Martin

Mike,
 
Please call me if you have any questions or opportunities

i would imagine as soon as we are flat but not sure

you guys taking down #'s @ 9:45 today or is that rumor?

Kayvan

I would like to talk to you as soon as possible about my trading opportunities with AEP.  Let me know if you have any time today or tomorrow.  I am busy from 3pm to 6pm but available any other time.

Thanks,

Martin

you guys taking down #'s @ 9:45 today or is that rumor?

We got home too late last night to call you, but I wanted to tell you what a
wonderful evening we had and thank you for being such a thoughtful son.
Drillion was just great.  I have never seen anything like it!  After seeing
Drillion a regular circus would be dull and boring.

The Old Warsaw was everything you described and more.  Fur coats and big
diamonds are still in style and I saw plenty of them at the Warsaw.   The
service was impeccable, the music was soothing and relaxing, and I've never
eaten a better meal.  Dad had the lobster thermador and I had the
tenderloin.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  The young man at the table
next to us proposed to his girlfriend and the ring was hidden under grapes
in a silver goblet.  It was very romantic and the staff made a big
production of it so we all enjoyed it.

I wanted to call you this morning to thank you but I know things are in
turmoil at work and I didn't want to disturb you.  We will call this
evening.

Your wonderful gift was very much appreciated and enjoyed by both Dad and I.

Love,

Doesn't make a lot of sense.  We don't have any offices in Dallas that I am aware of and his name or anything closely resembling it is not in our employee listings.

	Hey, do you know Phillip at all?  One of the Bell lawyers that Dad
talks to says he is pals with him and would talk to him about me if need be
... Wif

Zooey name of Enron lawyer we talked about yesterday is Phillip Islip.
Believe he is based up here in Dallas if that makes sense.  Love Dad.   See
you Friday night. 

well all that you can lose is 11

 	 Scientists kill mice with dance music
  <http://images.thisislondon.com/img/spacer.gif>
by Danielle Demetriou 

Scientists who forced drugged mice to endure fatal doses of loud dance music have been accused of " despicable" cruelty by animal welfare campaigners. 

The study by Cambridge University examined how loud music strengthens the harmful effects of methamphetamine, the drug commonly known as speed. 

Wendy Higgins of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, said: "These sick experiments are absolutely despicable. Just because people choose to take drugs and go to raves doesn't justify subjecting animals to suffering and death in a laboratory." 

The scientists, who used a total of 238 mice in the experiment, concluded that loud music strengthened the toxic effects of methamphetamine in animals.

Have my options and restricted stock been set yet?

you know i am torn - I took OU against A&M at minus 17 but that was in OK.  Sagarin actually has the line at 5 which is a bit of a surprise and the game is in Lubbock.  Not sure if I am going to bet it or not

Martin should I be emailing you at martin.cuilla@dynegy.com - Are you
betting the house on OU this weekend

Did you get in as much trouble as I did this weekend - Lori seems to think
I need to get help - I told her it's normal to drink all day at a bar, then
go to dinner where you don't know half the people there and proceed to get
extremely fucked up

I've thought about you a few times in the last few months, didn't want to intrude upon an already bad situation with my bullshit questions.  I'm hearing some pretty depressing stuff from the people I know at ENE.
 
I wish I had the capital to open my own shop?there will be talent and opportunity a plenty on the market soon.  I'll ask around?I've got some friends at Duke and Dynegy from B-school, the Gianoucous (spelling??) brothers (John and Dimitri?from elementary school) started their own outfit a while back, and my old man is at Schlumberger and has good contacts in general (if you aren't married to a trading environment).
 
Give me a few days, and I'll be in touch.
 
Michael

Men Using Viagra With 'Club Drugs'

Doctors say gay and straight men who are getting Viagra and combining it with "club drugs" like ecstasy may be risking their lives.

Large numbers of homosexual men, and a smaller number of heterosexuals, are combining Viagra with illicit drugs to achieve a potentially deadly "sexual high," a new study finds. 

The men combine the popular impotence drug with illicit "club drugs" such as ecstasy, ketamine, amphetamines, GHB, and "poppers." 

The study, discussed last week at the Centers for Disease Control's HIV ( news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22HIV%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=HIV>) Prevention Conference, focuses on high-risk behavior among gay men who use Viagra to heighten their sexual experience. 

San Francisco epidemiologist Andrea Kim, who conducted the study, says it and other studies in California and London have shown that "gay men are combining Viagra with other drugs much more frequently when compared to heterosexual men" and that puts them at higher risk. Her sa common side effect of club drugs is loss of erection. 

"We know that ecstasy and methamphetamines reduce sexual function, so the men are using Viagra to enhance their sexual ability," Kim says. 

Partygoers often combine Viagra with amyl nitrite, an inhaled stimulant commonly referred to as "poppers." 

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Chief of Toxicology and emergency room physician Dr. Daniel Keyes says that "amyl nitrite makes the heart race and combining these drugs can cause cardiac events." 

Like Viagra, amyl nitrite causes blood vessel dilation and a drop in blood pressure. Combining two blood pressure lowering drugs can be fatal if a person has a heart attack or stroke. 

Although rare, another medical condition that can occur is priapism, a severely painful problem that can result in permanent damage caused by the penis being erect for many hours.

Police follow naked man to pot crop 
  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>

By Brian Kelly 
Herald Writer 

CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living, police said Wednesday. 

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island. 

The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out. 

When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana. 

According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed. 

In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation." 

Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants. 

Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer. 

In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people." 

The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo. 

Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything. 

Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles. 

The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

Trading one silver car for another - silver car with black interior

He said he would probably sell it around 28K which is probably $3,000-$4,000 below what you would pay new.
I'll probably have a little room but below 28K I'll probably just move it back to Calgary. Let me know if you want to see it. I car pool with Benson so I only have it here every other day.

Looks like new ones are going for $31,000 - what is your real offer.  My wife is looking for a new car so I am seriously interested.

fuck them bizzzitches - i gots a passport 8500 arriving thursday.  on the serious side - if you are really interested about that car i guess we should go to sterling mccall and test drive one and check it out.  it is better to go there so you can find out what the new ones go for and if you are really getting a good deal.  let me know.

	Oh man, will this apply to us.  Better set that cruise control!

Hey Man!

Just got back from my climbing trip.  Headed out to the Canary Islands for 
10 days then I?ll be coming over to the states on the 21st or so.  Needless 
to say, not going to be able to have you over.  Wish you could have come 
over sooner when Donny and Vinlarek were here it was great.  I?m not going 
anywhwere and will be here next summer and the one afeter that and the one 
after that....  Don?t know when you need to use your vacation time by, but 
maybe we can go sking this winter.

Like I said, I will be in Texas from the 21st to the 1st of October or so, 
then off to Maine to see my aunt.  Hopefully we?ll see each other ( I need 
to get my shit out of your closet and into my storage place anyways!!, 
Thanks and sorry about that!)

Say hi to Zooey for me and see you in a few weeks hopefully.

I called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 9.95.  After 6 months, the rate goes to 12.95 - they charged us for hbo, showtime, and cinemax which should be 16.95 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax.  I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge.  Going forward the package will be 16.95 or we can cancel cinemax and save 4.00 a month.

Attached is the Request for Bid (RFB) on various physical packages of
natural gas from Eagle Gas Marketing Company (Eagle), Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma.  If interested in any or all of the packages shown, we would
like to receive a bid on or before the due date Tuesday September 11,
2001.  If you do not handle bidding on a particular package, please make
sure this e-mail or the form gets to the individual in your company that
handles supply bids on the pipelines shown. Eagle is a reliable supplier
of physical natural gas in the Mid-Continent, E. Texas and S. Texas
regions.

If  you should have any questions in regards to this RFB or did not
receive the attachment (Excel spreadsheet), please contact Eagle at
(405) 557-9475 or 1-800-332-9400 Ext. 482 (Outside Oklahoma).

i have to set it up in sportsline.com - i'll have it done before the end of the day

Do we have a website?

I talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in (before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.  They call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check for the difference.  We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we can go pick up the Lexus from Dorland.

how much do you want to bet?

Do you want to make a wager on the Horn's record this year?

I am proposing that we will not lose more than two games this year (regular and bowl).

Late,
GM

who much is the m1 field as well.  thanks for your help.

The SBE in camo does EVERYTHING.

How much is the Montefeltro and the Legacy - I assume they can shoot 2
3/4 to 3 inch.  Which would you recommend (between Montefeltro, Legacy
and Super Black Eagle) - I mainly hunt pheasant and quail but would also
like a gun that I can hunt ducks and geese with.  Since I plan to hunt
some ducks and geese should I get a camo gun?  Any other suggestions or
recommedations?

i am sorry one more - the sport - i just can't make up my mind which model to get

 God Finally Gives Shout-Out Back To All His Niggaz <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/head_god_gives_shout-out.gif>

      SOUTH BRONX, NY-The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz.

 	   <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out.jpg>	
Above: Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God (inset). 	

      "Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years," said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. "I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew."

      "All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz," the Lord added.

      As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.

      "Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan," the deity said. "These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased."

      Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.

      In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.

      God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.

      "For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you," God said. "All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible."

  <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg>	 	
Above: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord. 	

      As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.

      "Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch," the Lord said. "For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt."

      Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.

      "God sees even the smallest sparrow fall," said Dr. Cornell West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. "The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all."

      The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they "feelin' Him."

      "God is the Original," Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. "The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike."

      Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word "nigga." On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His "shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word." Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.

      Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.

      "The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it," rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. "Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him."

      "God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters," rapper Ice Cube said. "But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat."

Late,
GM

Any truth to rumor that Whitney Houston died of an overdose?

 

There is a very good website for getting information regarding current events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.
Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life!
U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah 
 
SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But the official said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East.

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness." 

A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the
government proves he is responsible, rather than send hate mail & cause
added tension between the two countries!

Don't be so ignorant!  It's UN-American!

Whoever is responsible will be taken care of - we don't need to take it upon
ourselves.

Nice...

Here is another good one.

only problem is his recommendation is that we do nothing and the american people won't stand for that and if we don't do something bin laden will surely strike again.

I got the non-compete agreement from Hunter today - 10K raise to 90K and 50K cash bonus with 75K stock/option bonus.  I'll bring it home so you can look it over. After I sign it we will get check either at end of this month or 15th of next month

i am sorry i forwarded to Souad Mahmassani - i trade eastern canada not the midcontinent

Have you had a chance to look into this?  Robert Hills with KCS is wanting payment for this deal.  Thank you.

Jeanne

Martin,
	This Sitara deal #270180 ends in June 2001.  However, I received an invoice from KCS for July production at meter #36381.  At Edwards #2-19 they are invoicing me for a total of 62 MMBtu, and at Russell #1-20 they are invoicing me for 124 MMBtu.  Should this deal have been extended to include July, or is there another deal out there?  These deals do not show up in Unify.  Please advise.  Thank you.

	Yeah - already gave everyone the lowdown on the price break.
Apparently, that is purely an internet special because Nicole tried to call
and they were quoting $340.00.  Either that, or we just got lucky as hell

If I would have kept my whole EOG position it would be worth 80,000 right now.  If I would have kept half - 55,000 or a brand new bmw 540.  Instead we have an IS 300.

This picture was taken by a tourist atop the World Trade Center. His camera was found in the rubble, he has not yet been found.  

  

I had an extremely rude conversation with a manager at southwestern bell and they once again said we weren't owed anything at which time I told the woman she didn't know what the fuck she was talking about.  After several other uses of fuck she hung up.  I switched our service to att (never thought i would be happy to be an att customer again) and called back and got another manager who claims she is taking care of it.

is very tempting it is also very dangerous. =20

Oh shit - what did missy say??

I don't know if this is going to keep its format but EOG's trailing
earning are $5.01 and forward expectations are $2.31 and that probably
is too high.  Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is
14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average
of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a
$2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are
going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which
would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to
wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then
maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from
trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or
more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the
bottom.

Wasssup.  I just got back from vacation so still trying to catch up.  I would love to go to lunch but I have not been allowed to go to lunch for two years.  I work on the trading floor - trading natural gas - and thanks to the lovely invention of EnronOnLine (our online trading program) we have lunch delivered in everyday and aren't allowed to leave.  It sounds great at first - free lunch everyday but trust me you grow to hate it.  Regardless we should go for a beer sometime soon.  Give me a call and we'll go for a happy hour.  x35933

Storey and I were talking about different places to look for coverages and insurance for death (regarding his father).  Were are some of the non standard (ie not life insurance) coverages that he should make sure he has checked.  His dad was on a business trip from Houston to NY.  

Hey I want to check with you about pulling $750 from our checking account to deposit into my gambling account.  No I have not lost $1,000 but I am following a model and I take all the games it says and there are more than 20 games each week which eats up all the capital until the games are decided.  I know the next question and so far I have lost $150 but I didn't take any games this week because there wasn't enough to bet all of them and I would have won $150.  Anyway, I would like to know if there are any big checks coming otherwise I am going to pulse and get things set up for this weekend.  On a side note, the furniture people called and said the furniture is coming in in pieces and they should have it all by November which means it would ship to us between the 1st and 3 week of November but definitely before Thanksgiving.

I reported on our message boards Monday night about the "Janikowski
Shenanigans" with him falling down at a night club resulting in a cut to his
head requiring stitches.   Chris Mortensen reported the Raider brass were
simply calling it "Sebastian being Sebastian".   Coach Jon Gruden joked that
he was just "glad he fell on his head and not his leg".   Most sort of
shrugged it off as "those crazy Raiders".

But now it's getting a little more serious with this CNNSI article:
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/10/09/raiders_janikowski
_ap/

Janikowski Hurt in Fall After "Apparent Drug Overdose"

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Oakland Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski fell at a
nightclub due to "an apparent drug overdose," cutting his face and requiring
five stitches a few hours after the Raiders' game against Dallas, police
said Tuesday.

Janikowski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the Sno-Drift Bar
reported he had collapsed early Monday morning, police spokesman Dewayne
Tully said.

Janikowski, 23, who attended team meetings later Monday, was not arrested,
Tully said. A police report indicated the club's doorman told officers that
Janikowski was "possibly overdosing on GHB" -- the so-called date-rape drug.

Last April in Florida, Janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug
possession and evidence tampering after being accused of possessing GHB.

In the police report Monday, officers wrote they "found Janikowski
incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor. As a result of the
uncontrolled flailing, Janikowski hit his head on the floor and caused a cut
over his right eye."

Janikowski did not respond when officers talked to him, and he was placed in
soft restraints on a gurney for the trip to the hospital, the police report
said.

Janikowski's roommate, Jay Hoffman, told police the kicker was not taking
drugs but that he was with an unidentified woman earlier in the night who
may have slipped something into his drink.

Other witnesses at the club told police they saw Janikowski voluntarily
taking what appeared to be GHB earlier in the evening.

Paul Healy, the kicker's agent, said Janikowski needed stitches for a head
wound. He said his client had been drinking, and said reports of a drug
overdose were "totally false."

"I know he was out there at a nightclub in San Francisco and slipped and
fell. At a lot of these clubs, people spill their drinks, and he slipped and
whacked his head," Healy said. "You don't have a drug overdose Sunday night
and go to practice Monday morning."

Asked about the police report, Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said Tuesday
the team would have no comment.

Raiders coaches said Janikowski appeared fine Monday. The kicker, who has
made all eight of his field goals this season, was not in the locker room in
the hour that reporters are allowed access on days following games.

Janikowski, a native of Poland, was Oakland's first-round choice in the 2000
draft after starring at Florida State.

In June 2000, Janikowski was acquitted on a charge he offered a Tallahassee
policeman $300 to release his roommate after an argument with a bouncer who
wouldn't let him into a local nightclub.

His contract includes a clause that will force him to pay back about $25,000
for every game he misses due to suspension. The clause was added because of
his run-ins with the law.

First thing - nothing has been proven.   It's important to note we're
talking about allegations here.   But clearly, this isn't as funny now.   He
likely skates here without too much trouble but it's probably a sign that
you need a "plan B" if Janikowski is your kicker.   Just to be safe.   More
as we hear it.

I am not sure if Enron's Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00

sorry i plan on squandering all that money and more all to get a few prints that favor my positions.  damn it sucks going on vacations!

Jason,
Hey man just wanting to see what's going on. From what I've heard you've 
been doing an okay job with my P&L. Only been able to check the market a 
couple of times-it doesn't look like too much has happened. How's the Mid 
Continent? Can't wait to get back-I hope you didn't take my job back. I'm 
here at the London School of Economics and their sytems won't aallow me to 
get on enrononline. Well, have a fun trip down to Beaurevage(sp?) see you I 
guess on Tues.(I'll be there Mon) Tell Martin not to lose all of that P&L 
you made me seeing how he is trading on triple coupon day.

Later,
Denver

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having?

About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).  

On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.  

On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.  

The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.  

Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.  

Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this.

In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues.

Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?  

Thanks again for all your help this weekend.......

Regards

Bharat

bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the be=

g are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn'=
t say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool=
 about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are =
going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I wal=

eaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to =
email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls=
.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like an=
d she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you coul=
d say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs. =
 It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that=
 i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weeke=

is very tempting it is also very dangerous. =20

Oh shit - what did missy say??

I don't know if this is going to keep its format but EOG's trailing
earning are $5.01 and forward expectations are $2.31 and that probably
is too high.  Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is
14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average
of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a
$2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are
going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which
would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to
wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then
maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from
trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or
more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the
bottom.

When does the cash portion of my signing bonus get paid.  I thought it was the first pay period after it was signed but maybe I am confused.  Also, since the raise was effective starting Sept. 1, will they issue a separate check for the difference between the base salary?

I got this email from a guy I talk to occationally in Canada - I didn't know they were getting married

Martin,
Apparently you live right next door to friends of mine.  Dana Welsh and Gerald King were neighbors of mine when I lived in Houston in 1998, and my wife and I still keep in contact with them.  As a matter of fact, we'll be staying with them on November 11 & 12 before their wedding, and might knock on your door to meet you.  Funny, Dana mentioned in the past you worked for Enron, but it's such a big company I didn't think I might know you.

Business&Finance: ESB ownership of network is questioned - Competition 
Authority says separation of national grid from core company does not go far 
enough. Arthur Beesley reports 
  
11/13/2000 
Irish Times 
18 
Copyright (C) 2000 Irish Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) 

The Competition Authority has questioned the ESB's ownership of the 
electricity network in the newly deregulated power market.

In a paper submitted to the Department of Public Enterprise, the body said 
the separation of the ESB's National Grid operation from the core company did 
not go far enough to ensure fair competition. 

It said arguments in favour of the ESB retaining the transmission and 
distribution system ignored the 'overwhelming conclusion' that a generation 
company which owns such assets 'will naturally favour itself' at the expense 
of customers and reliability.

The paper has not been published yet. It is believed to state, however, that 
the ESB's retention of its 'non-competitive' transmission and distribution 
assets and its 'competitive' electricity generation business was unwise from 
a competition perspective.

The National Grid, which controls when individual power stations feed 
electricity into the network, was separated from the ESB when 27 per cent of 
the market was opened last February.

In theory, this meant the ESB could not favour its own generation stations 
over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and 
off as demand for power fluctuates.

But the authority's response to the Statutory Instrument behind the 
separation - which renamed the National Grid as Eirgrid - said more should be 
done to ensure the market operates fairly.

The paper said: 'Some argue that as long as there is an independent operator 
of the underlying transmission system, ownership of the transmission system 
can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator.

'In accordance with this line of argument, the shift of operational control 
of electricity transmission to Eirgrid would mean that discrimination in 
dispatch [of power] and other operations would not be possible. However, the 
Competition Authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming 
conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will 
naturally favour itself.'

The Statutory Instrument followed complex talks, which led to an agreement 
between the ESB, its trade unions and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ms 
O'Rourke.

When Eirgrid was formed, the ESB retained ownership and responsibility to 
develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the 
low-voltage local distribution network.

The authority says these, too, should be separated from the ESB to ensure the 
competitive market functions fairly, according to a person familiar with its 
paper.

This would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective, 
transparent, non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in 
the market, it said.

The paper argues the ESB has an incentive to allocate as many costs as 
possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system.

Greetings.  The reference is specific to statements that we made when FERC 
first issued it's proposed order on Nov. 1 regarding how to fix the mess in 
California.  We said (and FERC was a little cranky about this) that we were 
pulling 300 MWs of power plants that we'd planned to build in California on 
the basis of the price cap proposal included in FERC's proposed order.  It 
was in the press.  So it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals.  
Calpine subsequently announced that it, too, would pull the peaking plants it 
had planned to developed.  I think that they announced the same amount would 
be pulled---300 MWs.

If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call.

Best,
Jeff

     FERC's sole Republican commissioner will not be attending
today's hearings in San Diego, saying the situation has gotten
too political, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
     Commissioner Curt Herbert was quoted as saying: "California
would rather fight this out for the next five to ten years rather
than take steps now to solve the problem." He also expects
additional companies to join Enron Corp. and Calpine Corp. in
pulling out of the state's market, causing blackouts and ongoing
high prices next summer. "We've had three hearings already,"
Herbert added. "Are customers better off? I don't think so."
     Meanwhile, State senator Debra Bowen, head of the state
Senate Energy Committee, told a hearing in Sacramento yesterday
that FERC's plan could lead to re-regulation if residents were
not protected from market manipulation. Reuters quotes Bowen as
saying: "If there's not political accountability between the
people that are making the decisions about what California
customers pay and the people who are paying those rates, we're
likely to have a revolution at the consumer level that leads to
re-regulation regardless of what's in a FERC order" (Dow Jones
Newswires, Reuters, Nov. 13).

 - GOVERNOR DAVIS CALLS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION TO ORDER 
CONSUMER REFUNDS AND PRICE CAPS.htm

Thanks for the heads up.

I would like to attend the event with Secretary Summers.

Hi Lisa:
Just got a call from Rick.  He said that 1) The meeting needs to be in San 
Francisco. 2) The meeting needs to be on Dec. 5th. (Not the 29th or the 30th, 
as previously requested). 3) The meeting is mandatory.  I'll leave a message 
for Paul, too.  If you have any questions, just give a ring.  

Best,
Jeff

Any luck getting on Mike's calendar.

FYI:  His name is spelled Mike Bentivoglio.

Please forward this to Rick's group.  Thanks.

Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful 
information that can be used at the state PUC level, including information on 
the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute 
to lack of price caps following the summer 1998 price spikes; better 
preparation for summer 2000 through the use of forward contracts and 
transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from 
particular markets.

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.

Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Cathy Van Way called asking my view on some names she'd been given to invite 
to the hearing.  (I continue to cajole Jessie Knight to appear.)  During the 
call, she mentioned that the committee intends to invite Steve Kean and that 
she needed someone to email here Steve's vitals so that they could write a 
letter inviting him. 

that's great.  glad to hear it.  no thanks necessary.  see you tomorrow.

In Staff's report on its investigation of the bulk power markets in the east, 
the Midwest report notes on page 2-15, Additions to Capacity, that new 
generation has been added in the Midwest region, and that some market 
participants believe that developers sited new generation in the Midwest 
because there were no price caps.  

Steve Kean suggested that we refer to this finding in our November 20 
comments on the California order and specifically draw the conclusion that no 
price caps leads to more generation development.

The Midwest report is attached.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Got a call from Rick.  Scheduling issues now make it necessary to have the 
meeting in San Francisco on Dec. 5th at 9 AM.  Rick asked that folks make the 
meeting a priority.

Professor Michaels, 

Further to the voicemail message I left for you today regarding speaking 
early next year at the IPPSA Conference in Banff, Alberta the details are: 

Topic: The California Experience - Lessons that Alberta Can Learn From (or 
something like this title - although I was unable to open the presentation on 
your website entitled" "California's Electrical Disaster and the Furture of 
Competitive Power" I would expect based on this title that much of what is in 
that presentation would be of interest to those attending the IPPSA 
Conference. 

Date: Monday March 19, 2001 13:00 - 13:30 (Conference is 2 full days - March 
19-20, 2001)

Reimbursements: Travel (economy class) and one night at Rimrock Hotel.  Also 
free conference registration (which includes meals during conference).

Deadline for presentation materials so they can be included in the conference 
binder: February 28, 2001

Conference Information: the conference is held at the Rimrock Hotel in Banff, 
Alberta and has been sold out the last three years.  It will attract about 
400 delegates in 2001 from across Canada and the U.S. with the majority of 
the delegates being generation developers, large consumers, marketers, and 
policy makers from Western Canada. The speakers include a number of respected 
academics/consultants from across North America, senior industry 
representatives, senior government representatives, and senior 
representatives from the Alberta Transmission Administrator and Power Pool of 
Alberta. 

I look forward to your reply.  My telephone number is (403) 974-6746.

Regards,

Rob Hemstock

Can't thank you enough.  Great report and I wish that I'd been there with you 
to experience it.  I'd like to stay in touch.  It's a high priority of mine 
to come down there (as I've mentioned a few times).  I'm going to try and do 
it before the month's out.  I hope we can have lunch or something and compare 
notes about all this stuff.  This won't be going away for quite some time.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi, Jeff --

I'm so glad you called today and that I could run over to the FERC 
meeting.  Always interesting!

Here are my notes -- I apologize in advance if they are a little 
rough.  Over the past few years I've become a much faster typist than when 
I write longhand.

Gov. Gray Davis
November 14, 2000
FERC Hearing in San Diego

Serious flaws in the energy market in California.  Rates are not reasonable 
nor just.  Two points:

1.  Given FERC's findings, you must order refunds. If you don't, then what 
was the point of the findings.  Believes FERC has the authority to issue 
the refunds and called on them to order them sooner than later.
2.  Impose hard price caps and big caps that will protest consumers from 
another anticipated crisis in summer 2001.

Davis said he believes that deregulation can work eventually, if market is 
competitive and all parties act responsibly.  But he believes it will take 
4-5 years to get to a competitive market.  Without the price caps, he 
believes there will be a lot of unwarranted pain inflicted on the consumers 
and businesses of CA.

He said there is no justification for the huge profits the energy companies 
netted in the third quarter.  He said he won't stand to allow CA companies 
to be brought to their knees.  The market is dysfunctional.  People in SD 
believe the marketplace is being manipulated for obscene profits.  Wants to 
level off dereg for 4-5 years to allow market to work and for more power 
plants to come online.

He said he believes in people making money and that dereg can work -- but 
only when it's competitive.

Strong belief in wholesale price caps.  Angry that FERC stripped CA ISO's 
ability to protect consumers against price spikes.  He said FERC's plan is 
a reckless deregulation experiment and that the Commission's plan will only 
make things worse next summer. Davis asked FERC to modify its order.

He said that FERC doesn't believe that CA can get the plants 
online.  Doesn't blame them given the history of CA, but that he has taken 
measures to speed up from 1 year to 6 months to site new plants.  He's 
allocated $50 million from the general fund and $500 million for demand 
reduction, renewables and conservation programs.  He believes he can reduce 
demand and increase supply without public health risks or environmental 
degradation.

He said he wants to have someone accountable/electable to the ISO and the 
Power Exchange Boards, that the state should have the right to include 
people from CA on those Boards.  He talked about the negative effects the 
actions in CA will have on other states watching this "great deregulation 
experiment."

He said FERC's proposed solution does nothing to lower prices.  To the 
contrary, it's to bring businesses and consumers to their knees.  And Davis 
predicted "a ratepayers revolt that will strip FERC of its authority and 
take matters into their own hands."  He said he believes strongly that FERC 
has the remedies to protect consumers, give them rebates and prevent this 
from happening again.

He said if FERC just focuses on getting more plants online, all hell is 
going to break loose. That FERC can't sit in Washington, 3,000 miles away 
and take action on CA -- that will only cause more problems.

Dana speaking again --  If any of this doesn't make sense or you have 
additional questions, please let me know. I have a few things scribbled in 
the margins that may help piece it together better.

Again, thanks for the opportunity to help.  I look forward to talking to 
you again soon.

Best,

Dana

I'll take a wild guess about what will be in the plan.

1. Marshall Law
2. Nationalize the grid.
3. International energy crimes trial.

No rumors from the AB 1890 group either.  Seems like the plan is being 
developed by a select few and very close to the vest.

The Governor obviously picked Dec 1 so they could review everyone's filings 
from the 22nd.  I've asked our lobbying firm -- governmental Advocates -- to 
see what they can find out about the plan.  I haven't even heard any rumors.

Dr. Littlechild.  

I'm very disappointed that our schedules seemed to pass in the night.  I had 
an engagement on Monday night, which regrettably kept me from having dinner 
with the speakers.  And Tuesday I was traveling.  I tried to call the 
Claremont and had a dreadful time trying to leave you a message.  If you 
haven't left the states yet, I would very much like to get together.  
Otherwise, I'll just have to come to London.  I understand that David Teece 
has filled you in on our discussions.  Would like to discuss that futher with 
you.  It was a great pleasure to meet you, however briefly, and I hope that 
our paths cross again very soon.

All the best,
Jeff

Sorry we missed last night. I was expecting to see you at the dinner. I 
should like to visit the office if there is time. My constraints today are 
lecture at Berkeley 12.30 to 2pm, and they suggest I should be there around 
11.30 beforehand. Also a request to meet someone from STG consulting, with 
whom I am doing some work, probably in Menlo Park, and an invitation to 
dinner in Berkeley area. I had thought we might meet this morning before the 
lecture, but probably too late now. Could do afterwards, en route to Menlo 
Park? I am at Claremont Hotel until around 11.15, tel 510 843 3000 room 325. 
Am in Business Centre on Hotmail at present but computer's a bit slow here.

Has anyone talked with Tim B about what Larcamp said -- ie the soft cap only 
applies to PX and ISO bids and not to any bilateral contracts including 
bilateral fwd contracts?  
	Donna Fulton
	11/14/2000 09:33 AM
		
Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for 
issues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.   
Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey 
is not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward 
market.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing 
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24 
months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage 
of their needs from this contract.
A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market 
(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that 
generation not be cancelled in California.
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the 
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what 
is opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact, 
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater 
incentive to sell elsewhere.
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not 
eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be 
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues 
and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be 
only for one month).
Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission 
should not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was 
one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied 
to the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet 
the 5% test.
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's 
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their 
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation 
before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of 
today.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include 
stranded costs.
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be 
changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A 
Court battle was threatened.

There are a few other issues we need to look into:

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I 
suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
"exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it 
through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.  
Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we 
should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward.
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible).
Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, 
acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of 
issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our 
comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have 
already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply 
cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I 
haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.

B.O.  you hearing any reviews?  i think it opened this week, or last week?  
And I think Cameron's got it right, you guys on the 29th, me and P. Dub-yah 
on the 6th.  Hey, I saw the menu that Nancy sent around.  Is she cooking on 
her own birthday?

Jeff,
Sorry I've been hard to get a hold of... we held a workshop today to talk 
about our proposed Transport Options program.  I found a copy of what I'd 
sent to you before.  I'll stand behind these numbers today as representing 
the dollar value of the risk Transwestern faced in the proceeding.  What's 
not clear from my original note is that these cost impacts were annual, and 
such impacts would continue year to year thereafter until 
conditions/circumstances changed.  I hope this is useful.

Jeffery Fawcett
03/06/2000 04:40 PM
Jeff,
You asked me to try to quantify the impact of Transwestern losing access 
rights to 200 MMcf/d of capacity at SoCal Needles as part of the GIR 
proceeding.  Unfortunately, it's not a precise science inasmuch as it depends 
on the shippers' reaction and/or retaliation to such circumstances.  As a 
baseline, Transwestern is almost fully subscribed under various term length 
contracts (and has been since 1998) to the California Border, including the 
750 MMcf/d of capacity available at SoCal Needles.  

In concept, under SFV rates, the majority of revenues would otherwise be 
realized by TW, notwithstanding the circumstance of TW shippers being denied 
full access to their primary delivery point.  In this "best case," the loss 
to TW would be the commodity rates (theoretically, a wash, since they 
presumably represent the true variable cost of TW providing the service), and 
the revenue benefit associated with the fuel margin, calculated to be $5.8MM.

If TW shippers took the position that TW was responsible, and therefore, 
accountable for their inability to consumate a portion of their transactions 
into SoCal Gas' system, then TW faces a "more onerous case" in which it loses 
the demand charge component of their contracts calculated to be $16.5MM.  
Coupled with the aforementioned fuel margin, the total loss is $22.3MM. 

In the worst case, in addition to the actual damages or costs to TW's 
shippers described above, TW shippers may face performance penalties or other 
contractual damages involving their commodity sales to customers behind SoCal 
Gas.  Therfore, TW shippers may attempt to extract those same penalties and 
costs from TW.

Realistically, I'd say that TW faces a loss somewhere between the best case 
and the more onerous case, maybe in the $12 - $15MM range.

I hope this information is useful for purposes of your analysis.  Let me know 
if I can be of any further assistance.

Meeting from 11:30 to 12:30 but otherwise available.

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their 
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp 
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce 
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. 
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to 
shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were 
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel 
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San 
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow 
new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies 
last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to 
solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, 
they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical 
problem and into a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single 
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a 
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating plants 
and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, chief 
executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the 
organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  "You 
can't look at these things in isolation." 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company, 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of 
industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In 
California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas, 
and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating 
plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the 
older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't 
like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they 
burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power  
plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short 
of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including 
many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair 
after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to 
begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and 
not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because 
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last 
summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of 
gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices 
also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal 
units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8% 
from a year ago. 

"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said 
High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In 
California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the 
price a year earlier. 

Lisa:  Sorry, but Joseph's gone on vacation for the week.  I think that the 
size of the group is going to require that we do this offsite.  We use the 
"Park Hyatt" in San Francisco.  Could you check with Paul and let him know 
that I think that we need to go offsite, given the size of the crowd, and if 
he agrees, could you go ahead and check into getting a room at the Park 
Hyatt?  As always, I'm greatly indebted.  If there are any problems, or if 
you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call.

something like this title - although I was unable to open the presentation on 
your website entitled" "California's Electrical Disaster and the Furture of 
Competitive Power" I would expect based on this title that much of what is in 
that presentation would be of interest to those attending the IPPSA 
Conference. 

Date: Monday March 19, 2001 13:00 - 13:30 (Conference is 2 full days - March 
19-20, 2001)

Reimbursements: Travel (economy class) and one night at Rimrock Hotel.  Also 
free conference registration (which includes meals during conference).

Deadline for presentation materials so they can be included in the conference 
binder: February 28, 2001

Conference Information: the conference is held at the Rimrock Hotel in Banff, 
Alberta and has been sold out the last three years.  It will attract about 
400 delegates in 2001 from across Canada and the U.S. with the majority of 
the delegates being generation developers, large consumers, marketers, and 
policy makers from Western Canada. The speakers include a number of respected 
academics/consultants from across North America, senior industry 
representatives, senior government representatives, and senior 
representatives from the Alberta Transmission Administrator and Power Pool of 
Alberta. 

I look forward to your reply.  My telephone number is (403) 974-6746.

Hi -- I'd very much like to stay in touch as well.  I just finished 
speaking with Rep. Dan Schaefer -- he called to see how I was holding up in 
all of this election mess.  He confirmed what you said: this thing is only 
getting started.  I told him about Jesse Knight's initiative in San Diego 
to allow businesses to collectively buy electricity, and he was so pleased 
about it.  "That's exactly what we talked about!," he said.

I'll be around the rest of the month, so if we can get together that would 
be excellent.

Let me know if you have any more need for some San Diegan eyes and ears. 
Have a great afternoon --

Dana

Poor Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq). Despite its best efforts, including 
Wednesday's 21% gain, it's still less than half the stock it used to be. 
Trading at about $63 a share, it's well off its split-adjusted high of 
$165.50, reached near the end of last year. Meanwhile, archrival Ariba (ARBA
:Nasdaq), at about $150 a share, has steadily been marching back toward its 
all-time high of $183.31. It has jumped 47% since reporting its earnings on 
July 12. 
But as Wednesday's move may indicate, it may be Commerce One's turn. People 
are beginning to pay attention to the strength of its partnership with 
Germany's SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR). An exchange that Commerce One is helping build 
for the big automakers is about to crank up. And perhaps more importantly, 
some observers are beginning to see some value in Commerce One's focus on 
so-called direct B2B, which involves buying and selling major supplies like 
steel for cars instead of office supplies. 
Issues Aplenty
Of course, there are still plenty of issues facing Commerce One, the same 
issues that have held its stock down. For instance, it carries the stigma of 
being a concept stock because no one knows whether those same big industry 
exchanges actually will work. Its sluggish stock also puts it at a 
disadvantage to chief competitor Ariba when it comes to making acquisitions 
to grow. 
But for now, there are signs that sentiment is shifting in Commerce One's 
favor. 
Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, sees three short-term positives 
for Commerce One. (He's the analyst who had the gall to downgrade Ariba on 
valuation concerns. His firm hasn't done underwriting for either company.) 
Mlinar says the word on Wall Street is that Commerce One, along with its new 
best friend SAP, will announce two new online exchanges in the coming weeks. 
(TSC's Adam Lashinsky recently wrote a column about the partnership between 
Commerce One and SAP.) While those sorts of announcements no longer guarantee 
a moon shot for a company's stock, they could show that the partnership is 
working. Two weeks ago, they announced new exchanges in the mining and energy 
industries. 
Commerce One declined to comment about the possible exchanges. 
Blastoff
On top of that, Covisint, the mega-exchange that Commerce One is helping 
build for the auto industry, is slated to begin operations at the end of 
September, which could give the first indication of whether these exchanges 
actually work. 
Then there's the coming completion of Commerce One's acquisition of 
consulting firm AppNet (APNT:Nasdaq). Investors initially reacted negatively 
to that deal. But since then, it's become clear that there aren't enough 
consultants in B2B to go around, so the deal will give Commerce One its own 
army of geeks to plug in its software. 
"There's no doubt that investors are in a good position with" either Commerce 
One or Ariba, Mlinar says. "But it's a matter now of who has the near-term 
operational catalysts. I think there, it's Commerce One." 
Beyond those short-term catalysts, others say Commerce One has been 
positioning itself smartly for the long term, especially with its focus on 
the direct business. 
"We think the big play here is in direct," says John Biestman, director of 
investor relations for Commerce One. "While we will continue to service the 
indirect procurement side, we are hitting at the heart of where we think B2B 
will be, which is direct goods. We want to be the best-of-breed player 
there." 
Ariba has also made headway there, but its focus has primarily been on the 
indirect business, in part because it's easier to get companies to buy things 
like paper and pencils online than material that actually goes into the 
manufacturing process. But with companies becoming more comfortable about 
buying and selling online, they're now looking to the direct business as a 
way to save more money. With big customers like GM (GM:NYSE) and Boeing (BA
:NYSE) and its partnership with SAP, Commerce One could be ready to exploit 
this growing comfort. 
Direct vs. Indirect
"What's happening is the marketplace is beginning to understand the 
difference between direct and indirect," says Ben Smith, a consultant for 
A.T. Kearney. (His firm hasn't done consulting for Commerce One.) "Picking a 
[software] solution for one doesn't necessarily include the other." 
Smith points back to Commerce One's partnership with SAP. For years, the 
German software maker has been concentrating on the complex kind of software 
that helps businesses build things. If a firm can successfully plug that in 
to software designed to buy the building blocks -- like Commerce One's 
software -- it could have a winning combination. 
"The SAP partnership legitimizes Commerce One in the direct materials space," 
Smith says. "It gives them much more depth from the product standpoint than 
they can possibly build on their own." 
Of course, Ariba isn't letting this business just slide by. It's working with 
partners i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq) and IBM(IBM:Nasdaq). 
But this is Commerce One's focus. So if companies do begin to use direct B2B, 
Commerce One will be ready and waiting.

I'm on top of this.  Thanks.

Has anyone talked with Tim B about what Larcamp said -- ie the soft cap only 
applies to PX and ISO bids and not to any bilateral contracts including 
bilateral fwd contracts?  
	Donna Fulton
	11/14/2000 09:33 AM
		
Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for 
issues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.   
Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey 
is not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward 
market.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing 
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24 
months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage 
of their needs from this contract.
A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market 
(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that 
generation not be cancelled in California.
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the 
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what 
is opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact, 
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater 
incentive to sell elsewhere.
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not 
eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be 
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues 
and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be 
only for one month).
Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission 
should not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was 
one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied 
to the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet 
the 5% test.
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's 
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their 
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation 
before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of 
today.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include 
stranded costs.
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be 
changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A 
Court battle was threatened.

	Steven J Kean
	11/13/2000 08:51 AM
		
There are a few other issues we need to look into:

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I 
suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
"exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it 
through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.  
Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we 
should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward.
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible).
Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, 
acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of 
issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our 
comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have 
already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply 
cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I 
haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.

Hey Jeff,
What a surprise -- yesterday I was looking at the latest "Berkeleyan" and 
on page three there you were!  Have you seen the picture?  It is from the 
electricity summit.  It is a picture of you and a guy that looks like Burl 
Ives -- It sort of looks like he is telling you an off color joke.  (It 
also says that you are director of enron corp.!)  Anyway, it was great 
treat to see you in the local rag.  Brightened my day.

This sounds like a very delicious recipe to make for Saturday - relatively 
easy too and uses our beautiful sage.  It was in my e-mail this morning.

Neapolitan Pork Roast with Potatoes 
6 - 8 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
2 Tbs (30 ml) chopped fresh sage leaves or 2 tsp (10 ml) dried sage 
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
1 boneless pork loin roast, 2 to 3 pounds (1 to 1.5 Kg) 
2 lbs (1 Kg) potatoes, cut into 1-inch (3 cm) cubes 
2 Tbs (30 ml) olive oil 
Combine the garlic, sage, salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Make holes 
in the pork roast with a small paring knife and stuff the garlic 
mixture in the holes with your finger, reserving about 1 teaspoon (5 
ml) of the garlic mixture.  Rub any remaining garlic mixture on the 
outside of the roast.  Toss the potatoes with the reserved garlic 
mixture and the olive oil.  Place the roast and the potatoes in a 
roasting pan and place in a preheated 425F (220C) oven.  Remove from 
the oven and stir the potatoes after 30 minutes.  Baste the roast with 
the pan juices and return to the oven.  Lower the heat to 325F (160C) 
and continue to cook, stirring the potatoes and basting the roast 
about every 15 minutes.  Begin checking the internal temperature of 
the roast after about 1 1/4 hours total cooking time.  Remove the 
roast when the internal temperature is 140F (65C) for meat that is 
still slightly pink.  Let the roast rest for 15 minutes before carving.  
Return the potatoes to the oven if they are not crisp and golden. Serves 6 to 
8.

I will go ahead and send a couple of copies off to you -- it doesn't seem 
like their website has the picture.  Yes, it is funny that we are back in 
Berkeley -- and so close to where we used to live.  We were very hesitant 
about moving back here, but I am very surprised by how much I like 
it.  Berkeley is a weird place and I continually see faces that I recognize 
from 20 years ago.  I am glad to be out of Noe Valley though -- that was a 
bit over the top.  At this point our house is an eyesore and a very cold 
one a that.  It is a great old place though -- built in 1906 and we are 
only the 2nd owners -- that is amazing.  I love the election!  and I really 
love Katherine "I am ready for my close-up" Harris.  She is such a 
freak.  As of today it seems like Bush is going to be able to grab it.  For 
God's sakes where is Al Haig when you need him?  He must be dead otherwise 
he would be in control!  OK Babe -- I am off -- I would love to see you and 
your gal -- maybe over the holiday season we can arrange to bump into each 
other -- a little irish coffee somewhere?
yours,

Thanks for hosting, Kim.  Jackie mentioned the list of tasks that remain to 
get this done (e.g., graphs, make spreadsheet pretty, write-up, etc.).  I'lll 
do whatever needs to be done, so once folks have picked which task they'd 
like to take on, just let me know what's left.  Or if there's another way 
folks would like to divvy up the chores, that's great, too.  Have a great 
weekend.  See you Monday.

Sure Sue has filled you in, but just to be certain, my understanding is that 
Dan Douglas, attorney for WPTF, is going to meet with the AG (not sure when) 
in an attempt to narrow the scope of the subpoena.  Dan also plans to begin 
drafting responses to the subpeona.  Since we are a member of WPTF and 
therefore presumably covered by the subpoena, seems important that our 
attorney's coordinate with Dan.  Sue, if I've mangled anything, let me know.

Attached is a summary of SCE's filing to End the Rate Freeze with analysis 
and some recent statistical data.  I am also forwarding SCE's filing.  In 
short SCE's proposal would:

End the Rate Freeze and implement rates on January 1, 2001, without due 
process;
Guarantee SCE 100% CTC recovery;
Provide SCE shareholders with additional windfalls;
Use stranded benefits to subsidize SCE's Standard Offer Service; and
Entrench SCE in the default service provider role and thwart future

Well PG&E may not have filed its rate stabilization plan, but SCE  did.
Here it is.

Attached is Southern California Edison Company's Rate Stabilization Plan
Application, A.00-11-038.  This application was filed with the California
Public Utilities Commission today and a copy has been sent, via US Mail, to
the service lists for A.00-01-009 (PTRD) and A.99-01-034 (PTR).

Thanks Jeff.  Yesterday we sold 50 MW for 5 years out of January '01 for 
$60.00 in the unconstrained zone (i.e SCE1)

Congratulations.  Even though it's the EEI agreement, getting Edison to agree 
to sign something is an achievement.  Good luck landing deals.

Rob:
Here's a quick and dirty list of some lessons from California that Alberta 
may not want to repeat.  Steve, let me know if I've missed any messages we're 
using to describe California's woes (or mangled any, for that matter.  If you 
have any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch. 

Best,
Jeff

Great presentation, but the message seems a little blurred.

OK.  It's done.  Got two places.  One sleeps 8 and is big and is where we can 
have the party.  The other sleeps 6 and is very close by.  Right on the 
beach, so surfing will be a must.  Who is on your list for invites so far?

Dave/Sandi:  FYI.  In Joseph's absence, his fill-in asked that I take a call 
yesterday from the Mayor's office.  They called to confirm the meeting set up 
for Dave, Mike Day and Bev Hanson on Nov. 29th at 4 PM to discuss the serious 
electricity shortage in SF.

Best,
Jeff

Chuckles is a must invite.

I just found the best burrito place in the 'Loin. I'm also psyched about 
that also.

Didn't you want to send this to Steffes?

I'm adding my two cents.  Here's 3, but not 4.  Few things.  

1) I considered that everything was "material."  That reasonable? 

2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided 
it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of 
inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra.  But a case for extra can still, 
be made I think.  

3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban, 
since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken 
in 1994, as opposed to a "potential litigation outcome" that they'd make an 
allowance for---I could be wrong, though.  

4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included 
in the 1995 "income from continuing operations" number, and consequently 
included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit 
line item in the income statement.  

I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and 
circulate.

Best,
Jeff

Questions

1.  Litigation - how should we account for the 1994 bill of 500,000 in 1994
- I assume this was not accounted for in the 1994 income statement - we
could include a note on pro forma numbers for the 1994 statement or we
could just include this cost in 1995 - I am including it in the 1995
recalculated income statement, but I don't think this is totally accurate.

Thoughts anyone?

2.  In the text, page 354, Other gains or losses from the sale or
abandonment of PP&E used in a business is not supposed to be reported under
extraordinary items.  This means the two sites Agro sold for $750,000
(after tax gain) should not be counted under extraordinary items.  In this
case - we could 1) assume this is accounted for already in the 9.5 million
number given to us or 2) add it in after "income from continuing
operations" and before "discontinued operations."  I went with option 2.

Let me know if you have any issues with this treatment.

3.  Are we supposed to do anything with the 30,411,380 of retained
earnings?  I did not include pay out of dividends in the income statement.

Cheers,

OK.  Having taken a second look at the spreadsheet I sent yesterday, here's a 
revised sheet (there was a math error in the original), and my adds to Kim's 
#4.  Most significant issue:  the discrepancy between Kim's and mine is that 
Kim's assumes that the $9,5 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain 
on sale, while mine assumes that it doesn't (i.e., Kim subtracts them, I add 
them).  No big deal, we just need to make an assumption and go with it.  
There's a couple of other differences that are identified in the answer to 
#4--again, just need to make the call either way.

Best,
Jeff

Rumor on the street that the legislature may make a last minute play to 
change the make-up of the governing boards (at least for the ISO) from the 
current stakeholder make-up to one made up of appointees of the governor.

My understanding is the same.  Content looks good.  Message points been 
developed in the event they're needed?

Will have any comments to you pronto.

See attached.  Just a couple of typos corrected in strike-out-underline.  
Question:  Thought I'd included the gain on sale as "unusual" as opposed to 
"extraordinary."  If we leave it out, are we assuming it's already included 
in the $9.5MM?  If so, we might want to include a note at the bottom of the 
spreadsheet like, $9.5 MM figure includes $750,000 gain on sale of certain 
assets completed in 1995."  Or am I just totally out lunch on this one. 

Thanks.  This one was a little messy.  You did a great job of pulling it 
together.

Dear Friends,

In case you missed it last week I am circulating a press release announcing
our new fixed rate pricing plan for the San Diego area.  8.5 cents per kWh,
no monthly fee, 100% renewable, price guaranteed for a year.

As we debate how to modify the California electric market, this type of
product structure may be a good model for small customer default service.
That is, perhaps small customers should get a fixed price, for a fixed
period, that is known in advance, as opposed to a floating price that
changes every month and that the customer only learns 30 days after they use
it.

I like it.  Give it one final read through for final refinements.  Then send 
to bay guardian, sf weekly, pacific sun (marin), (and the east bay has a 
weekly mag, too, the name of which escapes me--might be out of berkeley).  
Any of these would give good exposure, and likelihood of someone of your

I am leaving town Wed, not to return until Monday.  So I will work on the 
next case tonight (early questions) and send what I have to the team.

Hi, Marcie.  I've added two things to the end of the update:

PG&E/Edison sue the PUC in federal court to recover procurement costs.
Edison files proposal with PUC to declare rate freeze is over and establish a 
new rate freeze at 110% of old rate freeze that would last for 5 years.

I don't have all the details to fill in, though some of the details might be 
available from the PG&E/Edison websites, and Sue and Mona might have 
additional info.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

will do.

Might be useful to observe how others react prior to responding.  The good 
senator may have to fight over the surplus with a lot of teachers looking to 
spend the $$s on school books.  That fight could get interesting if the 
backdrop for the debate is a CEC report that sez "no problem, we're in 
charge."

I'm sure we'd be willing to build a few plants for $2 billion...

my pleasure.

No, you're correct.  In the spreadsheet, there were three sorts of "items":  
discontinued ops, unusual items, extraordinary items, and accounting 
changes.  The sale of the assets came about in the attempt to "trim the fat" 
(or manage earnings, you make the call).  Here's the line item from my 
spreadsheet:

It came right after the entries for the "unusual loss from the government 
ban."  I included it with the "unusual" items (right after discontinued ops 
and right before extraordinary items.  Big question is, is it included 
already.  I assumed not, since (though it's confusing), the problem makes is 
sound like none of the additional "agenda items" were accounted for.  I don't 
think it's a huge deal, though.  The questions left a lot of room for 
ambiguity.

Best,
Jeff

Maybe I am confused.  I thought that the sale of the assets was separate 
from the discontinued operations of the Feed division.  Unfortuneatly I do 
not have my book here to check.

"Soft Price Caps and Underscheduling Penalties: How Would the FERC Plan 
Affect California Electricity Markets?"  (November 2000)
   PWP-079 by Steven Stoft

FERC proposes three short-run stabilization "remedies" in its Market Order 
Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electrics, issued November 1, 
2000. The first allows the IOUs to purchase power outside the PX. The 
second sets a penalty that will frequently reach $100/MWh on unscheduled 
power in excess of 5% of a purchaser's total load. The third is a $150 
"soft" price cap on the ISO and PX. On the infrequent occasions when the 
cap is effective, it will exacerbate the scheduling problem. Generally, 
when needed, it will be subverted by exemptions for opportunity costs. 
Because the soft cap is applied to the PX, but not to other scheduling 
coordinators, it will drive suppliers away from the PX. Allowing more 
forward contracting of net suppliers will reduce market power, but it will 
be very expensive without an effective bid cap. To be effective, a bid cap 
must allow no exceptions and must also be a regional cap to avoid causing 
reliability problems for California.

Cameron doens't want you to send that Grinch thing out to anyone. Not that 
she would. She wants to edit it, and try to send it out all at once. 
Whatever. I'm forced to tell you.

If you would make an oyster stuffing - that would be really grand!  Not one 
for inside the bird - but a separate one - does that work?  I'm doing the 
cranberries tonight - but if yours is different from normal (!) we can 
always have another! 

     -----Original Message-----

These performance reviews may push me right over the edge.

Good talking to you earlier.  Sounded like the Paul I know and admire.  You 
sounded energized.  Looking forward to having you around more.  

One thing.  Please don't count December out as a possible start time for the 
special session.  Anything can happen.  Book your hotel room early.

Best,
Jeff

the damned book costs $100!  i've borrowed yours.  you know where to find it.

There's a place for working and re-working.  There's also a a very important 
place in art--writing in particular--for spontaneity and whim.  I'd do a 
tweak here and a snip there, but quickly and only around the edges, and 
submit it as a film review.  It's novel, it's fun, and exposure'd a good 
thing.

Things are good.  Going to be weary for the next 3-4 weeks until schools out, 
though.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks for your suggestions. It's good to know, not only for this, but for 
the future as well. I don't know what the hell Cameron wants to do. She 
thinks that she is some kind of expert editor, when really she is a goddamn 
lawyer who has read a book or two! She does want it to be the best it can 
be, but it is ultimately not that important! Oh well. I'm just going to go 
ahead and do what I want with it anyway.

Hope all's well.

Rick:

Just want to let you know that I missed the boat a bit in coordinating my 
reviewers with Paul.  In my first attempt to input them in the system, I 
hesitated including you for the simple reason that I'm certain you have 
countless other reviews to do already, and, frankly, I feel that you're an 
integral part of my review whether you're formally on the list or not.  When 
I went back to make my final additions to the list, the systerm was already 
closed--Paul had approved the first round, which I guess shuts it down.  

It's likely not appropriate for reviews to happen outside the system, but I 
wanted to let you know that, from my perspective, it would be great to 
receive from you.  I'd value it a lot.  And I think we've worked closely 
enough together over the last year for you to have a basis for reviewing me.  
But again, I'm of the view that irrespective of the list, you partake in my 
review of necessity, and I don't want to add any additional burdens to an 
already loaded schedule.

No big deal, just wanted to let you know.

And I'm having a field day filling out your review. ("Rick discriminates 
unfairly against neon-colored shirts.")   Seriously, I was quite pleasantly 
surprised to have ended up as one of your reviewers.

Best,
Jeff

It's a never-ending cavalcade....

Here's the report that Sue referenced earlier.  Appears that the 
administration's analysis of California's energy problems will continue to 
focus solely on the "bad actor" conspiracy theory.

The Press Release:
California Energy Commission Report Released

                        Summer of 2001 Electricity Supplies Better Than
Expected

     Sacramento -- California should have enough power to meet its
electricity demand next summer, unless the State experiences extraordinarily
hot
     Weather, according to a study released today by the Energy Commission.

     "With new resources coming on-line and new conservation measures taking
effect, next summer looks better than expected, if we manage our
     resources properly," said Steve Larson, Energy Commission Executive
Director.

     The study, prepared as part of a response to legislation enacted in
September, quantified the amount of electricity demand and supply expected
in the
     summer of 2001. "We produced this analysis from the ground up,"
commented Larson. "We looked at every power plant and source of electricity
     available to the State to give us a realistic appraisal of where we
stand for next summer. Energy Commission staff projected expected peak
electricity
     demand using three temperature scenarios."

     The analysis indicated that under the "most likely" temperature
conditions, next year's electricity peak demand will be 47,266 megawatts,
which reflects
     a reduction of 220 megawatts of demand because of new utility and state
energy conservation initiatives. Operating reserve requirements add an
     additional 2,200 to 3,000 megawatts demand in order to provide a 7
percent margin, raising the generation needed to a minimum of 50,303
     megawatts.

     If California experiences a warmer than normal summer, the electricity
system will require 48,845 megawatts plus operating reserve requirements,
     which raises the total to 51,882 megawatts. Under this scenario, total
expected resources are 52,550 megawatts. Should the State experience
     extremely hot temperatures, which has a 1-in-10 year likelihood of
occurring, 53,104 megawatts will be needed (50,068 megawatts of demand plus
     operating reserve requirements), with expected resources of 52,190
megawatts.

     An additional 1,888 - 3,087 megawatts of potential generation is
currently under development and may be available for part or all of the
summer.

     The Energy Commission's demand forecast takes into consideration
expected economic conditions and household growth in the State. These two
     factors influence demand for air conditioning which drives summer peak
demand for electricity. The Energy Commission's staff supply outlook
includes
     existing in-state and out-of-state generation; new power plants
expected to be on-line and generating electricity by August 1, 2000; and
electricity
     imports and exports. The supply outlook also includes new renewable
energy projects and energy efficiency measures and initiatives made possible
by
     funding under AB 970, which was approved by the Governor in September,
2000.

     California's electricity demand is growing at 2 percent per year. To
ensure that there are adequate supplies of electricity to meet future
demand, it will
     be important to add new, efficient generation as well as to implement
energy efficiency and demand reduction strategies.

     Since restructuring occurred in March 1998, the Energy Commission has
approved six major power plant projects with a combined generation
     capacity of 4,708 megawatts. In addition another 15 electricity
generating projects totaling over 7,000 megawatts and an estimated capital
investment
     of more than $4 billion are being considered for licensing by the
Commission.

     The report, Summer of 2001 Forecasted Electricity Demand and Supplies,
is available on the Energy Commission's Web Site at:

some possible options, including the state taking over the transmission

the output of the states power plants, or having the state build power
plants.  Again, he is not proposing these, they are just options for the
Governor.

Other comments of interest:

- Generators are only willing to build power plants if they can get 14 cent=

Hello Everyone,

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Sue

Here's what I need (thanks, honey):

3 bags of fresh cranberries
2 oranges
box of brown sugar
6 jars of oysters
6 loaves of bread (get the "rounds" of bread---vary them, like olive bread, 
sour dough, sweet, whole grain, potato)
thing of celery
4 large yellow onions
couple bulbs of garlic
2 pounds of butter (clover, salted)

Thanks, sweetie, and good luck on your midterm!

Forgive the tardiness.  As soon as I come up from air from completing a tidal 
wave of performance reviews, I'll give a full report.  Bottom line:  His 
message is a very good one.  His delivery could use a tad spicing up, 
however.  Unfortunately, when I was free, he was in meetings, and vice 
versa.  So we never got to sit down and chat.  I'll fill you in more soon.

Byron,

Attached are the comments of the WPTF regarding the ISO's congestion
management reform proposal.  We endorse the proposal developed by the
California PX on this matter, and in our response so note from time to
time a reference to their document.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide our input.  The format for
response was well thought out, and although it took some effort to
compete the form, it will provide an invaluable guide to compare
responses made by different parties.

B2Bs Rose Hard and Fell Hard Once Before. Time for Act Two?
By Joe Bousquin 
Staff Reporter
8/30/00 9:22 PM ET 
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1060952.html

Beware the booming B2Bs. 
Several business-to-business stocks rocketed upward Wednesday on little news 
as the Nasdaq waffled for most of the day. While some market watchers said 
investors were betting on a strong quarter, many analysts couldn't explain 
increases of 15% or more in stocks like Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), Ventro 
(VNTR:Nasdaq), PurchasePro.com (PPRO:Nasdaq) and Clarus (CLRS:Nasdaq). 

Big Day for B2B
Several of the stocks rallied Wednesday on little news.

"You've got me," says Bill Epifanio, B2B analyst at J.P. Morgan. "They're all 
going nuts on nothing." 
Since earnings season ended, sentiment about B2B stocks has shifted back to 
the rose-colored variety in this sector. While this change is based on the 
concrete results that companies like Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq), i2 Technologies 
(ITWO:Nasdaq) and FreeMarkets (FMKT:Nasdaq) delivered, investors also may 
want to pause and reflect. After all, it was only this past spring that 
investors grabbed any B2B stock within reach on hopes of unlimited growth, 
only to have them come crashing back down. 
Focus
"Before, we were buying stocks on promises of what they could be, and that's 
when it got out of hand," says Eric Upin, B2B analyst at Robertson Stephens. 
"Now, you've got to focus on which stocks are delivering lots of growth and 
revenue." 
Upin looks to Ariba and i2 Technologies as examples of companies that are 
actually delivering. (He rates both a buy, and his firm hasn't done 
underwriting for either.) 
Ariba recorded $153 million in deferred revenue in the most recent quarter. 
Deferred revenue is money that a company collects before it actually delivers 
a product or does its job. It's a good signal, because if people are willing 
to pay before a company gives them something in return, it means there's 
strong demand. Ariba was up $8, or 6%, to $152.50. 
i2 is considered a strong player in supply-chain management software, and it 
has a partnership with Ariba and IBM (IBM:NYSE). It climbed $11.13, or 7%, to 
$168.75. 
Reaching?
But in a possible indication that investors may have just been reaching for 
any B2B stock, Ventro finished up $2.69, or 21%, at $15.50 on no news. This 
is the same company that upset analysts and investors with a poor 
second-quarter performance, with just $1.8 million in net revenue. "Investors 
need to be more careful regarding which of the B2Bs they select," adds David 
Hilal, a B2B analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey. "When B2B was at its 
highest, any company that used that acronym seemed to perform well. Now, you 
have to dig deeper and figure out which ones are the real players in this new 
economy." 
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting subplots Wednesday involved Commerce 
One. On no real news -- there was talk about an already announced deal -- 
Commerce One shot up $10.88, or 21%, to $63.25. 
There's been a lot of chatter about the company lately. Gossips love to talk 
about how its partnership with German software maker SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR) might 
lead to a merger. Then there's the persistent rumor that the two companies 
will soon announce two more Internet exchanges for major industry groups. On 
top of that, Covisint, the big auto exchange that Commerce One is helping 
build, is setting up to launch near the end of September. 
Lump that in with the fact that Commerce One's stock has slouched in Ariba's 
shadow lately, add a dash of Wednesday's positive sector sentiment, and 
you've got the most active stock on the Nasdaq Wednesday. It traded more than 
27 million shares, whereas it usually trades 6.6 million. 
Ready to Bolt
Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, says the stock has been setting 
up for a move for a while. 
"September is a big month for them; they have so much on the table for a 
potential lift," Mlinar says. He's been crowing about Commerce One since 
mid-August, when he said the company was starting to look more attractive 
than Ariba on a valuation basis. 
And overall, Mlinar contends that conditions were right for a B2B run. 
"The emphasis and momentum has clearly been building lately," he says. "There 
wasn't much, on a broad basis, since April, and now we're seeing a total 
rotation into these names." 
Which is just what some observers are cautioning against.

Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

Mark,

Here's my shot.  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes.  Note 
that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 
1,000 MW of retail load -- we're bigger than all but two of the municipal 
utilities in the state.  Enron stopped marketing to residential consumers -- 
that's what all the  fuss was about in 1997.  Anyone else feel free to take 
your own shot.

It's worth noting too (perhaps as part of Jeff's first or second points) that 
in addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, 
and the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine 
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their 
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in 
jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other 
than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and 
Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have 
ordered.

Alberta?

I'm not sure which is worse, the story, or the timing.  You psyched about the 
FERC approval?  And is there a story behind the sale of Sierra's power

Now wait one darn minute, lil' lady (do you hear John Wayne's voice?).  The 
price cap in California remains--that's right, remains--at a lofty $250/Mwh.

Agree that we should decline to participate.  I also got a call from IEP 
regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly 
diversify the group to include customers, consumer groups, and the like.

Haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff.  
Interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day 
that the report is released.  For the same reasons that we wouldn't want to 
be grouped with generators at a press conference, we may not want to be 
grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of

Two things:

1. I called Smutney last week re this press conference and declined.  I said 
that the idea is fine and we support it, but Enron does not want to 
participate in a press conference with other generators on this topic.

2. I just talked to Rob Lamkin of Southern who indicated that ten companies 
have gotten letters from Gov Davis addressed to "Dear CEO of Energy 
Company."  Letter was to invite these companies to attend a meeting on 
Monday, December 1 in LA.  Agenda and issues to follow, but Rob thought it 
had to do with the Gov's plan for CA due 12/1.  Meeting will not be with 
Davis, but with his staff.  Southern is deciding who to send.  Reliant will 
send John Stout and Curtis Keebler.  Williams got a letter, but no info re 
their rep.  Rob was calling to see if we got a letter and, if we did, out 
thoughts re meeting before the Gov's meeting to discuss.  I said we could

Greetings:

IEP will be holding a press conference on Tuesday November 28 at 10:30 a.m.
in the Governors Press room to discuss the importance of long-term fixed
(that term is easier to understand than bilateral) contracts.

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the
solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have
continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current
retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant
to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We
will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that
long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act
immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness
review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term
fixed contracts.

IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the
Press Conference.

We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show
that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term
fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if
you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as
we are sending out an advisory on Monday.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the 
auspices of IEP.  We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length 
relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.  If 
we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely 
aligned/associated with them we want to be.  Further we distance ourselves, 
less likely we'll be cut in.  

That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable) 
conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.  There 
was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of 
"price cap" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion 
whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.  There were differences of opinion 
about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----Williams is dead set against 
it, Dynegy & Reliant seemed considerably more pliable.  

We reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that 
California could do to "fix" the problem (e.g., site plants, forward 
contracts, retail market, core/noncore split, etc.), which might obviate the 
need for caps altogether.  We also recognized the political nature of the 
situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be 
acceptable, but pointed out our general concerns with caps.

That last meeting provided the impetus for the 28th press conference, at 
which (hopefully) a large number of stakeholders with urge the Governor and 
the PUC to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop 
a rational policy for forward contracting by the IOUs and abandon the "PUC as 
counterparty" policy that currently exists.

Again, haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds.  Will check around, 
though.

Best,
Jeff

FYI
IEP's public affairs consultant arranged an editorial board meeting for me 
while I was in town for the NARUC meeting.  Present were Don Sevrens, news 
editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, 
editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the 
reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer.

My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is 
working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in 
California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply 
shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and 
expediting the permitting process.  I was subtly trying to get across the 
message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to 
reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their 
power supply and demand into balance.  I, of course, defended FERC's order on 
the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack 
of any authority to order retroactive refunds.  I also pointed out that there 
were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be 
warranted even if there was legal authority.  I also pointed out the problems 
with price caps.

Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others 
asked good questions and seemed to be listening.  They made the point 
repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political 
compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary.  One of them said he 
had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me 
my position.  I responded that I had no response.  Anything like that is the 
business of individual members.

They indicated that they expected to do a story for this coming Sunday's 
Insight Section.  Please give me any feedback you have.

I'll check with Smutney.  Can you two check with your Dynegy and Reliant 
contacts in Houston?

Does

Lee planned to call them agree to do it.  And in that scenario it seems to 
make
sense to hold our next call til they can participate so we can nail down a

and time and initial speaker list with them.  We can't set a date til we know

What's the latest tally in Florida?  It gets increasingly important every

Unless Loretta Lynch, or worse, Gray Davis are your counter parties.

Here are IEP's comments on caps.  It's from a draft circulated last Friday,=
=20
but just spoke with Smutney, and he said that the comments did not change=
=20
substantively .  Very briefly, "IEP is generally opposed to caps, but if=20

with other reforms (i.e., forward contracting, siting, retail markets,=20
etc.)."  The comments do not explicitly address the level of the cap.  They=
=20
also call for a technical conference.

Anything to add, Sue?
IEP has concerns about the implementation of the =01&soft cap=018 proposal.=
  IEP=20

there are demands which materialize only for a fraction of a percentage of=

Hey:
Just wanted to let you know that I've received all the SDG&E stuff and that 
you can count on me to completely drop the ball.

Kidding!  I'll take care of it.  I'm still awash in reviews and may not ever 
leave the building, which is why I'm not responding as promptly as I should.

Jim:

business with you.

Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.  The 
very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both 
settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved 
under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that 
paid off.

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point 
out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, 
when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it 
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of 
making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, 
whatever turns up at the end.

Best,
Jeff

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Thanks, all.  I'll get a compiled answer out later today.

I'll take a look at it.  If I have any comments, I'll forward them along.  
Also, I may forward along some very slight changes to the numbers on the 
ISO's RFP "experience," should you decide you want to incorporate those 
"lessons" into your presentation. I'll provide any amendments to those 
numbers by tomorrow.

OK folks, here it is.  Sorry for the delay, but those pesky questions ended 
up being more detailed than I anticipated.  Please take a quick look and let 
me know if there are any comments---more ambiguities than usual in this one.  
I'll await comments and finalize this evening.  

Jimmie/Dylan--my apologies, but last Wednesday evening, I found out that I 
have to be in LA for a meeting tomorrow.  If I make it to class at all 
tomorrow, I won't get there until after the break.  Could one of you print 
out the case and bring it to class?  If not, don' t sweat it, I'll email him 
an electronic and turn in a hard copy to him on Tuesday. Sorry for any hassle.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks.  I'll soften the expropriation language.  I don't think they can 
disclose the $1 million on the product liability case, since the entire 
package appears to be one  negotation, all the pieces of which likely have to 
be agreed to, or no settlement.  But you're point's well taken and I'll try 
to acount for it in the answer.  Finally, I can't see disclosing the fact 
that I'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report.  Seems like I'd 
have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me, if I'd admitted 
it to it in my annual report.

If I don't see you tomorrow, have a good week.

Jeff,

Sorry, I didn't realize we were attacking this one early over the holiday, 
and I was out of town
until this afternoon. My conclusions differed from the attached write up on a 
few points, but I am
not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes:

On the expropriation:

In the write up we say "We agree with the executive that Global should report 
the expropriation
contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 were 
met:  1) sufficient
information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be 
reasonably estimated.
Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major 
industries.  "

The book says "The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a public 
or private
declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterprise 
or actual
expropriation of assets of other enterpises." I would argue that Matuto was 
not the government and
therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office. 
It also says FASB 5
requires the two accrual criteria to be met.

As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and 
nationalization of resources
was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 1995 
that the government
intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the 
telephone company took
place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think 
they should not accrue
in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the 
asset was fully functional
and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they 
should disclose that the
possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not 
accrue..

I disagree that the company should cease use of the patent infringing 
technology, I believe that
companies frequently make conscious business decisions to infringe upon 
patents. Since I agree that
an accrual is not in order, perhaps a general disclosure regarding patent 
litigation should be
made.

The book states that "If there are several aspects of litigation, each of 
which gives rise to a
possible claim, then the accrual criteria should be applied to each possible 
claim...."

Thus I think we should break up the product liability suit into pieces. 
They've agreed to pay 1M
for lost rentals. This should clearly be accrued, assuming it hasn't been 
paid yet. The tenants
claims are expected to be settled for 1M, this too should be accrued. The 
surrounding property
claims are not estimable, and therefore should be handled with a disclosure.

Greetings Professor:

I'm in charge of managing our collective responses to this week's case and 
have been called out of town on business at the last minute.   As a result, 
if I make it to class at all tomorrow, I unfortunately won't make it until 
after the break.  While I think one of my teammates will bring a hard copy to 
class tomorrow, I wanted to plan for any mix-ups (contingencies?) by emailing 
a copy as well.

Best,
Jeff

Folks:

Here's the final.   I incorporated some comments from Christine and emailed a 
copy to Aceves.  Jimmie/Dylan let me know if one of you can bring a hard copy 
to class tomorrow.  If not, he's now got an electronic copy, and I'll drop 
off a hard copy on Tuesday.  Hope to see you (for at least half the class) 
tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff

You're the man.  I got some comments from Christine (sort of).  See most 
recent email.  I emailed it to Aceves, but if more changes come in, I don't 
see any problem telling him to disregard the email and use the hard copy you 
turn in tomorrow.  Thanks a million.  Greatly appreciated.  I owe you one.  
This one was really a hot potato.  First Kim, then me, now you.  

Best,
Jeff

F.Y.I.

                              
  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4 
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it 
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

p.s. the plant i was talking about is:  "hairy vetch"  or "purple vetch."  
i'll look for some.  you should, too.  if you find any, make sure it's 
"organic" and hasn't had any chemicals added to the seeds.

thanks again for a fantastic time over Thanksgiving.  I had a lot of fun.

That's great Riddles will be there.  Bobby said he would try to be there
late Friday night (after Davis), but that was it.  

WE ARE GETTING HER THE BANJO SHE HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF (Earl Scruggs Gibson
banjo with maple neck).  DO NOT GET ANYTHING ELSE EITHER OF YOU THE BANJO IS
VERY EXPENSIVE (around 2K) AND IT WILL BE FROM ALL OF US AND IT WILL BE BOTH
HER BIRTHDAY AND XMAS.  Mom already said she will put in $500.  How about
the rest of you??  Can we make this happen.  I have all the details of the
banjo from Avram and Larry now and I am pricing it.  They have told me where
to get the best prices and Avram has put me in touch with a guy that just
bought one and researched prices for weeks.  I will update you when I have a
little more info.  OK???????????????????

Then we got Bobby most likely coming late on Sat night, after his gig in

Jeff--what can I help with?? What about her present... are we all getting 
her a banjo, or do you have something else you want to get her, leaving us 
to fend for ourselves?

Chapeau!

Folks.  Let me throw out a proposal.  I believe that we should immediately 
draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the PD is 
misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state, and why our 
settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state.  
The letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement.  It needs 
to be released by the end of this week.  Absent this kind of action, 
nothing's going to turn this thing around.  Spending time and money writing 
"comments" will be a waste of time and money.  We'll need to do a lot more, 
but I think we have to start this way or fold up our tents now.  Thoughts?

I haven't had the opportunity to read the PD yet, but I share your
frustration with the Commission's inaction in the face of significant and
fast moving events.  Our settlement and electric restructuring are clearly
distinguishable.  Arguably, the status quo has, in part, perpetuated the
record high prices being observed of late.  The Commission should have
little to fear by proceeding with its initial direction of statewide
consistency in the intrastate gas industry.

If I'm reading pages 38 - 40 of the Bilas PD correctly, the Commission's
primary concern over the competitive benefits of city-gate pricing is the
fact that PG&E city-gate prices in October were much higher than border
prices plus transportation.  October bidweek PG&E city-gate prices were
high, but only because southern California prices plummeted from the high
levels that they had reached in late August and September, following the El
Paso explosion.  In November, the PG&E city-gate moved back into its normal
relationship with Topock and Malin prices.  For the Commission to be
spooked
by one month of price fluctuations is crazy.

I'm hopeful that my friends at Edison, in particular, can help the
Commission to distinguish what we were trying to achieve in the CS on the
gas side from the mess that is electric restructuring....

Greetings Linda:

Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that 
California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.  

Just wanted to pass along some info.  I'm sure you've seen Senator 
Feinstein's comments to FERC.  And I think you're aware that she held a 
meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on 
the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.  She stated 
at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to 
place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.  Economists in the room 
expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly 
focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.  Not sure where it 
will go, but wanted to pass it along.

Best,
Jeff

I'm not buying and goddam banjo.  I can't stand the noise those freakin'

If there is going to be a play come the first of the year to meld 
California's PX and ISO, Skilling may want to consider pre-empting that 
agenda (and most of this is not new; already included in previous messaging 
points we've developed internally):

It's the gas industry, stupid---for profit transcos is the answer.
California's big mistake was replacing one monopoly--the utility---with 
another--the PX.  PX's are not necessarily bad things.  But PXs with a 
monopoly is a very bad thing.
Forcing the IOUS to buy everything from the PX was irresponsible.
"Put everyone on a variable rate mortgage" story.
Decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed 
NOT to encourage retail choice and competition.
Decision makers actively urged families and businesses NOT to switch to 
providers offering an "insurance policy" (i.e., fixed price deals) against 
the volatile and risky power exchange price.
When you combine the supply shortage, the PX monopoly, the nonexistant retail 
market and decision makers' attempts to discourage choice, you get a 
debacle--that's what California set itself up for, and that's what it got.
Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been 
inflicted.
The real answer is....(we've developed these points already).

This is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate, but 
wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints.

Best,
Jeff

not sure, but i assume that the bluegrass songbook is mine.  is it for 
guitar?

I'll need to ponder.  I'll try to get back to you pronto.

FYI.  We have this report?

Hi David:  Thought that you might be interested.

Best,
Jeff

Well, he launched today.  Have you seen the materials from the press 
conference that he launched today?  I think this is actually a good 
thing--makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by 
comparison, makes our support in the process more important, and sets Harvey 
up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California's broken 
system---a potential spoiler.

Hi.  Well, wouldn't you know it.  I'm not driving tonite, but I bet that we 
could hitch a ride back with Anil.  I'm not sure, but I think that he's got 
class tonite, too.  I'll search him out before class or after that break and 
see if I can set it up.

     Jeff - Hope you had a good turkey day.  I'm going to attend finance 
     tonight (instead of last night).  I was wondering if you know if 
     anyone from the SF crew is driving over and back tonight.  I am happy 
     to take BART over, but coming back is always a pain - as you know. 
     Thanks,
     Carolyn

Oh come on.  I heard that you're a ghost writer for Harvey's proposal!  

Kidding.  

Seriously, it's been great discussing these issues on panels with you 
lately.  I have a picture of the two of us from the Berkeley conference I'll 
pass along to you.  

I really think there's a way out of all this without dropping a nuclear bomb 
on all of the hard work folks have done thus far to restructure the 
industry.  Look forward to working on it.

Best,
Jeff

P.S. Don't have TOO much fun dangling the initiative in front of the likes of 
Peace and the IOUs.

FYI--  Despite strong urging, TURN did NOT join in the press conference or 
the initiative proposal referenced in this message.  Obviously we may have 
no choice but to do so in the future, depending upon how FERC, the 
Governor, the Legislature and the CPUC react to the unfolding crisis.  For 
now, we will continue to work for reasonable regulatory and legislative 
solutions that protect small ratepayers from the consequences of a debacle 
that they never asked for or wanted.   I am plannning to attend Friday's 
meeting of the group (unless I am disinvited) so that we can discuss 
constructive ways of making that happen.   MIKE

Hi Aleck:  How did your talk go?  I hope well.  If you're refering to the PX 
study on whether to have an "as-bid" or "single-price" auction, the PX is in 
the preliminary stages of having a report prepared.  What they've done is 
assemble a "Blue Ribbon" panel of economists (as reported in the press 
accounts you've seen) to examine the issue and report back.  I'm not aware of 
a report having yet been completed by the panel and submitted to the PX.  
Have you heard differently?  I'll poke around.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks, Delaney.  See you on Friday.  

Quick comment:  Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks 
seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon as 
they arrive in Sacramento (next week?).  Seems that a key--if not 
dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come to 
agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the Legislature 
and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.  Sure you folks are 
very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks pretty ambitious 
for a 3-hour meeting.  In any case, just a thought that I wanted to share.  

Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.

Best,
Jeff

  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4 
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it 
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

Dan Walters: A power crisis imperils Davis
(Published Nov. 26, 2000) 
Gov. Gray Davis would appear to be living a charmed political life. 
California's economy is soaring, the state's tax coffers -- and Davis' own 
re-election treasury -- are bulging, voters are in a complacent mood, and 
there have been none of the devastating disasters that plagued the state 
during the early 1990s. 
There is, however, a very dark cloud casting a shadow over Davis' 
governorship: the prospect of rolling blackouts as demand for electric power 
exceeds supply, accompanied by tremendous increases in Californians' power 
bills. And how Davis handles this incipient crisis could be the hallmark of 
his first term -- and, potentially, a re-election issue in 2002. 
San Diego utility customers were hit hard last summer as their local utility 
emerged from the mandatory rate freeze imposed by the state's 1996 utility 
deregulation scheme. Davis and the Legislature responded, in effect, by 
buying some time. They enacted legislation rolling back power bills 
temporarily, but leaving it unclear whether ratepayers, taxpayers, San Diego 
Gas and Electric Co. or power suppliers would eventually eat the wholesale 
costs that led to the spikes. 
Clearly, Davis was hoping that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC) would step in and force the suppliers to refund hundreds of millions 
of dollars to SDG&E and its ratepayers. And that, Davis and other politicians 
hoped, would also forestall a similar, but much larger crisis looming for 
customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the 
state's two largest private utilities. The two are still operating under the 
rate freeze, but have acquired at least $5 billion in unanticipated wholesale 
power costs that they want to pass on to their ratepayers. 
Politically, FERC intervention would be the most palatable of the 
alternatives because it would place the financial onus on mostly out-of-state 
corporations that have little political standing. California politicians have 
been demonizing the power suppliers, saying they took advantage of the 
deregulation program's auction process to drive up costs far beyond reason. 
The problem for Davis and others is that FERC is not cooperating, pointedly 
refusing to intervene in a way that the governor wanted. Davis ripped into 
the FERC response during a hearing earlier this month, accusing it of 
"gutting (California's) ability to protect consumers" and proposing "new and 
completely untried market rules, making guinea pigs of California consumers 
in yet another reckless deregulation experiment." 
Davis wants to appoint himself as the California utility customer's best 
friend, hinting that he may lead a "ratepayer revolt" if FERC continues to 
refuse to order refunds from suppliers and new price controls. But it's 
unclear what he can do concretely, since he's on record as approving the 
overall thrust of deregulation and since many of the business interests he 
has cultivated to obtain his re-election funds have benefited from having 
power suppliers compete for their business. 
Doing nothing could mean that when Southern California Edison and PG&E emerge 
from the rate freeze, they will raise rates dramatically, just as Davis is 
seeking re-election in 2002. 
The utilities seem to be offering Davis a deal: allow them to begin raising 
rates now to recover their "stranded costs" for wholesale power and they will 
avoid sticker-shock raises in 2002. 
Another option would be for Davis to spend some of the state's billions of 
surplus dollars to either ease the impact on ratepayers or put the state into 
the power supply business itself. 
The only certainty is that unless FERC reverses itself, Davis will remain on 
the hook for whatever happens -- the sort of unpredictable situation that he 
hates to encounter.

Hmmmm, I think you're right.  Looks like the more we can get done tonite, the 
better.  Perhaps, if we can wrap the analysis up this evening, we can do some 
serious divvying up of assigments at the end of the meeting.  Then folks can 
go off and complete the assignments between now and Sunday, which should make 
Sunday's activities pretty light.  That make any sense?

Hmmm, looks like we may need to meet after the review session on Sunday...

What do you think?

Hello,
There will be a review session for the final exam. The session will be on 
11/2/00, from 10am onwards. The session will be in C135
As before, the goal will be for you to ask questions, and for us to come up 
with answers. I will not have a lecture planned in advance.

Mr. Dasovich,

Hello, my name is Adam, and I work as an administrative assistant to 
Ms. Susan Landwehr in Enron's Minneapolis satellite office.  She has 
asked me to compile an address list of several of her colleagues, 
including yourself.

Unfortunately, I have been unable to find your street address or that 
of your coworker, Mona Petrochko.  If you could email this 
information back to me, it would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Adam Kristensen
ENRON Corp.

what's your guys' view on this?

I will send out a real legislative report next week.  In the meantime, I
thought you might appreciate a quick run-down of what actually happened in
the final hours of this year's wild legislative session.

The good news is that the public benefit charge bill passed easily with a
10-year term and no statutory harm was done.  The bad news is that utilities
captured the deregulation debate and successfully painted generators as
villains and the wholesale market as "broken."

Major legislative actions on energy matters follow.  If you have any
questions or would like a copy of final legislation, please call.

AB 995 (Wright) and SB 1194 (Sher), which extend public benefit charges for
energy conservation, renewable energy development, and RD&D, passed the
State Legislature by large margins.  Recent indications are that the
Governor will sign the bills, although interested companies should join IEP
in sending letters urging him to do so.

Power plant siting was front and center the last week of the session.  As
recently as Wednesday of this week, the bill was so bad for new power plant
development that IEP opposed the expedited siting provisions.  They were
rewritten by Republican staff and CEC attorneys to provide a 6-month process
for a mitigated negative declaration of environmental impacts that might
help those few entities that can start the process in full compliance with
local rules.  This provision is available for both combined cycle facilities
and peaking facilities.  The bill also includes a provision for four-month
approval of amendments to pending applications providing for the
installation of temporary peaking generation  on sites that will be
developed into combined cycle facilities within three years.  The CEC
expects this to apply so a single pending application.  Finally, the bill
includes language directing the CPUC and the EOB to be helpful on ISO issues
that affect the willingness self-generators to remain interconnected with
the grid.

Utility efforts to craft legislation assuring them of collection of large
negative balances in their Transition Revenue Accounts failed when they
could not reach agreement with representatives of large customer groups.  In
its place, the Legislature passed a non-binding resolution directing the
CPUC to investigate the issue and including highly offensive language on
$100 price caps and retroactive recalculation of market clearing prices.
Legislation establishing a retroactive cap on SDG&E rates and providing no
assurance of cost recovery to Sempra passed the Legislature.  Companion
legislation that most observers expect the Governor to veto provides $150
million of General Fund money to SDG&E.

A draft of so-called "sunshine" legislation surfaced late in the process.
The draft empowered the Electricity Oversight Board to collect anything it
might be interested in from the ISO, PX, utilities, generators, and
marketers and to treat the information confidentially.  The draft faced
unified opposition and did not make its way into any legislation.

AB 1002 (Wright) establishing public benefit charges on the natural gas
system passed the Legislature.  It continues to include language exempting
electricity generation from the charges.

DWR now has authorization to buy down load at market prices.   

 Press Release 
   
OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR 
PR01: 285
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/10/2001 

GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE 

Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans 

LOS ANGELES 

Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes 
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary, 
emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large 
businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power 
emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating 
customers. 

"Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor 
Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even 
avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources 
to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they 
voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."

The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent 
load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent 
System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned 
Utilities. 

The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer 
2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be 
determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the 
amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated 
to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of 
customers who sign up.

likely exit fee scenarios. Could we talk today?

Thanks,

Kevin,
You may want to connect with Jeff Dasovich re: his belief on the three most 
likely alternatives for the exit fee issue and the probabilities of each.  
Mike Day, Dasovich will have the most current info.  
Lets see if we can't get this info quickly.  
Thanks
Marty - the latest -

2 Direct Access bills (Bowen, Kelly) are still on the table.  Have not 
changed much since my earlier e-mail to you, except that Bowen bill now 
includes a fee to the alternate provider when a customer is "involuntarily 
returned" to the utility.  Language is attached.

 - SB 27xx - mockup.doc

Right now, this legislation is awaiting the outcome of negotiations involving 
SCE and other parties (Jeff Dasovich is our rep).  Speaker Hertzberg and 
Senator Burton both have endorsed these negotiations and promised to support 
agreements the parties reach.   Jeff tells me this morning they are getting 
close to agreement on core/non-core and direct access issues but there are 
still major stumbling blocks,  mostly surrounding the going forward DWR costs 
and contracts, and the issuance of bonds to pay for them.  The bond guys see 
direct access as possible undermining the bonds.  If or once agreement is 
reached, the expectation is that enabling legislation would be crafted that 
would apply California-wide.

The general structure in the SCE discussion is this -
By Jan 1, '03, 500 kW+ customers decide to go to market or stay with utility 
for a long (5 yrs+) period.  Re-entry from market would be with up to 12 
month notice and could require customer to pay spot market price under 
utility default.   20-500 kw customers would have voluntary direct access.  
Under 20 kw customers would have green-only voluntary direct access.   
Recovery for past undercollections is being negotiated, but will likely 
require large customers (20 kw+)  to pay a disproportionate share of the 
costs.

This may be less than definitive, but as usual, the situation is fluid.   
Marty and Jeremy, are you available for a Wednesday morning call with Jeff 
Dasovich? 

Also, just in case you didn't hear, the Commission is scheduled to vote on 
Thursday the 14th on an order that would suspend direct access under the 
AB1x.  The expectation is that the vote will be delayed.  Best information 
says there are not enough votes to approve direct access suspension.

Harry (or anyone else that might know),
Can you help me understand what has gone on in the last week re:

1)  definitive view of exit fees and how they will be administered.  What is 
the probability of one proposed approach vs. others?

2) definitive view of core / non core decisions?  when are they coming?  How 
might they influence our actions with the existing contracts.  Probability of 
one proposal passing  and when?  
David W Delainey
06/11/2001 06:02 PM
Guys, I assume that we are managing all new and old California contracts with 
this potential issue in mind.  This plus the exit fees could be a significant 
issue.   Let me know if we need a broader discussion.

Regards
Delainey

Thanks, Zenee.  I will participate by phone.

In particular, would be nice to know how much of the "wealth transfer" went 
to the likes of LADWP, other CA munis, Calpine, and the federal government 
(e.g., BPA, Salt River).  Finally, how much did the utilities profit from the 
high prices (i.e., from selling their excess gen into the PX)?  

Best,

Seabron - 

Here is an outline of the work product we would like you to consider --

1. How much did the LACK OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP / LUNACY cost California 
consumers?
 + LUNACY = CPUC did not accept $60/Mwh last year 
 + unwillingness to fix credit problems
 + Bad CDWR buying habits
 + other

2. Analyze key Cal ISO studies dealing with "overearning" and market abuse.
 + Methodological faults
 + Analyze Key Findings
 + Develop appropriate "Enron" responses

3. Develop framework to assist in responding to political "calls" for market 
controls
 + Understand better who "won" from the WEALTH TRANSFER
 + How much was transferred to "Texas generators"?

4. Other fixes still needed
 + A/S markets in California
 + Governance issues
 + other?

I hope this helps frame the work.

After months of effort, we have succeeded in putting together a Blackout
Notification System that will provide California employers, residents, and
public safety officers with adequate time to respond to an impending rolling
blackout.

As you know, Governor Davis appointed me to the California ISO last
February. Through the leadership of our Energy Committee at the
Manufacturing Group, I introduced a motion at CAISO on March 30. The motion
stated that California needed a better Blackout Notification System than the
passive system previously in place.  After the motion passed 5-0, the ISO
and PG&E held focus groups with employers and residents throughout the state
to ask customers what they need to more adequately prepare for planned
rolling blackouts, and if possible to help prevent them from occurring.

Then, Governor Davis stepped in and directed ISO, the Office of Emergency
Services, and the Energy Oversight Board to work with the utilities to build
a proactive notification system.  This system provides not only a 1-hour
advanced warning before a blackout could occur, but to also includes 48 and
24-hour notices that blackouts might happen due to predicted hot weather
conditions, and/or a lack of energy supply, or planned and unplanned
maintenance at generation facilities.  The proactive approach sought by
Governor Davis and by my motion at CAISO will include a system by which
residents and employers can have their extensive contact information such
e-mails, pagers, and cell phones listed in a database.  All contacts can
receive a 48, 24 and 1-hour automatic notification in advance.

What is particularly exciting about this proactive approach is that we can
better prepare for a blackout with adequate time to power down assembly
lines and computers, and power up emergency generators. We can also prevent
a blackout by taking action within that hour which reduces load and can even
help avoid blackouts.

Again, kudos go to the Manufacturing Group's Energy Committee for pushing
this plan last February to take to the CAISO Board and to Governor Davis. By
expanding this plan, we can make sure an even larger window of notice is
proactively provided to Californians.  The plan will be rolled out publicly
tomorrow (Friday, June 15, 2001) and incrementally implemented as soon as
possible. We will soon provide further updates on how employers throughout
the Valley and state on how they can register in the new database for this
proactive notification system.

Sincerely,

Carl Guardino

Thanks Madeleine.  What a great picture and so perfect for Lari to marry on
horseback!

Here's the tally for the weekend of Sept. 23 and preferred riding schedules:

Cal and me -- at least Sat and Sun, prefer 1/2 day ride each day, one on
beach, one in forest, but also okay with one full day forest (Sat) and half
day beach (Sun).
Madeleine  -- all day Sat. and 1/2 day Sun.
Pippa Murray -- interested (not sure of her riding preference).
Pat -- interested but cannot commit until the date is closer.
Nora -- interested in a 1/2 day ride but cannot commit until date is closer.
Not interested in "man from snowy river" route.
Alice -- can't make it.

I have not heard from the others.  Anyone else want to join?

Accommodations:   Because of the uncertain numbers, it looks like getting a
house to rent would not work.  As for B&B or hotel accommodations, I think I
might prefer being closer to Fort Bragg than Howard Creek Ranch.  It might
make sense to reserve rooms at a couple of places and decide later when
we've heard more definitively from the group....  I'll scout around this
week and see what's still available, and let you all know.

Riding:  Based on the above, unless someone tells me differently today, I'll
tell the ranch we have five people for an all-day Sat (Cal, me, Madeleine,
Pippa, Pat), and six for half-day Sunday (same plus Nora).  We can always
cancel later if we have to.

Tally ho!

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/18/2001 
GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH SDG&E, SEMPRA ENERGY 
$400-$12,000 Per Customer Balloon Payment Eliminated, No Additional Rate
Increases Required to Pay Off Undercollection 
SACRAMENTO 
Governor Gray Davis today announced an agreement with San Diego Gas &
Electric and the utility's parent company, Sempra Energy, that will erase a
$747 million balloon payment facing the utility's three million customers. 
"The balloon is burst," Governor Davis said. "Under this agreement, the
undercollection is eliminated, without any increase in rates. This is a
massive benefit to the San Diegans, the first Californians to bear the brunt
of our state's energy crisis last summer."
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), signed by the Department of Water
Resources for Gov. Davis with Sempra Energy and SDG&E executives while a
group of San Diego ratepayers, and State Senators Steve Peace (D-El Cajon)
and Dede Alpert (D-Coronado) looked on, includes a number of provisions to
eliminate the undercollection that could have cost each customer
approximately $750 (as much as $400 for each residential customer, $1,400
for each small-commercial customer and $12,000 for each medium-sized
commercial customer). 
In addition, it would settle several regulatory cases before the California
Public Utilities Commission (PUC), gives the State the opportunity to
purchase 15,780 acres of environmentally-sensitive lands owned by the
company along the Colorado River, and provides below-market power to the
State through December 2010 from the San Onofre nuclear power plant. The
regulatory provisions are subject to PUC approval.
It also calls for the purchase of SDG&E's transmission lines for
approximately $1 billion, or 2.3 times book value. However, the deal is not
contingent on that purchase of SDG&E's transmission network, which includes
170 electric lines exceeding 69 kilovolts in capacity and spans
approximately 1,800 circuit miles from southern Orange County to the Mexican
border. The system also includes about 135 electric substations and
transmission interties with Southern California Edison's system at the San
Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
"Throughout these long and complex negotiations, Governor Davis and we have
had the mutual objective of reducing the financial impact of California's
crisis on SDG&E's customers and helping the State gain more control over its
energy destiny," said Stephen L. Baum, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Sempra Energy. "Today's agreement represents a winning
proposition for our customers, the State and our company: it reduces the
future financial burden on our customers, protects the State's economic
future, and creates a clear path for future growth and profitability for our
company. Going forward, we are committed to working with Governor Davis and
the State to implement his recovery plan."
The MOU signed today is the second with California's investor-owned
utilities. An agreement with Southern California Edison is pending approval
before the State Legislature. Unlike the Edison agreement, however, the MOU
with Sempra Energy does not need legislative approval (except for the
acquisition of transmission lines). 
"This is an example of the good that can come when parties are responsible
and remain at the bargaining table," Governor Davis said. "This is a
balanced business transaction that benefits ratepayers and provides a stable
environment for the State's third largest utility."
Governor Davis said the MOU will not result in any additional
electric-base-rate increases for SDG&E customers to recover the $750 million
undercollection. Without the MOU, future balloon payments to recover this
sum could have been as much as $750 per customer.
The regulatory balancing account for SDG&E's undercollected power costs had
grown to approximately $750 million since September 2000, when the State
imposed a retail rate cap of 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, retroactive to May
2000. California state law AB 265, signed by Governor Davis last year,
provided for SDG&E's recovery of all its prudently incurred power costs, but
delegated responsibility to the PUC for determining the method and timeline
for recovery.
The agreement includes a complex package of elements to eliminate the
balloon payment, such as the settlement of the reasonableness-review case
SDG&E had with the PUC. To settle that case, the utility has agreed to
forego collecting $100 million of the balancing account. 
In addition, the agreement notes that: 
SDG&E agrees to give back 90 percent of the profits on two long-term power
contracts earned since the energy crisis flared last June. That means SDG&E
will forego collecting another $219 million in the balancing account. (The
California Department of Water Resources will purchase those contracts as of
June 1.); 
SDG&E and its sister utility, SoCalGas, will invest at least $3 billion over
six years into capital improvements. In addition, if the State decides not
buy the transmission lines (and 
SDG&E builds the Valley Rainbow line) the utility, backed by Sempra Energy,
will put another $500 million into transmission line improvements, subject
to PUC approval). Excluding the transmission system improvements, this is an
increase of $600 million more than the utilities invested in capital
improvements in the previous five years; and 
SDG&E will drop all legal claims against the State. 
"We know that many of our customers are extremely concerned about the
potential of large balloon payments looming in the future to address our
past undercollections," said Edwin A. Guiles, group president of Sempra
Energy's regulated business units and chairman of SDG&E. "We are pleased
that today's agreement provides the framework to resolve major regulatory
issues to the benefit of our customers. Many challenges remain, but, this
agreement demonstrates that, by working together, we can surmount these
challenges in a way that benefits all the key stakeholders in California's
energy future."
The MOU also calls for the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to continue
to buy power for SDG&E through the agency until certain conditions are met.
DWR has been purchasing power for SDG&E customers since early February.
SDG&E is a regulated utility operating in San Diego and southern Orange
counties. Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE), based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500
energy services holding company with annualized 2001 revenues of about $13
billion. Through its eight principal subsidiaries - Southern California Gas
Company, San Diego Gas & Electric, Sempra Energy Solutions, Sempra Energy
Trading, Sempra Energy International, Sempra Energy Resources, Sempra
Communications and Sempra Energy Financial - the Sempra Energy companies'
12,000 employees serve more than nine million customers in the United
States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America and Asia.

Let's discuss further, but I believe that the tariff would be a "generic" one 
for network service, with the price, terms and conditions dependent upon the 
size and other attributes of the customer.  Not aware of any negotiated rates 
available from the US/Mex border to the burner tip in S.D.

Jeff,

We've obtained a tariff filing that Sempra made with the CRE in Mexico to 
determine the transportation rates charged by Sempra International to 
transport gas in Mexico.  Can you help us determine the transport rate 
charged to move gas from the California border to the Mexican border through 
Socal and SDG&E?  I understand that SDG&E may be able to negotiate a rate 
that includes the fee paid to Socal?  Is that correct?

What I'm trying to determine is what will be the rate for us to obtain a 
backhaul from a new LNG regas terminal in Mexico, through the Sempra 
International pipeline in Mexico and through SDG&E, to an end user behind 
Socal?  Do you know how this works or do you have a suggestion on how we can 
determine the max rates, plus determine what "actual" rates have been 
negotiated?  We have discussions with Sempra this friday and want to table 
the issue of firm backhauls.

Thanks

Kurt

go ahead.  I've told her that I can't make it.

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the 
past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's 
electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small 
customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States 
Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to 
achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in 
California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from 
the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the 
utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers 
would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close 
devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the 
utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January 
and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR 
contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore 
structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the 
contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large 
customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR 
contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to 
address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) 
killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure 
focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not 
include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any 
"out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract 
provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the 
state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might 
reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear 
that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally 
abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some 
options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the 
core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM 
PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let 
me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

Glad to hear that there's a meeting set up.  My apologies again.  I'm very 
wrapped up in trying to help solve California's electricity crisis.  Don't 
hesitate if there's anything else that I can help out with.

Enron company.  They are selling themselves as a complete RFP and

<<DealBench.url>> 

David H,
Here's a wrapup of my meeting with DealBench two weeks ago.  I left a
voicemail for Cameron yesterday asking her how to proceed with them, as this
would become a BizDev deal with a perceived competitor.
On another note, the 2 EES Proc Mgrs that Jim F and I met with a couple of
weeks ago, mentioned that they have an initiative on the table to run a
reverse auction by July 15, and that they are considering BayBuilder.  They
said they don't care about the DealBench platform, it doesn't meet their
needs and DealBench isn't giving any better deal to Enron's business units
than they would to anyone else off the street.
Ian and I are trying to schedule a meeting next Tuesday with Proc Mgrs from
several business units along with John Gillespie from GSS in order to demo
Perfect Insight and discuss our Early Adopter Program.
David Young
Met for 45 min w Suresh Raghavan to discuss DealBench (Enron's proprietary
auction platform) and the potential for Perfect to provide complementary
solutions to their customers through EnronOnline and beyond.  We agreed that
the purpose of our discussions would not be to have him sponsor us to the
Global Strategic Sourcing unit, but only to consider Perfect as a bus dev
deal.  We would need to price ourselves as an ASP for them, but with the
liquidity they have (supposedly like $1B per day traded through
EnronOnline), this should be a no-brainer.
Suresh is the Principal of DealBench, as well as a Director of Enron Net
Works.  DealBench is one of many business units under the Enron Wholesale
Services / Enron Net Works group, including EnronOnline, ClickPaper,
MetalMarkets, and other wholesale marketplace services.  DealBench has 3
primary offerings:
* Auctioning/RFQ management
* Deal Rooms with complex negotiations tools
* Data Rooms  for sharing of secure documents such as CADs, blue prints, etc
for M&A due diligence.

We discussed the basic functionality and sophisticated math behind Perfect,
and he felt that it was worth considering further as a complementary service
offering for the DealBench platform.  He would like to arrange a demo for
him and some of his managers for the end of June or early July.

Anyone in the market for a $400 hammer?

Alan:

I'd like to use the info ( i.e., "we think the contracts are $XX billion out 
of the money") in the context of the negotiations that I'm in and I'd also 
like to tell Hertzberg---it will provide a powerful and compelling case to do 
something about the contracts in order to 1) save the State's rear end and 2) 
ensure that the core/noncore structure remains alive. I wouldn't hand out any 
paper showing any analysis.  How long would it take to refine?

I pulled the recent forward curves (confidential; not for external release 
without approval from West Power) and computed the stranded costs associated 
with the DWR contracts.  Assuming SP15 on peak (which is conservative since 
many of the contracts had off peak energy in them) the total overmarket is 
$21 billion, or $13 billion discounted at 12%.  The former number is most 
comparable to the $40+ billion DWR expenditure commitement number.

If we want to use this for any sort of external message I would like to 
refine further.

Alan

Recall that at 4:05 PM on Wednesday, June 27th, we are scheduled to see the 
Giants clobber the bums.

Please don't use this yet.  Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but 
wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the DWR contracts are (if 
marked to market today).  Jim's got it , too.

Based on recent curves, $21B of the DWR contracts are stranded.  Will give 
you the update once it's done (likely tomorrow).

Best,
Jeff

Let's do it. I'll do my darnedest to make it.

SCE Reaches Agreement With Alternative Energy Generators

PR Newswire
06/19/01, 11:20p
(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)

ROSEMEAD, Calif., June 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern California Edison (SCE) 
announced today that it has reached an agreement with most of its renewable 
Qualifying Facilities (QF) power producers that addresses past payment issues 
and future pricing considerations, and creates a mechanism for ending 
numerous lawsuits.

"We believe this agreement will help bring stability to an important segment 
of California's energy market," said SCE Chairman, President & CEO Stephen E. 
Frank.

The plan was negotiated between the utility and key representatives of the QF 
industry and facilitated by Governor Gray Davis' office. To date, SCE has 
received signed agreements from QFs representing approximately 95% of its 
renewable energy capacity and today executed those contracts. The company 
hopes that the small number of remaining producers will also agree. Certain 
elements of the agreements are subject to the approval of the California 
Public Utilities Commission.

The plan calls for generators to provide power at a fixed price -- 5.37 
cents/kWh -- over the next five years, eliminating some of the price 
volatility that has plagued California's energy markets during the current 
crisis. The plan stays all existing legal action, and assures that no new 
legal action will be initiated unless the terms of the agreement are not met.

"The people of Edison are committed to pursuing the benefits of negotiated 
practical solutions to California's energy crisis," said Frank. "The QF 
agreement and the MOU, if approved, are critical steps toward resolving the 
crisis. A bankruptcy, in contrast, would lead to years of delay and 
uncertainty for our customers and raise serious questions about the business 
climate in California." 

An Edison International company, Southern California Edison is one of the 
nation's largest electric utilities, serving a population of more than 11 
million via 4.3 million customer accounts in a 50,000-square-mile service 
area within central, coastal and Southern California.

Problem is that core has enough through utility retained gen and QF contracts 
and "noncore" is going to market, so they don't need any of it, which means 
it's both above market and not needed.

jeff,

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed 
by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the 
deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the 
energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute 
the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that 
recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery 
period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below 
a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.  

Phillip
PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the 
past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's 
electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small 
customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States 
Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to 
achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in 
California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from 
the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the 
utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers 
would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close 
devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the 
utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January 
and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR 
contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore 
structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the 
contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large 
customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR 
contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to 
address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) 
killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure 
focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not 
include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any 
"out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract 
provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the 
state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might 
reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear 
that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally 
abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some 
options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the 
core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM 
PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let 
me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

Greetings:

This item will be up for discussion in the California negotiations tomorrow 
beginning at 10 AM.

We're going to have a call to discuss it tomorrow from 9 AM to 9:30 AM PDT.  
You will receive a  call-in number shortly from Joseph Alamo.  If there are 
others who you think ought to participate, please feel free to invite them.  
Thanks.

Jeff,
Aside from a potentially more viable purchaser of curtailment in the CDWR, 
are there any new concerns that you have with us participating in the ISO DRP 
program..... we are presently getting ready to execute contracts with 
Homestake Mining and a second EOP / Johnson and Johnson contract covering 
another 10MW of curtailment and I thought it appropriate to check with you 
(like we did prior to the first signing).  I'm primarily interested in 
whether or not you are concerned about this being consistent with our other 
efforts.
Thanks,

Summary

The California ISO has sought to provide greater security for  their 
financial commitments in the DRP Programs.
The "CDWR/CERS has concluded that it will not provide backing for the program 
as it is now designed."
"When details of a modified program design by CDWR/CERS become available, the 
ISO will permit parties with signed DRAs to "convert" to the new program by 
terminating the DRA and signing a new agreement", if they so choose.
Until then, "payments [will be] made to participants from market funds 
received from Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) on a pay-when-paid basis pursuant 
to DRA Section 6.2."
Enron will continue to work within the ISO program until a new program is 
defined.  At that time, we will review the alternatives, determine the best 
financial alternative and propose said alternative to our curtailable load.

See the communication at the bottom of this e-mail from the ISO for more 
specifics.

 Press Release 
   
OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR 
PR01: 285
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/10/2001 

GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE 

Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans 

LOS ANGELES 

Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes 
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary, 
emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large 
businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power 
emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating 
customers. 

"Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor 
Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even 
avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources 
to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they 
voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."

The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent 
load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent 
System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned 
Utilities. 

The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer 
2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be 
determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the 
amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated 
to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of 
customers who sign up.

Notice to Winning Bidders in the California ISO's Summer 2001 Demand Relief
Program (DRP):

Over the last few weeks, Loads participating in the ISO's Demand Relief
Program raised the question of financial backing of payments for
participation in the program.  As you know, under the current version of the
ISO's Demand Relief Agreement (DRA), costs of the DRP are charged to metered
Demand including exports, and payments are made to participants from market
funds received from Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) on a pay-when-paid basis
pursuant to DRA Section 6.2.  In response to the concerns over backing by a
creditworthy party, the ISO approached the California Department of Water
Resources (CDWR/CERS) to provide this financial backing.

CDWR/CERS has concluded that it will not provide backing for the program as
it is now designed.  Discussions continue with CDWR/CERS and it appears that
backing may be provided, albeit for a modified program design.  The ISO will
publish details of such modified program when they become available.

With respect to Loads under Demand Relief Agreements that have been signed
by both the Load aggregator and the ISO, the Load aggregator can choose to
remain under the existing agreement's terms, which do not include credit
support.  In that case, the ISO will deem the DRA to be in full force and
effect, and subject to the uncertainty of payment timeframe under the
pay-when-paid provisions.  Alternatively, the ISO will allow Load
aggregators to terminate their Demand Relief Agreements if they provide
written notice to the ISO by June 13, 2001.  If the ISO does not receive
notice of termination from the Load aggregator by June 13, the ISO will
dispatch the Loads in accordance with the terms of the existing DRA.

With respect to Loads for which DRAs have not been signed by both the ISO
and the aggregator, the ISO is willing to go forward with the signing of
DRAs with such parties under the existing terms, which, again, do not
include credit support.  Aggregators wishing to go forward on such terms
should contact the ISO as soon as possible.

When details of a modified program design by CDWR/CERS become available, the
ISO will permit parties with signed DRAs to "convert" to the new program by
terminating the DRA and signing a new agreement.  Additionally, the ISO will
offer the same opportunity to participate in the new program to winning
bidders in the ISO DRP that choose not to sign the existing DRA.  We will
provide details regarding the new design and contract terms as soon as they
are completed.

FYI.  Hertzberg and Keeley were in the negotiations this morning.  We gave 
him an earful about this coming down the pike, and the fact that the 
contracts (which are too expensive and which no one wants) are driving 
everything and unless something gives, we can pack it up, go home and turn 
the keys over the Freeman and his bozos at DWR.  

The Sacramento types are mobilized on the issue and Hertzberg said that he's 
going to meet with the Governor and call Loretta.  We meet again tomorrow at 
10 to discuss the need to get rid of the contracts and to keep DA alive.  
I'll report back with any pertinent info.

Does the term renewable refer to only wind/biomass? or does it include the 
gas fired cogen's. The answer to this is extremely important? How soon can 
you answer this question? What part of the contracts require CPUC approval 
(the fixed price?) Is the fixed price the energy component only or does it 
include the capacity payment?

Enron CEO gets pie in the face from a protester

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A Texas energy executive got more than boos and jeers 
before starting a speech on California's energy crisis, he got a pie in the 
face. 
Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., was nailed 
with a pie by a protester at the beginning of his speech at the Commonwealth 
Club of California. 
?

Enron has come under fire after accusations from Gov. Gray Davis and state 
officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices 
skyward by holding back supply. 
Enron has denied such claims, and joined other power producers in arguing 
that the state and utilities owes them billions in unpaid bills. 
Davis acknowledged that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has declared 
bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such 
as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past 
electricity sales. 
State officials countered that wholesalers charged as much as $9 billion in 
illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000. The feuding groups are to meet 
in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out 
agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided. 

I'll be off on Friday, but will be checking in for messages and will be 
equipped with pager.

The Honorable Joseph Dunn
Chair, Senate Select Committee
California State Senate
Room 2080
California State Capitol
Sacramento, CA 95814

Dear Senator Dunn:

Earlier this year, you met individually with IEP and various other parties to 
explain the purpose of the Senate Select Committee?s hearing and the process 
under which they were to be conducted.  You made it very clear that you were 
planning to have fact-finding hearings based upon fundamental fairness and 
due process.  You made a further commitment that there would be no 
surprises.  Prior to today, the hearings have been conducted consistent with 
that representation.

Unfortunately, today it appears that the Committee has set a new course that 
radically departs from these previous commitments.  Today, the Committee is 
hearing testimony from several surprise witnesses.  These witnesses are 
former employees of San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) under contract with 
Duke Energy for an interim period during which Duke Energy operated the 
facilities in San Diego.   It is our understanding that these former contract 
employees are alleging that the company failed to properly maintain these 
facilities, and they are alleging that Duke Energy cycled these facilities 
differently than the former owner, SDG&E.  It is also our understanding that 
Duke Energy will not be afforded the opportunity to contemporaneously 
challenge these allegations and/or provide an explanation as to the 
operational behavior of the facilities.  In short, the hearings are being 
reduced to a media event, giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of 
disgruntled ex-employees.

Respectfully, it would appear that the Committee has wandered far afield of 
its stated goals.  These hearings have the potential of identifying what went 
wrong with California?s energy policy and how to fix it.  However, this will 
only occur if this inquiry is based on informal facts and complete 
information, not innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations.  It is the pursuit 
of facts, not headlines, which will solve California?s energy crisis.  These 
facts will be revealed only in a fair process, where allegations made are 
subject to contemporaneous response.  

It is our hope that today?s process is an aberration, and not a departure 
from your commitments.  The Committee is at a crossroads.  It can choose to 
engage in fact-finding and analysis, or it can be reduced to a witch-hunt in 
pursuit of headlines.  For the benefit of all Californian?s, the Committee 
should focus on fact-finding and analysis.

Sincerely,

Jan Smutny-Jones

Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis 
Energy advisers have ruthless reputation

No matter how much you try to spin the facts, the truth usually topples out. 
This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout, 
because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader, who, quite 
equitably, is suffering his own power crisis. 
Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting black-and-white 
problem. How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy 
crisis sooner, his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and 
power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response 
to spend $40 million in public funds to purchase future electricity without 
offering consumers the details of the pact? 
The truth is, he cannot, although he has tried mightily. And to that end he 
made one of his biggest mistakes yet -- no small feat when you consider he is 
at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in California's 
history. 
Rather than tackle the issues head-on, Davis did what he has always done: use 
consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public 
opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his 
problems. It's a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a 
mere weekend hobbyist. 
Davis' decision to hire two former Clinton-Gore spin doctors to explain away 
his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summer's threat 
of rolling blackouts. If only, in this case, he could have kept his critics 
in the dark. 
While the state's taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills, Davis was 
pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might 
conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power 
suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers 
dry. 
It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help 
the nation's most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November. 
And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were 
being Snopes-like in their dealings with the Golden State. 
But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated 
California's energy plight through his own inaction -- as evidenced by our 
sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and 
spiraling electricity costs early last summer. 
Yet why suffer the facts when it's so much easier to just scramble them? 
When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis' popularity ratings 
began short-circuiting, he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, who had 
been as ubiquitous in the scandal-ridden Clinton administration as the stain 
on a certain intern's dress. 
The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the 
press each day that they earned the label "masters of disaster" -- which may 
be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to 
envelop him. If only he had considered the accompanying stink. 
Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing 
less than ruthless, partisan hired guns, happy to attack anyone standing 
between them and a monthly paycheck. 
Unfortunately for Davis, the rhetorical hit men's salaries are being paid by 
California taxpayers, who are none too happy that they will be socked with 
billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis' lack of 
leadership. 
So although Lehane and Fabiani's $30,000 monthly consulting fees may look 
paltry to a governor who has contributed to California's lost billions, it 
looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats, 
sometimes known as California's 30 million-plus residents. 
The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group from 
Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political 
Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California 
Edison as consultants -- a generally accepted no-no for public officials, 
even those who worked in Washington. 
And State Controller Kathleen Connell, a fellow Democrat, has rightfully 
refused to pay state funds for the Clinton-Gore castoffs, because she said it 
is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy -- not politics 
- - as required by law. 
Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of 
ethics, it's fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground. Or as one member 
of a tax protest group put it: "We are adding insult to injury to have the 
governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough 
for damage control." 
Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage, but right now Davis is 
a metal helmet in an electrical storm. His arrogant treatment of state 
voters, his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his 
way out of trouble has left even die-hard Democrats searching for a more 
palatable replacement. 
That decision will come next year when Davis is up for re-election. And the 
millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice 
will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas. 
Since the governor is involved, it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale. 
But by the time the spin doctors are through, it may start to sound more like 
an urban legend.

Hi Steven,

 Attached is the first of four documents that we have prepared for
the focus groups.  All of the exercises are works in progress and I am
sending them to you for comments. (Hopefully, we are on the right track.)
As we discussed, I am happy to fly down to Houston tomorrow so that we can
review these materials together.  If, however, you feel that we can edit the
exercises via email that's fine too. Just let me know which arrangement
makes you the most sense to you. Hope all is well.

Regards,

Liz

If it's no cost to Enron, and if he's good and willing to commute to SF, and 
if it would be beneficial to the Company, we could certainly use the help and 
put him to work on interesting things.  

But do we we want to infect someone with the lunacy of California regulation 
and then potentially infect the UK?  Seriously, we can make it work if folks 
think that it makes sense.

Thanks, John.  Couple of things.  

First, I was involved with the analysis in point number one (i.e., if 
California had bought at 5 cents.....), but would be happy to discuss with 
those who worked on it.

Second, we've just about go the numbers scrubbed for #2 (working with Comnes 
and Tribolet on that analysis). Key to the "back up" on point number two will 
be internal sign off on releasing information that uses our curves as the 
benchmark in the mark to market assessment.  I'm checking with Steve Kean on 
that and will get back to you ASAP.

Just following up on the Monday conference call discussion yesterday with 
Rick and others about nailing down the numbers and documentation so we can 
feed the Hill information on the mistakes Governor Davis made last year and 
this year on power supply contracts.

As I understand it, there are two aspects of this:

 1. The offer of Enron and others last year to sell power to California 
utilities for 5 cents per kw.  Failure to accept these offers resulted in 
higher power costs in the range of $15 billion, as I recall from yesterday's 
call.

 2. The long term contracts that California signed this year after taking 
actions and making statements that drove up the forward price curves are now 
under water to the tune of $20 billion.

On both counts we will be pressed for assumptions and documentation to pursue 
these arguments, which parallel the comments made by senior management in 
Capitol Hill meeting last week.  We will work on back up on this end, but we 
would greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard as well. 

With Congress out of session starting COB on Thursday, we will need 
information pulled together by tomorrow COB to get the final product in the 
hands of congressional types and others who can use it on a timely basis.  
Thanks.

Please forward to Bev.  Thanks.

Much Calif Power Price Gouging Beyond FERC's Reach -ISO    
Updated: Monday, June 25, 2001 06:59 PM ET   Email this article to a friend! 
 Printer-friendly version  

By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion." 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky 
calculations." 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February: 

The story doesn't include the list of "overchargers."  Could you forward that 
part? Thanks.

As Mark mentioned, I would recommend Edward Barker.  He is closely involved 
in NETA and has a good understanding of power and gas markets. I also 
wouldn't be concerned about whether CA is relevant - it is a major issue here 
and on the Continent as the EU states begin to look at security of supply and 
how they can avoid "doing a California".  Edward is sufficiently bright and 
discerning to recognise any evidence he picks up in CA for what it is.

Based on the exchange of correspondence below, I will get back to Ian 
Fletcher and ask for Edward's CV etc and indicate that we would be prepared 
to consider a role in San Francisco (with some flexibility).  Please confirm 
that you are happy for me to progress this further with the DTI.

Thanks

Paul

Paul D. - fyi.  You should also ask Ian for a copy of his CV.   thanks  mcs

I'd like to see his resume.  I don't know that California work will be 
particularly informative--given the uniqueness of that great state, but we no 
doubt can find a use for his skills.  I would want to see his CV.  It would 
be a nonstarter for me if he was unwilling to travel to SFO or Portland on 
regular basis.  However, the travel could be 3-4 days a week--i.e., he could 
travel up on Monday and go home on Thursday.  (Or some other such schedule).  
What do you think?
Rick - I just got a call from Ian Fletcher, head of the Utilities Regulation 
unit at the UK Department of Trade and Industry.  He reports to Anna Walker, 
the Director General of Energy at the DTI.  Ian also knows Paul, and I am 
sure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location.  Anyway, 
here is what he asked:  They have a highly regarded junior civil servant, 
Edward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is 
getting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his 
fiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there.  The UK DTI will keep 
paying him, so he is effectively free to us.  They want a relevant job/work 
experience for him.  Ian does not know about his willingness to commute 
during the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to 
these kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check.  I think it 
would be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for 
endearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant 
to the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that 
is something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK.  I would think 
challenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo 
writing, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the 
policy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts?   I can 
get his CV when you need it.  thanks  mcs    

Go ahead without the gas, unless you can get into my American Express account 
and find out what those numbers are.  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff

Summary of Davis/Alpert bill AB 260

Retro-active to June 1, 2000 through December 31, 2002, 6.5 cent/kWh cap on 
the energy component for residential and small commercial customers (under 
100 kW).  The Commission has the ability to extend through 2003.  The 
Commission also has the ability to adjust the cap.

Commission can use revenues from utility-owned assets, refunds from FERC to 
offset the undercollections.  (In addition, a companion bill was passed that 
provides $150 million of general fund money to offset undercollections.)

Large commercial/industrial/agricultural customers have an opportunity to 
"opt-in" to the 6.5 cent/kWh cap with an annual true-up.

SDG&E will under a prudence review by the CPUC, which may be another source 
of funds to offset the undercollection.

Specific classes subject to cap:

  Schedule A, all acute care hospitals, all public and private k-12 schools, 
all accounts on AL-TOU under 100 kW.

Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties.  
Appropriate those funds from the subaccount, to the commission, to reduce the 
adverse impact of high-cost wholesale energy purchases on certain ratepayers 
if a specified rate ceiling is in effect, and if the commission determines 
that a specified revenue shortfall would result in a ratepayer surcharge 
greater than 10%, and the electricity rates were directly linked to Power 
Exchange costs.  
Declare that, on January 1, 2004, any remaining balance in the account would 
revert to the General Fund.
Become operative only if AB 265 is enacted, as specified.

Alan and I spoke about point #2 on the comparison benchmark.  At this point, 
we may be able to just say it is based on a comparison of the contracts with 
today's forward market and gloss over the exact forward curve we used.  Of 
course if there is a way to come up with a similar number using publicly 
available data (or if we are willing to provide our numbers if pressed) then 
all the better.  In the mean time, should I hold off on using the $13.8 
billion number until I hear back from you about the conversation with Steve?

Also, do I understand correctly from Alan that the $13.8 billion figure is 
NOT comparing the long term contracts California signed with recent spot 
market prices, but rather is a comparison of the contracts to our present 
forward pricing curves?  From you e-mail, it is the latter, I take it.

As to point #1, on the deal last year, we just need a similar "back of the 
envelope" calculation on what California could have saved had California 
taken us up on the offers we and others made.  Any guidance on where to get 
that would be most helpful.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion." 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky 
calculations." 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February:

Per our conversation, here's a copy of the curves that need updating.  If 
possible, could you get them to me by tomorrow afternoon?  Sorry for the 
rush.  Gotta talk on Thursday.  I want to superimpose on the curves the 
rates  that Loretta just put in place for 500 KW and above (for Edison and 
PG&E).  Can you do that if I get you the rates?  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff

plz call when u have a minute.  thx, jeff  415.505.6633

thank u.

what's the total load number (i.e., kwh total) you're using to arrive at the 
numbers that we went over on the phone, and where are you getting that 
number?  thanks.

best,
jeff

no.  call me.  415.505.6633.

Here are the latest stranded cost numbers.

This analysis is based on internal curves.  Please do not release without 
approval from Belden or S. Kean.  We will try to redo the analysis using 
public forward curve numbers but in the mean time ...

The biggest refinement is that I made an adjustment for the fact that many 
contracts are gas indexed and their price falls.  Both gas and electricity 
have fallen since DWR released their numbers in late May.  I was able to 
replicate the total contract cost of $41 billion, which gives me some 
confidence in the approximations I have made.

The bottom line numbers are out at columns AB to AF

Executed only, undiscounted and discounted ($million)
 8,098      6,456   
Executed and Agreement In Principal, undiscounted and discounted ($million)
 13,840     10,639 

In otherwords, the $20 billion number I quoted earlier is down to $13.8 
billion due to the adjustment for gas costs.

Comments welcome.

Jeff:

One of my senior colleagues is visiting San Francisco on July 2nd and 3rd,
with two senior members of the government of New South Wales (Australia) in
tow. Frontier are advising the NSW government on their electric
restructuring process. My coleague Danny Price is a real star on power
markets - he has worked on it for longer than I have even.

Inevitably, these people are interested in understanding the California
meltdown. We have scheduled for them to meet a range of folks in California,
including two of the CPUC Comissioners, Lorreta Lynch's chief of staff, Cal
ISO, PG&E, one of the generators, etc. They are forewarned that the CPUC and
Davis's office will be all political bluster.

Any chance they might catch up with someone from Enron for an hour? Could
buy you a nice lunch on Monday July 2nd? Enron has a substntial operation in
Australia but I guess that is a bit out of your balliwick.

I realize this is a very late (and unusual request) so I completely
understand if it is inconvenient or impossible.

Cheers

Dear Haas Students,

We still have many unclaimed tickets left for the Secretary Summers 
Research Dialogue Program "Keeping the Economy Growing" at 1:45 on Tuesday, 
December 6 in the Andersen Auditorium.

The deadline for Haas students to pick up tickets for this event is this 
Friday, December 1 at 2pm.

After the Friday deadline, we will offer all of the unclaimed tickets to 
other Cal students who have been clamoring for these tickets.

The Dean's Office is open from 9am to 5pm daily and Evening MBA students 
can pick up their tickets at the EMBA Office after 5pm.

Thanks for your cooperation!

 Thanks for your time, Sue.

 I hope I am not causing confusion - we also emailed Jeff Dasovich to
ask if he had time to talk with the Australians - he said he was going to
see what he could do.

 If you or Mr Dasovich might have time to give these guys a market
participant's view that would be great - at the moment they are only seeing
the CPUC, the CAISO and PG&E.

 Would you maybe have time to talk to them on Tuesday, July 3rd? They
could meet anytime between 1.00PM up to 4.00PM and then they need to head
off to the airport. Maybe they could take either of you out for lunch?

 Best wishes,

 Sabine.

I appreciate the efforts, but I have questions about whether Enron's presence 
does more harm than it does good.  I don't think that we want to give Wood 
and/or Brown a soap box to stand on by showing our face there.  Others may 
have a different view of it, but I think that it needs to be consumers, 
consumers, consumers.  Thoughts?

Officials criticize energy report 
Posted at 8:06 p.m. PDT Thursday, June 28, 2001 
BY CHRIS O'BRIEN 

Mercury News 

California's energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment, reduce 
production and aggravate an already weakening economy, according to 
researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles. 
The impact, however, will likely depend on how state officials choose to deal 
with the failed deregulation scheme. The authors of the report released 
Thursday come down heavily in favor of lifting price controls and 
dramatically increasing the price consumers pay as a way to reduce the 
economic fallout. 
``California's economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weather 
the current power crisis without being derailed,'' the report says. 
``However, our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an 
approach that does not shift today's problems to tomorrow.'' 
The study, ``Short Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the 
State's Economy,'' came under fierce criticism from Gov. Gray Davis' office. 
Steven Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said many of the assumptions used to 
produce the report are either outdated or flat wrong. 
``It deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust,'' 
Maviglio said. ``Like any crystal-ball report, it's essentially irrelevant.'' 
Edward Lamer, a UCLA professor, and Christopher Thornberg, a visiting 
professor at UCLA, collaborated on the report with a team of researchers from 
the Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The study concludes that California's gross state product will be cut by 
anywhere from .7 percent to 1.5 percent in 2001 as a result of the energy 
crisis. In addition, energy problems will increase unemployment by .5 percent 
in 2001 and 1.1 percent in 2002. The report predicts consumers can expect 112 
hours of rolling blackouts this year. 
However, the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if 
the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the 
wholesale costs. This could reduce blackouts to 12 hours, lower the debt and 
interest the state will have to pay for electricity and encourage investment 
in the state to increase energy supplies. 
But Peter Navarro, a management professor at the University of 
California-Irvine, was skeptical of the report's findings. He said it was 
almost impossible to build models complex enough to take into account all the 
factors that affect energy prices in the state. 
In addition, he said the report seems to assume that there is no manipulation 
of the current market, which Navarro argues could be distorting prices as 
well. 
``How do you justify raising retail rates to 45 cents for power that costs a 
nickel to generate when there is some evidence that the market is flawed?'' 
Navarro said. ``This report seems to have an industry point of view and an 
industry agenda.'' 

FYI.  Leg deal in CA running into trouble.  Davis/Freeman are problems.  Reps 
ain't playing nice.  Working on it. More later.  Best, Jeff

JOD - still in Monterey??? didya go to the Acquarium or something??

Let's discuss further.  I've been in close contact with Chris on this.  I'm 
not sure that we necessarily need a "presentation" on the issue.  Speaking 
only for California, policy makers and industry participants know a) that 
there's a problem and b) that the magnitude of the problem is significant, 
and there's not a heckuvalot of leg work that needs to be done on that 
front.  I would suggest that we continue to work on analysis internally, and 
spend some time discussing further the extent to which we need a presentation 
for external consumption.  As everyone's aware, this issue is a very 
complicated one and sensitive one for Enron and we need to be very careful 
w.r.t. how we approach it.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I got a call from Dow Jones today about a price we had posted on EnronOnline 
for day-ahead power at Mead for $105/MWh (the FERC proxy price is $91.87).  I 
talked to Tim Belden and just because an offer is posted doesn't mean that 
there's been a transaction.  Turns out that under our interpretation of the 
FERC order, because Friday for Monday transactions exceed the 24-hour 
delivery requirement, we believe they're exempt from the order.  Tim said 
that at the end of today, we had done five transactions above the cap, but 
they decided to lower the transaction price to the proxy price so we'd reduce 
any further exposure and scrutiny.

agreed.

Yep.  It's moving along.  The budget, and the R's desire to mess with Davis,

Gang:

The final letter and document will be given to the Speaker shortly.  As you
may know, TURN ultimately decided not to participate.  Also, late last week
the Utility Workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not
enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline.

The Speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the PUC
not to close the door on direct access and, if necessary, convince the
Legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program (if the PUC
goes south on us).  Also, I believe he hopes that our work will help
convince the Legislature to move to restore SCE to financial stability - and
to do so rapidly.

This last month has been very interesting to me - "oddly satisfying" is how
I described it, even if most of you did object to the phrasing - and I
appreciate the opportunity of working with you.  For whatever reasons, there
is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me
interested.  Thanks very much for participating.

Thanks, Hedy. Barring any strange turn of events, we're likely to be OK with 
the language.  The budget--and the R's desire to mess with Davis--appear to 
be delaying things somewhat.  If tomorrow Loretta holds the DA decision till 
the 12th, that will buy some additional  (and necessary) time to work a deal.

I need to visit with Republicans to urge their support as soon as

Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and 
apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and 
Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a 
comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). 

In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides 
more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly 
challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much 
more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. 

That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the 
plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of 
August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough 
time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in 
time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant 
energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides 
refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  
This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and 
now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.

Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting 
the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as 
soon as I have more information on that.

Best,
Jeff

The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that 
puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.  The memo says that the 
CPUC does not need to act on the key issues, including suspension of DA, 
until Aug 13 or later.  It also says the bonds are now to be sold in 
Sept-Oct. The memo states that the CPUC, Governor, Treasurer, etc. have 
agreed with the new timetable.

If you have any questions, please contact Charles Fitzpatrick at (800)

 - Investor Memo -- Timetable Update 7-2-01.pdf

FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to 
Aug. , with "effective date" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals 
process.  Do others have a similar or different view?  Do we intend to stay 
in touch, in view of the fact that there's been some "breathing room" 
provided by the PUC delaying its DA vote, and given the heavy lifting that is 
still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through?  

Happy 4th to all.

It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity 
to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to 
exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's 
customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on 
the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just 
want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get 
an amendment here.

Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply 
"to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ..."  
I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to 
either 

1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act, 
or 
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer 
classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing 
requirements.

The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who 
have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE 
customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can 
give you some specific language.)

Knowing your swamped and all ... did you respond to this e-mail or contact 
Phillip Allen?

Paul and Jeff,

Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss 
FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than 
federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.

He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the 
CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In 
the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being 
done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and 
probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not 
participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I 
am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.

Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core 
load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account 
the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core 
and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.

Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be 
appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.

From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking 
up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

Thanks.

important, I don't see the CPUC doing anything in the near-term to help fix 
the problems.

Paul and Jeff,

Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss 
FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than 
federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.

He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the 
CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In 
the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being 
done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and 
probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not 
participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I 
am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.

Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core 
load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account 
the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core 
and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.

Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be 
appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.

From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking 
up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

Thanks.

Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page 
and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the 
language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime 
in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.

Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments.
Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) 
capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to 
provide the specific language).
I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore 
deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll 
provide legislative language shortly .
Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have 
Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers 
never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a 
compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date 
certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid 
balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I 
know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a 
help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 
days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order 
establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power 
delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction 
of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by 
suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to 
the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be 
exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the 
duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus 
if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective 
date of this legislation" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct 
such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue 
requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the 
revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond 
revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR 
bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If 
we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be 
necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR 
costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, 
would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the 
clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and 
disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived 
from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the 
bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the 
bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in 
California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to 
recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such 
that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the 
amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take 
precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund 
and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 
2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

chk fax machine for Sher's bond language.  See email, too.  jeff

thanks for everything.  really 'ppreciate it, 'migo.   and please thank 
karen, too.  also, would you tell her that prentice and i are willing and 
able (we think) to help out in any way we can in putting the fireplace stuff 
together----i.e., anything that doesn't require real skill, like sticking 
tiles on the board.  just let us know.

Thanks.  As you know, I'm in the negotiations.  It's the best chance there is 
to 1) get a real market and 2) keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  Whether 
California can execute on it is another story.  But we're trying damned hard 
to make it happen.  IEP should support it.  Anything that you can do with Jan 
would be useful and appreciated.

The attached is the final product of the discussions which have been
occurring between the various consumer groups attempting to keep Edsion
solvent while retaining some potential for direct access.  IEP has
participated in some of these discussions.
IEP is being asked to sign this letter. It is time sensitive because of
pending PUC action on Direct Access.

I don't know whether or not you read  the article I sent about contesting
the election,  but I went a step further and listened to and watched the
video associated with that article.  The first  lawyer, Earl Carroll, who
spoke against contesting the election during the James Baker press
conference, used  the argument that many ballots from other counties in
Florida and other states contained no vote for President.  He called them
"non votes."  Therefore, we shouldn't think it unusual for that to happen in
the counties where Gore wants the recount.  What kind of sophistry and
deception is this?  Democrats and all fair-minded people are being
hornswoggled and bamboozled by this kind of propaganda.  It makes me think
that Goebles (I forget how he spelled his name) was really an amateur.  I'm
afraid we're not going to be able to combat this.  Democrats are not devious
enough to anticipate what Bush's strategists may do next.

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct

The Dunn Committee will be taking up the contempt citations again on Tuesday, 
July 10.  We are currently contemplating two actions.   First, we intend to 
offer to produce some documents, most notably the ISO bid data sought (which 
the Committee already has anyway).  Secondly, as we do not expect this 
voluntary partial production to placate the Committee, we are preparing an 
action to file in federal court in Sacramento on Monday challenging the 
subpoena to the extent it seeks to require the production of documents other 
than those we offered to produce.  Robin Gibbs and Mike Kirby are on board 
with this.  Please let me know if would like any additional information about 
these matters.  Thank you.

Senate Majority Leader Eager to Push Energy, Environmental Issues

WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's 
approach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle 
wants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other 
initiatives popular with Democrats. 
Daschle's aides and party strategists say the Senate's top Democrat wants to 
keep the White House on the defensive, draw attention to popular Democratic 
goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources, and 
inoculate his party against Republicans' charges that it has ignored the 
country's energy needs. Activists on both sides see potential for compromises 
that would lead to legislation Bush can sign. 

"With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you go 
with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people 
actually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics." 
Democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House. 
Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bush 
is handling energy and environmental issues. 
What's more, the House of Representatives voted to block the administration 
from drilling for oil and gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great 
Lakes. Both measures passed with support from 70 Republicans. 
"When the Republican-controlled House soundly rejects key components of the 
president's energy policy, it signals an opportunity to build a bipartisan 
consensus that begins in the center," said Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn. 
The decision to highlight energy policy came late last week after Daschle met 
privately with his chairmen of key committees. Democrats present also called 
for action on raising the minimum wage, hate-crimes legislation, a 
prescription-drug plan for seniors and other issues popular with their 
supporters. 
But concentrating on energy policy first gives Democrats an opportunity to 
seize what has been a Republican issue and turn it to their advantage, aides 
said. 
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former 
Texas oilmen. From the moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production 
to satisfy the energy needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush 
and him as beholden to special interests. 
"The White House and Republicans are in the 35 percent end of public opinion 
on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for the Republicans." 
With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat 
who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources committee, plan to have a 
comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. It will be a full- scale 
alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in May. 
The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as next week, 
when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Department. 
Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fending off 
Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling near 
Florida beaches and on national monument lands. 
The White House helped defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier 
this week by scaling back its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge 
disagreements remain over drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, a centerpiece of Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer 
an amendment to the Interior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in 
the refuge. 
Democrats also want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of 
pollutants that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines 
conservation and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements 
for sport utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel 
economy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later 
this month. 
The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle extra 
manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republicans 
such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, 
both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives. 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill 
of rights and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more 
conservation measures than the White House proposes. 
"He'll be very prominent in cobbling a centrist coalition on the issue," said 
Marshall Wittman, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute 
research center and a political adviser to McCain. "You can already see the 
outlines of that proposal -- encouragement of conservation, some exploration, 
but everything is environmentally friendly." 
The White House already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies. 
Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable 
energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He also has paid more 
attention to energy conservation, indicating support for spending on 
efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget. 
But the president is not backing away from his position that the United 
States needs to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House 
officials say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. 
The energy plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in 
the Alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to 
pay for research into alternative energy sources. 
In addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and 
energy, the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially 
accompanied his energy proposals. Rolling blackouts in California are on the 
wane, gasoline prices are falling and last week John Browne, the chief 
executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call for new oil refineries. 
That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president 
without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions. 
"It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at 
the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Like the patients' bill 
of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, energy right now "is 
low-hanging fruit," he said. 

You can send both, but I'd have folks keep it close to the vest.  Definitely 
want to make sure that none of our stuff ends up in the hands of the media.

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon 
of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the 
"core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution 
for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in 
legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) 
will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Thanks very much Mike.  The sense of urgency for getting this in "the mix" is 
not as high as it was yesterday, though we'll still need to introduce it at 
some point very soon.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

FYI   Here is the language I gave Jeff to propose for an amendment to the
Sher Bond bill  which will make sure Direct Access customers don't pay for
DWR power costs through the bonds EXCEPT for power they actually used that
was purchased by DWR.  Houston has to ok this and then Jeff has to sell it.

I also strongly recommend that the next to the last sentence of Water Code
Section 80110 be repealed in the bill.  That would leave direct access in
place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable
exit fee provisions.  Without a change like this, the bill would simply
reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the
Commission.  There is nothing else in the bill which explicitly tells the
PUC to not suspend direct access.

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail
By Daniel Taub 
Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray 
Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity 
market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a 
misdirected e-mail. 
The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was 
intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve 
Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press 
list, he said. 
Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would 
compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a 
state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and 
confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is 
buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. 
``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a 
meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail 
contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. 
According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of 
electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough 
electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged 
from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the 
e-mail is accurate. 
Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a 
megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to 
Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot 
market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher 
than on the day-ahead market. 
The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a 
quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each 
season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law 
requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed. 

gee, tough break.

Sorry, but no.

USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine 
Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the 
bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million 
for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the 
announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that 
the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under 
the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim 
which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed 
reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, 
Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy 
crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state 
with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual 
capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next 
five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's 
power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent 
more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated 
from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to 
ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these 
affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president 
James Macias said in a statement.

Folks-
Ok, here is the plan. We need to draft language on the following issues
(including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in
our Roadmap Document:

Direct Access
Large Customer Utility Service options
Rate Relief
Customer Specific Generation
Renewable Energy

These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We
need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.

I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning
the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a
work product? If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there
is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know. I would
propose meeting on Sunday at say 3:00 at Mike Kahl's office if that meets
with everyone's approval.

Thanks,
Delaney

FYI.  The call took place today at 4:00 pm EDT, but is available for replay

Campaign funds will pay for spots 
Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 7, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week 
defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political 
campaigning has become a permanent sport. 
Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an 
"information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. 
But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed 
by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. 
"The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with 
the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots 
running since June 19. 
Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the 
governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, 
including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best 
way to fight back against high energy prices." 
Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex 
Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads 
don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is 
paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using 
state money to finance his political ambitions. 
South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads 
that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually 
going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as 
ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. 
"One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is 
that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and 
some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am 
mood." 
Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan 
nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said 
the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. 
"These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public 
service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they 
may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think 
he has any credibility on this issue." 
Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, 
which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis 
standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The 
West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. 
"What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," 
said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President 
Bush in 2004. 
Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy 
companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis 
and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." 
Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had 
contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as 
Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." 
Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has 
contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the 
American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the 
ads running in California through July. 
Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential 
bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for 
the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a 
call for comment yesterday. 
Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are 
worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and 
Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. 
But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. 
Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists 
Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull 
dramatically increased. 
Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin 
running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy 
supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. 
The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed 
Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for 
Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. 
Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- 
oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as 
the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between 
supply and demand, except through strict conservation. 
"We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so 
far," Gillespie said.

Apologies folks, but upon re-reading, I caught some ambiguities and 
inaccuracies in the first draft that I sent around.  Sure that  errors 
remain, but this version should at least be somewhat closer.  Changes are in 
strike-out-underline.

 - MERGED LEG LANGUAGE.doc

Below is an update from the weekend's activities.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to 
attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the 
individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments 
provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new 
draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB 
tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain 
portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee 
to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service 
the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link 
the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought 
initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation 
stand.

Best,
Jeff

you have made me very happy.

Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to 
him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking 
like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  Hopefully 
we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  Hope it's 
not creating undue headaches.

Best,
Jeff

i'll be participating.  thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Last time I was in Houston, an IT tech deleted everything---I mean 
everything---so I need to hunt it down.  Will do so immediately and get you a 
copy.
Best,
Jeff

Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point 
presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after 
I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's 
in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.

This looks like LA Times/Wall Street Journal material......

Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time=
=20
trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP")=
=20
for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for=20
replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had=20
dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's exces=
s=20
energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to=
=20
help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is=
=20
the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO=
=20
that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything=20
wrong." =20

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk=
=20
did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had=20
requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our=

put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,=01(.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn=01,t on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that be=

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we=01,re not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We=01,re not.  No, we=01,re not, okay.  We already talked to =

day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we=

wanted you, if it=01,s possible, to continue to set that, whether it=01,s 2=

whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um=01(..

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn=01=

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that=01,s probably Powerex, isn=01,t it?

Thanks.  I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section 
that Dorothy did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that 
we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that 
document.  My proposed edits will be distributed to everyone within the next 
30-60 minutes.  Thanks to Delaney for all the work.

Best,
Jeff

P.S.  Have discussed with Dorothy and will attempt to capture in my proposed 
edits our discussion.

Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn 
By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
September 1, 2000 
Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive 
-- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do 
nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills. 
The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what 
most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers 
ultimately face the daunting task of paying them. 
No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power 
market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers. And 
while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less 
now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest -- 
beginning in 2003. 
"The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there," said 
Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking 
relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity 
customers. 
The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have 
SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or 
70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May. 
Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have; 
presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E 
customers. The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that 
level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs 
for each customer in so-called balancing accounts. 
A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state 
money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will 
almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due 
in 2003 or 2004. A third bill before the governor would speed the 
construction of power plants. 
So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it 
obligates them to pay the balance with interest later. 
The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The 
higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing 
accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts 
come due. 
Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy 
estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003. IOUs of that magnitude, 
said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a 
year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills. 
Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about 
$55; they now stand at about $130. Consumer advocates say it's likely power 
prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under 
the Davis proposal. 
"The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting 
profits," said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based 
consumer group. 
Hoge said the bills that emerged "seemed the best a corrupt system could spit 
out." She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to 
pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric 
generating companies and wholesale power markets. 
FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies 
are reasonable. TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of 
the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants. 
Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis 
bill, although he said it won't fix "the almost irreparably broken California 
energy system." 
"The problem is that California's electricity customers have been subjected 
to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market," Shames said. "It's a 
market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies." 
But Shames said the Davis bill provides at least temporary protection against 
further rate shocks, and he expects taxpayers across the state will 
ultimately assist SDG&E's customers in paying their electricity bills. 
But Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, which has called for re-regulation of the industry, opposes 
the rate-cap legislation. 
"This keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs," said Court, 
who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared 
to last year. 
Stephen Baum, chief executive officer of Sempra, said the bill puts SDG&E -- 
a Sempra subsidiary -- in the position of financing the difference between 
what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from 
customers over the next three years. 
The balancing accounts, Baum said, could grow so large that they will 
challenge Sempra's ability to borrow to cover them. 
"The problem is with the wholesale markets," said Baum, who today becomes 
chairman as well as chief executive of Sempra. "This legislation does nothing 
but postpone a big bill." 
He added that Sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be 
illegal if not later clarified by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
"If (the PUC) can't or won't, then I think the legislation is legally flawed 
and can't stand," Baum said.

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put 
mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions 
regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I 
think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as 
"an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it 
is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't 
show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, 
like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost 
recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which 
obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the 
outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever 
reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, 
the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer 
must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the 
ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm 
happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the 
document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe 
that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., 
"what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the 
language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this 
document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or 
anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, 
do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in 
hearing me out earlier).

Best,
Jeff

(Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to

result disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph

and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.)

 

     Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two

weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power

sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states

recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold

hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days.

     Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two

sides no closer to an accord.

     ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner,
FERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far

apart.''

      California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because

the companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are

also requesting money.

     A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California

during the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of

calculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks

offered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from

generators to $716 million.

      On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how

the state calculated its estimate. He wasn't convinced by

California's arguments that it should receive $8.9 billion, said

Wagner, who wouldn't provide his own estimate of how much should

be paid.

     Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and

should calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price

caps on June 18. The caps are based on the costs of the highest

priced generator during the early stages of a power shortage.

      That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct. 1,

Wagner said. He wouldn't provide an estimate of the size of such a

refund, saying it would require research into fuel prices from

that time period.

     Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the judge's

recommendation was a victory for his state. Wagner's formula would

give his state a refund of ``several billion dollars,'' and

California will sue to get the rest, he said.

     ``The judge said we're entitled to our money without

releasing any of our claims,'' Kahn told reporters.

     Generators were mixed on what Wagner's recommendations meant,

though they agreed the state asked for too much.

    ``Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with (to

justify the $8.9 billion refund), we would be owed money because

we bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in

question,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron Corp, one of

the power sellers taking part in the negotiations. ``That's shows

how ridiculous this is.''

    Houston-based Enron didn't participate in the offer to refund

$510 million, Palmer said, without being more specific.

     ``Nothing I've seen suggests that California cares about a

settlement,'' Palmer said. ``What they care about is shifting

blame. What they care about is a witch hunt.''

     Duke Energy Corp. is ``very pleased'' by the judge's

recommendations, said Brent Bailey, vice president and general

counsel of the Charlotte-based company. The judge's plan fixes

problems with California's methodology for calculating the

refunds, he said.

      California's two biggest utilities have piled up almost $14

billion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when

the state's plan to deregulate its electricity system failed. The

state began buying power on the utilities' behalf in January and

has spent close to $8 billion.

"Sacramento or Salem?"  Sort of has a nice ring to it.

No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want 
to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, 
shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes 
necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with 
either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't 
object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 
and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  
limit.

Thanks very much for the comments.

I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if 
Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition 
of Spot Market
Service which says "and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical 
corporation to
provide retail electric service" which seems to me to go way beyond even 
energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S 
twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market 
service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best 
efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara

In definition of spot market service, I would change 30 days to at least
90 days, not require the choice of there is no longer a competitive and
viable retail market, and maybe require the utility to come up with
something within that 90 day period.  I would also take out the language
that was added at the end of the first sentence and not replace it
unless we can get a clearer statement from Jeff of what he means.
Jeff-can you come up with something clearer? Barbara

Hi:  Thanks for the wires story.  I talked to Dorothy and we're square.  If 
anyone tries to make any other changes, please let me know first or have them 
call me directly, whichever you prefer.  Thanks for all your help.

The Bond Legislation
The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a 
Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the 
DWR contracts. 
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so 
Republican votes are necessary. 
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to 
go along.

The Conference Committee
Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this 
point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the 
core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill 
than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is 
uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference 
committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that 
he wants to "give it a chance."

The Core/Noncore Legislative Language
The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more 
work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing 
tomorrow morning.

Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing
The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.

Hi.  Thanks for the note.  Couple of things.  Prentice is going to do Xmas 
with us this year cuz her family will be out of town.  So we should 
absolutely include her, but I think she really wants to be included in the 
"picking" so that she gets someone's name.  If you'd like to pick the names 
and let people know, I'm completely comfortable with that.  (Confidentially, 
I have a great idea for Mike, so if, by chance, I get him as a pick, that 
would be great!)

Also, let me throw this out.  You know that if I didn't live in a 1-bedroom 
apartment, I'd host (and hopefully, we'll be having Xmas at my place in 
Mendocino a few years down the road).  Steve and Charry really carry the load 
all the time.  Have you considered opening presents and having dinner at your 
place?  I'd be happy to take care of the meal, and hang around to clean up 
afterwards.  No big deal, just a thought.  Alternatively, we could absolutely 
have it at Prentice's apartment, which is plenty big enough, and will have a 
big beautiful tree, etc.  So give that a thought.  Might be nice to do it in 
the city, and we'd be happy to host it there, too.

Now, the important stuff.  What do Katie and Michael want/need for Xmas?

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Great to see you and Prentice on T-day.  The stuffing was delicious!  And 
congratulations on giving up smoking.

It's time to pick names for gifts.  My thought is that Prentice is enough a 
part of this family that we add her name to the group.  Plan B is that we do 
what we did last year:  Mom and I just get something for her and she doesn't 
have to worry about getting something for whoever's name she "picks". Let me 
know.

It's a hell hole, whaddya think?  Be great if you stopped by.  Just let me

You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the 
Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW 
and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little 
concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great

Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the
following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in
light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of
our present Governor.

Regards,
Curt

***Who Really Powers California?***
Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling,
cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy
crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the
Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers
may
be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The
following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each
group of
generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded
up
resulting in slightly more than 100%)

18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)
15%- Southern California Edison (California)
11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)
10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)
10%- Imported power from the Southwest
7%- State and Federal Agencies
6%- AES power company
5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts
5%- Reliant power company
4%- Duke power company
4%- Southern power company
4%- Dynegy power company
1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)
1%- Calpine power company
1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)
 
It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from
Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's
energy
portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's
AES,
and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy
portfolio.

This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every
provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to
identify those power producers who used market power to ring up high
profits
on Californians, we should include ALL power producers in our
investigations.  State and federal agencies, independent power
companies,
utilities, municipal utilities, and even local irrigation districts
could
all be guilty of gouging consumers.  Davis's focusing on only those
companies from Texas does everyone in this state a disservice and is a
misrepresentation of fact.

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more 
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group 
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has 
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of 
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private 
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to 
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the 
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per 
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & 
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour 
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 
an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for 
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and 
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. 
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, 
according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased 
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more 
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest 
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have 
reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. 
"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the 
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% 
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging 
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting 
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on 
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's 
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first 
quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the 
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's 
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited 
to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the 
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. 
"All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since 
his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in 
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to 
$271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded 
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one 
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per 
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a 
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a 
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average 
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of 
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be 
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, 
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered 
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, 
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see 
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached 
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing 
the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, 
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas 
prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, 
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems 
in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state 
projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June 
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under 
$100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited 
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term 
power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry 
closer to normalcy."

Mark, Congratulations on the story in the Times.

FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic 
message that:

"Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with 
generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear 
they lost. "

Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying 
his BS at all.

Best,
Jeff

Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:

Under the definition of "Spot Market Service" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose 
service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have 
failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or 
Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If 
inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's 
appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing 
it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be 
deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison 
provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may 
turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to 
adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let 
folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in 
the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the 
green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional 
percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around 
including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted 
to briefly flag it).

Thanks again for all the effort.

Best,
Jeff

any sense of why all the pulling?

Found the final.  Don't know if it differs from the one distributed yesterday.

"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe=

the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previewing the=20
recommendations he will make to the commission.=20
But Wagner, who mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are=

Wagner also outlined a method that he said FERC should use for calculating=

refunds.=20
While his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used, it=

contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favor=

But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator, said Wagner "vindicated"=20
California's core arguments.=20
"The hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the=

=20
rejected," said Kahn, chairman of the organization that manages most of=20
California's power grid.=20
"We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be in t=

So what we have here is a situation where California will get its $8.9=20

Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome =

them. They sought an end to investigations of their conduct, and immunity=

from legal action as part of their bargaining position.=20
During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowher=

John H. Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group,=

said the state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion=20

The state's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talk=

The $8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid=

In a partial win for the state, Wagner said he would recommend that FERC us=

the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds, an approach=20

But he said that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October=

2000, and should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are=

For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas heat =

Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to October would pu=

Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North=20

FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1 Billion
From Associated Press

July 9 2001

WASHINGTON -- California is owed no more than "a billion dollars" from powe=
r=20
wholesalers, a federal regulatory judge said today at the end of 15 days of=
=20
settlement talks in the state's electricity crisis.

Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief=20
administrative law judge, said that at the same time the power suppliers=20
probably are owed more than that.

The net effect of his preliminary recommendation is that California probabl=
y=20
will receive no refunds from wholesalers.

Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in refunds. The state=
=20
has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said he will not recommen=
d=20
refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.

It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary=20
recommendation would have on efforts to settle the dispute.

Both sides said before the judge's announcement that they expected a=20
protracted legal battle in the event the talks did not produce a settlement=
.

Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Davis's representative in the talks, has said the=
=20
state would seek more than twice the claimed overcharges if the dispute mov=
ed=20
from mediated talks to a courtroom.

The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are grossly=20
inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dynegy,=20
Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that the=
y=20
have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."

John H. Stout, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company=
=20
would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall=
=20
settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal=
=20
claims.

But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains=
=20
that no refunds are justified."

FERC ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences betwe=
en=20
producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated=20
electricity market.

The state has accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly driv=
e=20
up prices. The producers have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame=
=20
jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the=
=20
workings of the free market.

The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year=

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse grou=
p=20
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who h=
as=20
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show.

During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of=
=20
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private=20
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid t=
o=20
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the=
=20
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.

Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per=
=20
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas=
 &=20
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe=
r,=20
the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour=20
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292=
=20
an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies=20
singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc.,=
=20
Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid=
=20
for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe=
r=20
megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.

The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased=
=20
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more=
=20
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencie=
s.

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest=
=20
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have=20
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.

"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.

"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the=20
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%=
=20
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are chargi=
ng=20
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting=20
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."

The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times o=
n=20
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's=20
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first=20
quarter.

The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in th=
e=20
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's=
=20
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited=
=20
to a few generators.

Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the=20
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year=
.=20
"All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs sin=
ce=20
his agency began buying power in mid-January.

The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 =
in=20
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour t=
o=20
$271, the reports show.

In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded=
=20
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, o=
ne=20
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per=20
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, =
a=20
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.

By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a=20
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average=20
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.

A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of=
=20
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not b=
e=20
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past,=
=20
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=20
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.

A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,=
=20
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to se=
e=20
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reach=
ed=20
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing=
=20
the power needed by the state were extremely high.

More Power Bought Than Projected

Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,=
=20
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas=
=20
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.

Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,=20
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.

Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply proble=
ms=20
in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of stat=
e=20
projections in June and early July.

The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June=

electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing througho=
ut=20
the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation a=
nd=20
efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential=20
information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.

Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tha=
t=20
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and=
=20
which stay secret.

"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wh=
at=20
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.

Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers

Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informati=
on=20
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."

Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last mont=
h=20
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=
at=20
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.

But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity=
=20
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20
explanation.

Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full=
=20
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.

But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,=
=20
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed dat=
a,=20
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.

"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions=
=20
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.

To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive=
=20
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke=20
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the=
=20
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.

Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke=
=20
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records t=
he=20
committee plans to turn over.

"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we ar=
e=20
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't=
=20
know what we are ultimately going to do."

The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they=
=20
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, ha=
ve=20
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,=
=20
were cited.

Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formal=

NEWS ANALYSIS
Concern Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows
Embedded costs may yield more rate hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion=
=20
total could complicate plans to rescue Edison.
DAN MORAIN
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 9 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Even as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gra=
y=20
Davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch=
=20
on a new power plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly=
=20
more daunting task of balancing the books.

It's a task with potentially far more long-lasting implications for state=
=20
coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for consumers' wallets.

In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by the governor's office=
=20
as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-control electricity=20
market are having the opposite effect politically. A growing concern about=
=20
the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of Davis' mo=
st=20
ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial rescue of Southern=20
California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate in the Legislature=
.=20
Questions about the contracts come as California readies a complex=20
$13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund for other pow=
er=20
purchases.

Critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts, on top of the billions=
=20
needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead to additional electricity=
=20
rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer advocates and business=20
lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated.

Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these critics say the sta=
te=20
should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the=
=20
prices. They argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after=
=20
California's utilities neared insolvency and the state Department of Water=
=20
Resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than 25 million=
=20
residents.

"They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen=20
(D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state struck with independent power=20
companies when prices were at record highs.

Bowen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals th=
ey=20
could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiation=
s=20
took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."

Contracts Open to Challenges

The contracts could be challenged in court or, more immediately, before the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. There, an administrativ=
e=20
law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement o=
f=20
allegations by Davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity =
by=20
$8.9 billion.

"We ought not to say, 'Fine, the contracts were the best we could do,' "=20
Bowen said.

For his part, Davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.=
9=20
billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He=
=20
attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to=20
conservation, the administration's effort to increase power supply and--a=
=20
major factor--the long-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance o=
n=20
the volatile daily, or spot, market.

"You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . . dramatically=20
shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Californians," Davis=
=20
said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30% from May to=
=20
June.

Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped negotiate the contracts,=
=20
said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, given the recent declin=
e=20
in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for California's=20
electricity-generating plants.

Freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to=
=20
douse a blaze. "After the fire is out," he said, "you complain about the=20
water damage."

The contracts have other defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics=20
professor Severin Borenstein, who says the deals helped to tame the volatil=
e=20
spot market by reducing generators' incentive to drive up prices, while=20
reducing the state's exposure to wild swings in price.

"The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great price; it's=
=20
to reduce risk," Borenstein said.

Still, experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior=20
Court judge in San Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit=
=20
by news organizations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Dav=
is=20
unseal the contracts.

An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each representing=
=20
Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group; a=
nd=20
large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-billion price tag=
=20
announced by the administration may not account for all the costs. When oth=
er=20
expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to=
=20
any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an additional 10% to=
=20
20%.

"Once the contracts were made public," Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte =
of=20
Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who can read began calling for=20
those contracts to be renegotiated."

As buyers' remorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly=
=20
are seen as a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront=
=20
fast-approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis fro=
m=20
morphing into a broader financial crisis.

A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled=20
Southern California Edison must be approved by Aug. 15. The deadline could =
be=20
tighter, because the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong=20
break July 20.

Davis' rescue plan, along with legislative alternatives, languishes in the=
=20
Legislature. The plan, which has little apparent support, would require the=
=20
state to buy Edison's system of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and=20
permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3=
.5=20
billion.

Some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approve=
d=20
in March by the California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a=20
kilowatt-hour the largest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue=
=20
generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-ter=
m=20
power contracts and repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would b=
e=20
the largest municipal deal ever.

Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the Edison rescue=
=20
remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may need to seek a=20
separate rate hike to cover its costs.

As written, the contracts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk=
=20
away from them if he concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism=
=20
persists and crosses political lines.

Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers Union, and Jack=20
Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.,=20
rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in separate=20
interviews, they sounded similar themes.

"If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts, even if we have t=
o=20
pay damages, we'd be better off in the long run," Snyder said.

Stewart, like other business leaders, does not advocate abrogating the=20
contracts. But like many familiar with the terms, he hopes that some deals=
=20
can be renegotiated.

"They are problematic," he said.

In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the=
=20
next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC to agree within a=
=20
month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the=
=20
$13.4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Stre=
et=20
investors can be assured that they will be repaid.

"The state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale=
,"=20
he said. "We will move toward fiscal insolvency."

The so-called rate agreement, a draft of which was obtained by The Times,=
=20
would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than=
=20
just the principal and interest on the $13.4 billion in bonds. Consumers=20
would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to pay taxes, fees and other=20
as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by the Department of Water=20
Resources.

Additionally, the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs b=
y=20
which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use,=
=20
although the Legislature has not approved the programs and their details=20
remain to be worked out. The Department of Water Resources estimates the co=
st=20
to be $800 million, spread over this year and next.

"It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)=
=20
said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would require the commission=
=20
to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water Resources decides=
=20
to do."

"That is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office," he said.

'Dictatorial Power' Warning

Stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it=
=20
would provide the water agency with "dictatorial power."

"As skeptical as we are of the PUC process, at least there is a process,"=
=20
Stewart said, referring to the commission's procedures to set electricity=
=20
rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR just tells the PUC, 'This is what =
we=20
need,' and the PUC must approve it."

Others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the=20
extraordinary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the=
=20
Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so=
=20
deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to=20
consumers.

In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January created=
=20
"the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdictio=
n=20
of the PUC.

"There is no public power agency in California that is reviewed by the PUC,=
"=20
said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

Washington -- An administrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to=

that it is owed $8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and=

The comments by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative l=

Judge Curtis L. Wagner, although a strong endorsement of the generators'=20
position, seemed to indicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue=
=20
before it reached the five-member regulatory commission.=20
"There are refunds due (to California) that total hundreds of millions of=

dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wagner said yesterday.=20
"At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from the California=20
Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities in the state o=
f=20
California that probably are higher than any overcharges that (the state) m=
ay=20
come up with."=20
Now, it will be up to the federal regulators to settle the case. But the=20
recommendations by Wagner, who mediated the talks, carry significant weight=
=20
with the commission and cast doubt on the state's chances of collecting the=
=20
full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=20
The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings to=
=20
calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearings=
=20
would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60=20
days, Wagner said.=20
CLOSING SESSION
Wagner made his comments in the closing session of the 15-day talks, which=
=20
were ordered last month by the regulatory commission to try to defuse the=
=20
dispute between power wholesalers and California officials before it reache=

The judge's message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by Californi=
a=20
leaders -- especially Davis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime les=
s=20
than $8.9 billion for California's consumers.=20
The governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting=
=20
that California had won its basic case that the state is owed refunds.=20
"I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodology for calculating=20
refunds and rejected the generators' position that no refunds are due," Dav=
is=20
said.=20
The governor's chief representative at the talks, Michael Kahn, called the=
=20
judge's statement a "ringing endorsement" of the state's call for refunds.=
=20
Kahn said the judge's order would improve the state's legal position if it=
=20
files suit against power sellers.=20
GENERATORS FAVORED
But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.=20
For example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8.=

e=20
regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 2000=
=20
could be considered.=20
The judge said yesterday that he would stick with the October date, meaning=
=20
that more than a third of the state's claim -- at least $3 billion -- would=
=20
not be refunded by the commission.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North=20
America, said that under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for=
=20
$1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20
"Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California has been=20
saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.=20
But Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with =

"Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billion=

=20

Wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to=20
California: $716 million in refunds.=20
The judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Bi=
g=20
Five generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6=20

California municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-stat=
e=20
power sellers.=20
California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it included =
no=20
cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the state=

Throughout the talks, generators complained that the California team was=20

"This is the third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days," Davis said,=

"They were the first to enter long-term contracts with us," the governor=20

others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in negotiations.=20
"They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us," he said.=
=20
Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of efficient new gas-=

fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to run than their=
=20
forebears, the state will be paying well above current market rates for the=

Calpine President Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is n=
ot=20
making excess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide th=

electricity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July targ=
et=20
date, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232=

In addition to the 300 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will=

The county Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities hav=

Denny Larson, spokesman for the group Communities for a Better Environment,=

"Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report can't be backed up by the=20
facts," Larson said. "Oil and chemical plants in Contra Costa have repeated=

The 52 facilities include chemical plants, oil refineries and small shops=

that produce limited amounts of hazardous materials.=20
For many of these businesses, the loss of power would shut down their=20

Power suppliers, state fail to agree on refund total=20

Mercury News Washington Bureau=20

WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree on=
=20
refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiations=
=20
ended Monday, leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said t=
he=20
state is owed much less than the $8.9 billion it demands.=20
The judge overseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
put the refunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion=20
dollars. His estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power=
=20
suppliers during negotiations. The offer was rejected by California=20
officials.=20
But it was unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would=20
prevail, and California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed =
to=20
court. At stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimate=
ly=20
have to pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system=
=20
collapsed.=20
Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will=20
recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating=
=20
back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=
s=20
such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the=20
energy suppliers had advocated during the talks.=20
Michael Kahn, who headed the California negotiating team, said the state=20
would contest some aspects of the formula. But even without changes, Kahn=
=20
said he was confident the formula will result in more refunds than Wagner=
=20
estimated.=20
``We think the numbers even using the judge's formula are going to be in th=
e=20
multiple billions,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System=20
Operator, which runs the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9=
=20
billion dollars. If we don't get all of it from the commission .?.?. we'll=
=20
still get the remainder of the money'' through the courts.=20
Amount in dispute=20
Power industry representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.=20
``We haven't gone and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere nea=
r=20
the $8.9 billion,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel=
=20
for Duke Energy North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky=
=20
number that nobody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate=
=20
number.''=20
Wagner acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula,=20
saying he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the=20
suppliers.=20
The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last month=
=20
when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=20
prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that unde=
r=20
pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the pow=
er=20
suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigation.=
=20
But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal,=20
participants said.=20
``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on one end and you s=
aw=20
$716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to splitting the=20
difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties genuinely wanted =
to=20
settle. Others didn't.''=20
Wagner now has until Monday to make his recommendation to the five-member=
=20
commission, which will make the final ruling on refunds. To date, the=20
commission has ordered $125 million in refunds for periods since last Oct. =
2.=20
Wagner said Monday that he will ask that a special hearing be set up in the=
=20
next 60 days to get the detailed information from the state and power=20
suppliers needed to determine a refund total using his formula.=20
The state may not end up with any cash, as any refund total could be applie=
d=20
to the several billion dollars California and its utilities still owe many =
of=20
the power suppliers.=20
Reflecting the tone of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Mond=
ay=20
blamed power suppliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the=20
commission to resolve the situation.=20
``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billio=
ns=20
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team=
=20
in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past the FERC has shown=
=20
little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have the opportunity to=20
redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California has demonstrated=
=20
it is owed.''=20
Davis may go to court=20
At the opening of a new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis=
=20
told reporters that he's prepared to take the power generators to court if=
=20
FERC doesn't order the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of=
=20
$8.9 billion doesn't represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates=
=20
put the figure as high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about=
=20
how those figures were calculated.=20
John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, sa=
id=20
the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.9 billion figure.=20
California officials and several suppliers said they would continue to=20
negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Calpine said his=
=20
company is close to a settlement with the state.=20
Power suppliers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energ=
y=20
commissions' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner=
=20
said he will do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed=
=20
for it. Wagner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan tha=
t=20
power suppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State=
=20
officials wanted it to cover up to May 2000.=20
$3 billion difference=20
The state's $8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001.=20
Factoring refunds beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion =
in=20
overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period.=20
Among the changes to the commission's formula that Wagner made was to revis=
e=20
the way the prevailing electricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants=
=20
the price limit determined for each hour of each day. The commission's=20
formula sets a price limit during Stage One power emergencies that remains =

effect until the next emergency.=20
But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University economi=
st=20
Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge will=20
produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.=20
``That's the methodology the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the=20

s,=20
according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a=20
legal dispute over public access to the data.=20
In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2=20

electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd=
ro=20
in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Departmen=
t=20
of Water and Power.=20
The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that hav=
e=20
arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of th=

state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in=20
California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are=

from the Northwest.=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much=
=20
of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in=20
President Bush's home state.=20
The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has=20
resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge=
=20
more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term=20
electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the fir=

quarter details.=20
Short on explanation=20
The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate=

Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major=20
utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the=20
price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for=
=20
what prompted the decrease.=20
In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market wa=
s=20
$321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May=
.=20
One megawatt powers about 750 homes.=20
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's=
=20
assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the=
=20
out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant=20
shift of money out of California.''=20
But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration=
=20
contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by=
=20
the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration=
=20
panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for=
=20
many years.=20
Used for support=20
Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks=20
against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power=20
generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down,=
=20
partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many=20
plants.=20
``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,''=
=20
said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt=
=20
the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.''=20
The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy=20
market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any=
=20
given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely=
,=20
with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and=20
companies outside Texas.=20
On one day in February, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was=20
charging $165 per megawatt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was=20

The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power,=

including the spot market and contracted power.=20
The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the state's major=

The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, owed about $1=20

And even at that, said Judge Curtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owe=
d=20
so much more in unpaid power bills that in the end California might not see=
=20
one red cent.=20
Wagner announced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission after two weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the partie=
s=20
to California's electricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now i=
n=20
the commissioners' hands.=20
Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 million in=20
refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billion=20
dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was."=
=20
For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds is =
a=20
dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased power. An=
d=20
the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of warding off=
=20
future rate increases.=20
"California will get its $8.9 billion," insisted Michael Kahn, head of the=
=20
state's delegation and the California Independent System Operator. Kahn=20
brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory in the judge's assertion tha=
t=20
the state is owed some refunds, a concept the generators have been unwillin=
g=20
to embrace up to now, he said.=20
Since the talks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week=
=20
Duke Energy offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed=
=20
their refund offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the=
=20
company were dropped.=20
But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that California i=
s=20
no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power=
=20
companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks began.=20
And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the FERC. If=
=20
unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for years.=20
"You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner said duri=
ng=20
an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommendation. H=
e=20
has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points during the=20
often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and trie=
d=20
to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unprecedented Sunday=
=20
session.=20
"The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.=20
While Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's=
=20
comments, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them "barely better=
=20
than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick." Burton agreed with Kahn that the=
=20
state has to do all it can to get more than that.=20
And Davis backed up his team.=20
"Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there wer=
e=20
overcharges made because the market was broken," Davis said. "Remarkably, t=
he=20
energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibility t=
o=20
the people of California and own up to their profiteering."=20
Power generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John=
=20
Stout, vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental=20
position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."=20
Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's=20
recommendation, "a fair one."=20
Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed=
=20
energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced=
=20
themselves from the state's refund request.=20
"I don't believe there really exists a true justification for that number,"=
=20
said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that=20
anything more than a wild number to throw out there."=20
The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because th=
ey=20
are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing=20
structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the majority of the generator=
s'=20
methods.=20
To start with, the state is asking for $8.9 billion, but about $3 billion o=
f=20
those alleged overcharges happened between May and October 2000, a period=
=20
FERC is not looking at. FERC issued two refund orders in March, finding tha=
t=20
power companies had $124 million in overcharges during power alerts. But th=
e=20
state is challenging that finding, saying there were overcharges beyond tho=
se=20
limited times. And the state is also asking FERC to reconsider allowing=20
refunds for May to October 2000.=20
How energy panel affects California=20
Six months ago, few people had heard of FERC. Now the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission, the agency charged with making sure that the nation'=
s=20
power markets are running smoothly and that wholesale prices are "just and=
=20
reasonable," rolls off the tongue.=20
The five commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their=
=20
home state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks th=
at=20
concluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's=
=20
electricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term=
=20
power contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months.=
=20
FERC's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.=20
WHAT WAS AT STAKE?=20
For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amount power=
=20
companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's finding? There=
=20
should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.=20
For the generators: More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for=20
unpaid power bills. Wagner's finding? Generators are owed more money than t=
he=20
refunds they owe California. He did not specify by how much.=20
For California consumers: A stable electricity market. Until the refund iss=
ue=20
is settled and power prices are stabilized long term, what the future holds=
=20
for rate increase remains uncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement.=20
Consumers still in limbo.=20
HOW DID WE GET HERE?=20
In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The state began=20
appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the utilities we=
re=20
running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the electricity they=
=20
sold. Rolling blackouts began.=20
Starting in January, the state began buying the power, replacing the=20
near-bankrupt utilities. Politicians from Sacramento to Washington increase=
d=20
the pressure on FERC to cap rates. More than $27 billion was spent to buy=
=20
power for California last year, compared with $7 billion the year before. T=
he=20
price tag could reach $50 billion this year.=20
On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps experts say could=20
moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but the caps hav=
e=20
caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some power off the=
=20
market.=20
WHAT'S NEXT?=20
The FERC commissioners will receive Wagner's report within a week. In it, h=
e=20
will suggest they hold a fast-track formal hearing that would last no more=
=20
than 60 days.=20
If they agree, after that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and=

other California market issues.=20
If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagree, they can=

contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could last many=20
years.

The utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy=

The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The=20
second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.=
=20
But since May, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate=20
weather, lower natural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered dema=
nd=20
and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into=20
possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts=
=20
also drove the price down.=20
"It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, but it=20
looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis,=20
spokesman for Assembly Republicans.=20
The slight reduction in spot-market prices "underscores questions about the=

Most of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20=

That's why I'm gnawed by this "d,j. vu" sensation. The similarities and=20
parallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are=20

the county's leadership, he ignored it. The rest is history. In a=20
half-pregnant deregulation scheme, the state capped the retail price that t=

electricity through the use of long-term contracts.=20

It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of retail rate=

WASHINGTON, July 9 -- A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiations=20
about California 's demands for electricity refunds today, with the state a=
nd=20
power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the talks=20
began.=20
The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong=
=20
dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which the mediator=
=20
may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of about $1 billion=
.=20
California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it would seek that=
=20
much and more, through the courts if necessary.=20
Although electricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the pow=
er=20
crisis that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikel=
y=20
to be resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity shoul=
d=20
have cost during the last 13 months.=20
The power market has been mired in an accounting gridlock. The state claims=
=20
that generating companies began grossly overcharging for electricity -- wit=
h=20
prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 20 over year-before levels -- beginning=
=20
in late spring last year. Generators say they are prepared to pay some=20
refunds, but argue that California 's estimates of overcharges are radicall=
y=20
inflated.=20
The mediator in the settlement talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an=20
administrative law judge for the federal agency, who said today that the=20
negotiations had failed to reach the comprehensive voluntary settlement he=
=20
had sought.=20
Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the agency's commissioners that they=
=20
convene a 60-day evidentiary hearing that would impose an administrative=20
solution. He also said he would suggest a method for determining fair price=
s=20
for electricity .=20
Under federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''jus=
t=20
and reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last yea=
r=20
that California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently beg=
an=20
imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations of=
=20
past overcharges systematically.=20
While the scope of any refunds remains uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks=20
appeared more favorable for generators than for Western states, which have=
=20
collectively pressed for as much as $15 billion in refunds.=20
Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California should have paid for=
=20
power since last September, when the commission began monitoring California=
=20
energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroactively apply a price=
=20
control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated that he supported a w=
ay=20
of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method=
=20
favored by power companies than to the one put forward by California=20
officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recommending could=20
require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''maybe a billion''=
=20
dollars.=20
California officials gave a positive cast to the judge's statements, callin=
g=20
them a step forward because he formally acknowledged that companies would=
=20
have to pay some refunds. They also noted that whatever the level of=20
federally mandated refunds, they would have the option of seeking more in=
=20
court.=20
''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' said Michael Kahn, who=20
represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talks. ''If we don't get i=
t=20
all from the commission, we will get the remainder in the courts.''=20
Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did not provide refund=
s=20
in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue generators for $18=
=20
billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generators, mostly out of=20
state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said, speaking at the=
=20
ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California .=20
Representatives of several generating companies said that during the=20
settlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500=
=20
million. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge=
=20
would result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their=
=20
offer than to California 's demand.=20
Still, several executives said they now hoped to reach individual settlemen=
ts=20
with the state that would end the threat of prolonged litigation and allow=
=20
them to collect several billion dollars they say they are owed by the state=
=20
and its leading, financially pressed utilities, which ran up huge debts to=
=20
suppliers in the last year.=20
''We remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state=

The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considerable weight with FERC=

Jeff-
I think their predictions are correct about members getting active -- though
next week is mostly ceremonious I do expect there to be many bills
introduced on the subject. I agree that the agenda looks ambitious but our
hope is directly in line with yours -- the material is background for what I
hope is lively and productive discussion. Glad you can make it. See you
there!

Delaney

Thanks, Delaney.  See you on Friday.

Quick comment:  Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks
seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon
as they arrive in Sacramento (next week?).  Seems that a key--if not
dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come
to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the
Legislature and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.  Sure you
folks are very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks
pretty ambitious for a 3-hour meeting.  In any case, just a thought that I
wanted to share.

Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.

Best,
Jeff

Let's go ahead and do a call.  Good time for the 3 of us to catch up on what 
we've been up to (unless Alan and Sue are strongly opposed).  But no need to 
set up a formal agenda.

State discloses spot power  buys

By Andrew  LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER  

SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay 
Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by 
Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  

All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 
69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, 
according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  

The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  
megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  
agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  

Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the 
California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  
of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  

Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion 
of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller 
was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  

The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than 
$100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight 
supplies  boosted spot market prices.  

In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  
significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy 
in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have 
to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up 
purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

and don't even remember which of my (many) soliloquoys you may have

=09=09
Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=
y=20
advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20
issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but=
=20
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=
,=20
a big part of the problem is a "dysfunctional market" -- a thinly veiled=20
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20
customers and generators) must "behave responsibly".
Everyone must "share the pain".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20
returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=
ve=20
proposals in the next couple of weeks.
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=
=20
attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was=
=20
fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=
=20
new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments=
=20
about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=
on=20
siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The=20
staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=
t=20
remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=
nd=20
remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=
te=20
(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =
is=20
a "share the pain" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=
e=20
deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=
rm=20
of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=
=20
agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=
=20
administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the=
=20
problem. =20

I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as=
=20
always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should=20
prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)=
=20
that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar=
d=20
(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps=
=20
them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already=20
articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20
around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the=
=20
political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.  Jeff will foll=
ow=20
up with one of the staff members in particular (Kari Dohn) and I would=20
suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary politica=
l=20
rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed.

o Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a stat=

o Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand=

o Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority;
o Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices;
o Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices.

darling boy-

i'm never mad at you, never ever, and i really do adore you to death and
forever and can't bear the idea that we wouldn't be friends till death do
us
part, and that i wouldn't be welcome in your life, so no, i was never mad
and don't even remember which of my (many) soliloquoys you may have
interrupted or are referring to but i do know that i have a rather
boisterous personality and perhaps i stepped on your toes and this is not
my
intention and i adore you and my company is about to go under so the idea
of
being unemployed AND having you upset with me is far too much for my
delicate self to handle...

xo
colleen

i was never mad at you.  i thought that you were mad at me for interrupting
your soliloquy.

You're fired.

FYI. In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.  Granted, 
we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with 
Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be 
helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review 
the Hogan piece.  

Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn 
"analysis"  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be 
very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power 
included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't 
nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to 
exploring it.

Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals 
folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to 
include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull 
Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.  Ultimately, may be preferable to 
have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather 
than directly from us.

Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California?
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isn't going far enough in its 
attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market, according to a 
paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric. The 
paper by John D. Chandley, Scott M. Harvey, and William W. Hogan argues that 
FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California 
Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator, rather than 
worrying about the governance of the two institutions.
"The change in governance may help," says the paper - "Electricity Market 
Reform in California" - "but it is not likely to be decisive in the near 
term. Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and 
trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be 
accomplished within an acceptable time frame." Hogan, of the Kennedy School 
of Government, has been writing since 1995 in opposition to California's 
market separation.
Also, argues the paper, freeing the California utilities to engage in forward 
contracting is no panacea. "The expectation that merely allowing utilities to 
participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high 
prices is problematic and not supported by the commission's staff report," 
says the analysis, adding that "putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts 
in the present environment may make things worse." If the underlying problem 
in California is high cost and low capacity, requiring forward contracting 
could harm not only California but also the entire Western U.S. electric 
system.
FERC's $150 so-called "soft cap" is a wild card that has the three economists 
scratching their heads. "It does not appear in the staff report and there is 
little critical analysis of their implications, other than the discussion of 
Commissioner [Curt] Hebert." If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward 
cost justification for bids above $150/MWh, then FERC is headed into an 
administrative morass "that would rival those under wellhead price controls 
in the natural gas industry."
If, on the other hand, the soft cap is "truly soft" and would only require 
some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is 
eventually deemed not just and reasonable, "there might be little impact on 
consumer prices (particularly if the principal sources of those high prices 
are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of 
market power). Even so, the proposal might serve to deter entry and new 
investments, thus combining the worst of both worlds, high consumer prices 
and little or no new investment."
FERC's proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just 
what constitutes market power. The paper cites the proposed order's lawyerly, 
obfuscatory conclusion that "while this record does not support findings of 
specific exercises of market power, and while we are not able to reach 
definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers, there is clear 
evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the 
opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can 
result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the [Federal Power Act]." The 
economists note, "In this regard, the debate is confused because we are 
dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face."
In the case of California, say the economists, there is no evidence of market 
power. Even the practice of generators avoiding the day-ahead market in favor 
of the real-time market "is a response to bad market design and pricing 
incentives (including price caps), but does not demonstrate the exercise of 
market power." Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of 
market power, they add. "The distinction between direct marginal cost and 
opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion. Hence, a competitive 
bidder whose direct cost of generation is $40 but who could sell the same 
energy outside California for $100 should bid no less than $100. This would 
not be an exercise of market power."

FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that 
this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the 
specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to 
get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., 
Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the 
Legislature as soon as possible.

In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate 
agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue 
requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison 
and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's 
going to get very interesting from here.

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones

   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell

  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Greetings;

I've tried to accommodate everyone's comments, but there's still a hole or 
two.   In addition, seems that the letter would benefit from a bit more 
editing to make it shorter.  Richard, note that I've left a place holder in

At this point, yes, that's sort of how I feel about it.  Unless someone can 
come up with some damned good reasons to do otherwise.

Folks:  Please see highlighted sections.  Anyone seen Byron's plan?  Know

SACRAMENTO -- Six months after jumping into the electricity business, the 
Davis administration on Monday provided the first detailed glimpse of 
California's daily power purchases, showing more than $5 billion in payments, 
much of it to government-owned utilities and private companies that state 
officials have branded as price gougers. 
The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts and 
other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets, 
according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a 
legal dispute over public access to the data. 
In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 
billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for 
electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro 
in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power. 
The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have 
arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the 
state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in 
California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are 
from the Northwest. 
Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much 
of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in 
President Bush's home state. 
The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has 
resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge 
more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term 
electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the first 
quarter details. 
Short on explanation 
The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Water 
Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major 
utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the 
price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for 
what prompted the decrease. 
In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market was 
$321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May. 
One megawatt powers about 750 homes. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's 
assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the 
out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant 
shift of money out of California.'' 
But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration 
contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by 
the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration 
panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for 
many years. 
Used for support 
Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks 
against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power 
generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down, 
partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many 
plants. 
``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' 
said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt 
the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.'' 
The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy 
market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any 
given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely, 
with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and 
companies outside Texas. 
On one day in February, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was 
charging $165 per megawatt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was 
charging nearly $500 and Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging 
up to $575. 
The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, 
including the spot market and contracted power. 
The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the state's major 
utilities, which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing 
enormous debts for electricity. 
San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants 
around California including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth 
of business with the state in the first five months of the year, according to 
the figures. 
The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financially. PG&E later 
went into bankruptcy. 
On Monday, state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a 
plan to rescue financially ailing Edison. 
While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison will not 
win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have created several 
working groups to come up with alternatives. 
Compromise plan 
On Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest 
compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small 
businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help 
finance the Edison bailout. 
The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, owed about $1 
billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive about $300 
million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 billion -- 
about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay off the 
remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for power. 
In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on 
the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy 
deals. 
Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday afternoon, but it 
remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the 
Legislature.

Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality continues

(Published July 11, 2001) 
California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit: 
The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it 
can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of 
dollars to cover the debt. 
There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's heat 
truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners 
demand more juice than California can generate or buy. 
One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy 
protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of 
joining it. 
There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin, 
media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becoming 
dominant, while the real situation fades into the background. 
This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality 
and everything to do with the virtual version. 
Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from the 
generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past 
year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, "being gouged and ripped 
off." But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an 
arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intended 
for a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealistic, 
Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity. 
"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a 
billion dollars," Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But 
that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. "If you 
think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see 
you in court," Davis said Tuesday. 
Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since he 
began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off 
California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for 
substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple 
of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be 
embarrassed. Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as 
fighting for California and against the out-of-state generators. 
That it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another event 
this week, Davis' release of state power purchase data from early in the year 
-- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do 
it. 
Davis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power 
brokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on 
Californians' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texan 
George W. Bush is a co-conspirator. But the power purchase records -- which 
were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate that 
less than 10 percent of California's power purchase dollars were going to 
Texas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such 
publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that 
undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from 
continuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic 
virtual world. 
One cannot, however, ignore reality forever. The likelihood of a 
pro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for 
Davis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from 
slipping into bankruptcy court. The Legislature has refused to act on the 
Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's 
debts would be slimmed down by FERC. 
This week's farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will 
stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the 
utility into bankruptcy court later this summer. That's part of that nasty 
old reality that cannot simply be wished away.

...then you click "audio" and it should load!

You bet.  Got your and Fran's messages.  If you'd like to discuss by phone, 
I'm in all day.  Otherwise, I suggest that we do take the following next 
steps:  

Just as soon as you have the proposal and list of participants drafted (which 
I hope will be very soon), please forward to me.  
Then, as quickly as possible, I'd like to have a meeting to discuss and 
finalize the proposal.  It would be very useful if Laura Tyson could be in on 
that final meeting, and, of course, any other of the participants that you'd 
like to invite.

We're are somewhat behind the eight ball due to the delays thus far in 
getting this thing off the ground.  If we're going to do it, it's going to 
have to come together quickly, and the report will have to be developed very 
quickly, too.  Hope that will be possible.

I'm assuming at this point that you and I are proceeding ahead absent Mitch 
and Carl, since they have sensitive issues with their clients that we can't 
seem to overcome?

And I'll inquire about the need for expert witnesses in the class action 
suit  and get back to you.

Best,
Jeff

We agreed to this petition to terminate the audit once the year 2000 was
complete so that we could use that for our negative PX Credit claim proof.
Following Jan 19th of 2001 this schedule is dead anyway. Needing the audit
results of 1999 and 1998 was useless. We will be lucky to gain our money
from 2000 there is absolutely no hope of getting anything from those years
if there was an error. In addition our own analysis didn't show any areas we
were worried about in those years after our 2 run in and subsequent UDC
corrections in 98 and 99. The initial UDC position was to simply stop paying
for the audits just as they did with the PX Credits with virtually no
discussion with the CPUC.

Why did you two support eliminating the audit of the PX Credit?

et al. - Joint  
                                               Petition of SCE, PG&E, and
SDG&E             
 

Attached for your information is a joint petition for modification of the
1998 Revenue Adjustment Proceeding ("RAP") decision filed today by SCE,
PG&E
and SDG&E.  The utilities request that, on an expedited basis, the
Commission limit the scope of the PX Credit audit which WPTF obtained in a
negotiated settlement in the 1998 RAP proceeding to remaining year 2000
calculations and thereafter order that the audit be terminated.  They state
that the audit is both irrelevant and costly and that "common sense
demands"
the Commission reconsider the decision.

They ask that comments in opposition be filed by August 3, reply comments
on
August 10 and a Commission decision at its meeting scheduled for August 23.
They also ask the Commission to waive the period provided in Rule 77.7 for
comments and reply comments on a draft decision in order that the decision
become final immediately.

The filing states that there have been dramatic changes in energy markets,
the number of DA customers has declined significantly and that ratepayers
should not have to pay for the audit.  Of course, they don't mention that
the reason for the decline in DA customers is their own failure to pay the
PX Credit.  It is instead attributed to the "dysfunctional restructuring
scheme and concommitant rise in wholesale energy prices."  They justify
their request legally by stating that their filing demonstrates that there
are "significant new facts" and a "material change in conditions."  The
third criteria for reopening or modifying a Commission decision, a basic
misconception of law or fact by the Commission, is not alleged to have
occurred.

They also state that DA penetration will continue to decline because
"Assembly Bills X1-1 and X1-6 have effectively reregulated the market."

Attached to the filing are declarations from the three ESP members of the
Audit Committee, Bob Anderson of APSES,  Aaron Thomas of AES NewEnergy and
Marilynn Semro of Seattle City Light Department, in support of the
utilities' petition.  I have not reviewed the specific wording changes to
the RAP decision to determine if there are any problems with the proposed
modifications.

It's worth going to this site just to "flip the switch" and see the redacted 
portions appear before your very eyes!

Ken Smith just called my attention to the following.  See this link for all 
formerly censored language from the DWR contracts:

http://www.sco.ca.gov/power_page/contract_info.htm

Also, see the summary link.

Finally, below is an interesting article about the real cost of the contracts.

      Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure  July 6, 2001  By JOHN HOWARD 
The Orange County Register  SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity 
purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than 
double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state 
Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday.  Connell said her staff's analysis 
put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by 
Davis.  Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive 
another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount 
likely would require some future increase.  The controller, who writes the 
state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the 
duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years.  The 
administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time.  Consumer groups were skeptical of the 
administration's numbers.  "You could cut these numbers in various ways and 
make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or 
nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically," said 
Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's 
$69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex."   

no.  you're fired, but you have to stay.

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
"mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Alan Comnes

FYI.  You may have read that Calpine is close to reaching a deal with the 
state on its overcharges (about $240MM).  Note from structuring's analysis 
that Alan sent around that Calpines share of the stranded costs is about 45% 
of the total amount of stranded costs arising from the DWR contracts.  That 
is, of the $9.5B (present value) of stranded costs, the Calpine contracts 
account for about $4.4B  So, in exchange for settling on $240MM, Calpine gets 
$4.4 B.  Nice work if you can get it.

force the  other to produce the milk of four cows, then

California: You have two cows. The state tells you how
to milk  your cows, when to milk your cows, how much to
milk your cows and the most  that you can charge for the
milk. You go broke and sell the cows. The state  calls you
greedy and blames you for the current milk shortage.  

Thanks.Glad to hear it.

Sue and I discussed, and if it ain't too much trouble, I think the search 
should go from 1996-1998 and should include any letters to FERC from any

Please note Maviglio's comments in response to Sec of State Bill Jones' claim 
that Davis' consultants have violated ethics laws by not filing conflict of 
interest reports with the state while working for Davis.  Maviglio sez:

Jones is "on a witch hunt on something outside his jurisdiction."

State energy contracts must be paid off by users in system

By Ed Mendel  
 SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 

July 12, 2001 

SACRAMENTO -- California businesses are being hit by big electricity rate
increases, some as high as 100 percent, and they would like to be able to
shop around for cheaper power. 

But state regulators are poised to ban customer choice, or "direct access"
as it has come to be called, because they want to make sure that enough
customers remain with utilities to pay for state power purchases. 

After a month of closed-door talks, the revelation that the state has signed
$43 billion worth of long-term power contracts at above-market prices helped
scuttle an attempt to work out a compromise in the Assembly.

  <http://www.signonsandiego.com/images/trans_1x1.gif>    

"If the intent of the big customers is to leave the small customers paying
for those contracts, we are going to fight like hell," said Lenny Goldberg,
a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network. 

Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology
Association, said large business users were offering to pay off the back
debt of Southern California Edison, estimated at $3.5 billion, in exchange
for direct access. 

"I thought we were making a lot of progress until the information on the
contracts came out," Stewart said. "We really don't have a way of dealing
with those contracts." 

Now Stewart is suggesting that direct access be slowly phased in over a
period of years and that the long-term power contracts be renegotiated,
perhaps with some being switched from the state to big-business users. 

The manufacturers association and the California Chamber of Commerce helped
organize a business coalition, Californians for Energy Action, that wants a
cheaper alternative to power purchased for utility customers by the state. 

"Many large and small California businesses have seen their electric bills
double," says a newspaper ad being run by the coalition this week. "These
cost increases are a burden that will cause consumer prices to increase,
some businesses to fail and jobs to be lost." 

A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission for PG&E
and Edison customers in May fell heaviest on business users. The PUC said
that the average residential increase was about 50 percent, while the
average business increase was about 75 percent. 

Legislation that authorized the state to begin buying power in January for
the utilities, who were crippled by a failed deregulation plan, bars rate
increases for residential customers who use up to 130 percent of the
baseline, the minimal amount deemed necessary for a household. 

Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, and other
legislators have argued that large businesses should bear most of the burden
of the failed deregulation plan because it was business, not residential
consumers, who pushed for deregulation. 

Alan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said that
forcing businesses to bear a "disproportionate" rate increase will cost
everyone through higher prices for goods and services and possibly a loss of
jobs. 

"If government didn't allow implementation of deregulation in the right
manner," Zaremberg said, "then we all have to find a solution. We are all in
this together, and that's residential and business alike." 

The legislation that authorized the state to buy power also directed the PUC
to ban direct access power purchases, if the loss of rate revenue from the
departing customers would harm the ability to pay off a power bond. 

The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in September or
October to repay the taxpayer-supported state general fund for power
purchases. The bond would be paid off by ratepayers over 15 years. 

Last week, the Senate rejected a bill by Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey,
on a 19-12 vote that would have allowed businesses to shop for power if they
paid an "exit fee" to protect the bond payments. Business groups said the
fee was too large and would not result in lower power costs. 

"I cannot carry a direct-access bill that makes it harder to sell the bonds
or that shifts costs from large users, who leave for cheaper power, to
smaller users and residential ratepayers," Bowen said. 

Burton and Bowen have both criticized Gov. Gray Davis' plan to keep Southern
California Edison from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in bankruptcy. They
say the plan, which includes the state purchase of the Edison transmission
system, is too generous to Edison. 

Both Burton and Bowen have suggested that an Edison bankruptcy may not be a
calamity. But in the Assembly, Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys,
launched a drive for an alternative Edison rescue plan that was based on
gaining business support by offering direct access. 

Hertzberg asked a former Democratic assemblyman, Phil Isenberg of
Sacramento, to try to work out an agreement among the various special
interest groups: business, labor, consumers and generators. 

The basic plan considered by the Isenberg group would have left "core"
customers -- residences and small businesses -- in a regulated system
receiving power at stable prices from the generators and contracts retained
by the utilities. 

Businesses and other large users, the "non-core" customers, would be free to
shop around for low-cost power by 2003 if they agreed to help pay off the
Edison debt. 

The Edison rate increase for large users would be limited to 50 percent. The
PUC would create a "balancing account" to track costs, issuing a refund if
too much was collected or raising rates if revenue fell short. 

Business and generator groups told Hertzberg last week that they reached
agreement on a general framework, with the exception of the state purchase
of the Edison transmission system and some other issues. But the consumer
and labor representatives opposed the framework. 

Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network said in a dissenting statement
that an across-the-board allocation of state power costs would be "clearly
unfair" and cause residential users to subsidize direct-access customers. 

Hertzberg said he is considering some of the ideas in the framework
presented by the Isenberg group and may make a proposal in a week or two. 

"We are looking at all the possibilities," Hertzberg said. "We are trying to
do some form of direct access within the current contract structure." 

Attached is the revised document.  I faxed the signature pages and service 
list.  I also faxed the entire document.  We will mail the document to the

Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he 
sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key 
points:
Based on an expectation that the "expedited siting" bill would help site 
plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.

The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm 
requirement.
The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 
2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting 
down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two 
LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).
In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO 
(which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of 
going to the market, thus killing the economics.
On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that "...it 
be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has 
contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and 
maintain the plant," 
it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is 
(i.e, before the project has been approved), and,
it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal 
resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks 
prefer).

In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while 
the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.  Point 2 in 
bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.

If any questions, let me know.  Bruno has emailed the price cap and the 
"general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap" bills, and faxed the siting bill.

Best,
Jeff

Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small 
customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal 
that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the 
MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not 
yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting 
attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is 
attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on 
the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by 
customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the 
generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, 
investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts 
and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the 
bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong 
possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX 
labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to 
include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate 
has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds 
to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. 
AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."  
Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" 
MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow 
(Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, 
with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on 
Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, 
July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get 
resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional 
comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie 
Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in 
Sacramento.

Calif DWR Seen Asking PUC To Order 25% Rate Increase Fri
By Jason Leopold

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
(This article was originally published earlier Friday.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the
agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three
investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that
they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.

This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream
to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public
Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.

PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday
either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's
current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office
said.

If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate
structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the
rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power
buying business.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners
said.
"Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be
forced to do it again by the summer," one commissioner said.

"It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone. The state has
made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever
it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds."

Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late
Thursday.

Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has
drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or
Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to
finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts,
aides in his office said.
Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use
the least amount of power. Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides
said.

Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State

The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion
annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to
generate $2.5 billion. However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the
commissioners said.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners
said.
Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity
on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern
California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.

The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which
must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.

In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term
power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure
there is enough power to meet demand. Future rate increases to finance the
contracts are likely, state officials have said.

But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the
utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.
Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions
that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion
in revenue bonds to be sold.

The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state
Treasurer Phil Angelides.

The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate
hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to
terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since
last year.

After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of
California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down
Monday. Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov. Gray
Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.

Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which
could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve
Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.

An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds
to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the
generators than what he thinks the state is owed.

California Power-Price Boost Not Needed, Agency Says (Update1)
By Daniel Taub

Sacramento, California, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California regulators won't 
need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned $13.4 
billion bond sale, said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf 
of the state's utilities. 

The California Department of Water Resources, which has spent more than $7.7 
billion on power this year, is expected to recommend a rate increase of as 
much as 25 percent, Dow Jones reported today, citing three unnamed members of 
the state's Public Utilities Commission. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the 
agency, said no rate increase is expected. 

``Our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what 
our numbers show,'' Hidalgo said. ``In fact our numbers show that there is no 
need for any increase beyond what's already been done.'' 

The Department of Water Resources will submit a report to the California 
Public Utilities Commission today or Monday with the state's revenue 
requirements for repaying a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, Hidalgo said. 
The bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by PG&E Corp., 
Edison International and Sempra Energy. 

The bond sales, the largest municipal offering in U.S. history, are scheduled 
to begin in September. Governor Gray Davis has said repeatedly that he 
believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases. His position 
hasn't changed, spokesman Steve Maviglio said today. 

Previous Increases 

In March, the PUC voted to boost rates by 3 cents a kilowatt- hour at the 
state's two largest utilities. Rates at PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the 
largest California utility, would rise by as much as 36 percent and Southern 
California Edison rates would rise by as much as 27 percent, the PUC said at 
the time. 

The average consumer-price increase would be 30 percent, the PUC said. The 
increase, the second this year, was intended to help the state pay for power 
purchases. The PUC voted in January to raise rates about 10 percent. 

California Treasurer Philip Angelides has said that the bonds will let the 
state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by 
spreading power costs over time. The debt will be repaid over 15 years. 

Investors have said they can't predict how the bonds will be received without 
knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt. 

Legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise 
electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment. That pledge, typical for 
revenue bonds, usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money 
annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an 
added cushion. 

That formula, known as a debt service coverage ratio, must result in 
investment-grade ratings for California's power bonds, according to the 
legislation. Investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to 
maintain the promised cushion, even if increases aren't needed at the time of 
the bond sale. 

Barry, et al:

authority to engage in financial risk management tools.  More info to follow

resolution or decision for Sempra.  Haven't found it yet, but we believe
they have been given similar authority.  

Here's the latest that we have on the legislation ("82XX") released on Friday.
The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an "informational" hearing on 82XX at 
1:30 PM PDT today.
"Informational" means that there won't be a vote today.
Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman 
Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an "author"  of 82XX), 
Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant.
The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution.
Dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with 
the "more recent version" of the bill, and was unhappy that there would be a 
hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other 
authors had agreed to final language from their perspective.
Dutra said that he was working to remove the Direct Access suspension and 
asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out 
tomorrow.
PUC President Lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the 
Commission gives up all review of DWR's "revenue requirement" and simply 
flows all DWR costs through rates (but Davis and his administration are 
putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree).
As a result, details of any "rate agreement" between DWR and the CPUC, and 
any public announcement by DWR of its "revenue requirement" is could be 
postponed until next week, unless there's a breakthrough with Loretta.
The Governor's consultants now claim (and will reportedly testify at the 
hearing today) that there is enough room in the 3 cent rate increase to cover 
both Edison's and DWR's revenue requirements.  (They cite lower gas prices 
and FERC's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom, 
though many remain very skeptical.)
However, if the deal is applied to PG&E, it is unlikely that the 3 cent rate 
would be sufficient, according to the same consultants.
The plan (at this point) is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in 
the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.  The bill would 
then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday.
It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly 
Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday.
In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version  of an 
Edison "MOU," and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the 
Senate side appears strained.
The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are 
generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no 
Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills.
Meanwhile, Edison continues to twist.

Will report back after the 1:30 hearing today.

If anyone has questions, don't hesitate to contact me by pager @ 888.916.7184.

Drew/Steve/Tony:

I've talked to Dan and he's available to represent Steve during his testimony 
on Wednesday.  Few things:

Dan's an excellent regulatory lawyer.
Dan worked for many years at SoCalGas before going into private practice.
Drew, I'll leave to you and Dan to work out the details of any contract for 
Dan's services.
Dan will need immediately:
A copy of Steve's testimony.
A copy of the PUC Rulemaking, etc. calling for testimony.
Any information on the list of parties who have indicated that they will 
cross Steve and for how long, and any testimony filed by those parties.
In addition, I would recommend strongly that Dan and Steve (at a minimum) get 
on the phone and discuss Steve's testimony tomorrow, and plan to meet prior 
to the hearing on Wednesday.  If you'd like me to participate in a call 
tomorrow, just let me know.

If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.

PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to 
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June 
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our 
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying 
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group 
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want 
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.

Jeff,

Diann Huddleson has spoken with PG&E on numerous occasions, and they have 
confirmed that effective as of January 19, 2001, they began using a Weighted 
Average cost of Generation/Purchase for the calculation of the PX amount.  I 
will coordinate between Tamara and the Services group which has this 
information and make sure everyone is on the same page.  I also support 
Tamara's desire to reconcile, at a tariff level, the curves to actual utility 
bills. 

Thanks,
Wanda

Jim, I think that the point of the "flurry" is that we in California ain't 
received anything from PG&E.  Seemed that Wanda, from her note, said that she 
is on top of it.  Can you check in with Tamara and find out what her issues

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

ed_sen.pdf

FYI.  This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall 
that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and 
Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).  

Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been 
scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would "impair" the 
contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western 
Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.

As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 
2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.  We urging Brulte 
to go along, but only  in exchange for deleting the "no DA" language in AB1X 
and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.

Attached, please find SB 18 (Burton) relating to bonds.  This is a regular
session bill with an urgency clause which means it requires a 2/3 vote.  The
bill language was formerly associated with ABX2 10 (Hertzberg).  The bill
could be heard by the Senate Energy Committee as early as today however as
of this moment it is still not on calendar.

ed_sen.pdf

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.  Few 
questions.

Mike, 
I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on 
behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any 
discussions on this bill?
What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably, their 
in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)?
What about large customers?  They been screaming for more infrastructure, 
too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it.
Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or 
opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric 
mayhem.
There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates 
from building into the state.
If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing 
its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) 
capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing 
pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want 
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more 
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually 
does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

   in any discussions on this bill?
   What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,
   their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the
   bill)?
   What about large customers?  They been screaming for more
   infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not
   delivering it.
   Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or
   opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the
   electric mayhem.
   There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the
   interstates from building into the state.
   If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when
   doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and
   noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,
   interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill
actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

Alert           
 

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create
a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the
way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible
service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas
sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it
more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.

Hurt by Deregulation of Utilities,
California Gives Itself Lead Role
By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN R. EMSHWILLER 
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- In a video made for a political roast, Gov. Gray
Davis, mimicking the Mafia boss in "The Sopranos," complains to his
therapist about Texas bad guys pushing electricity prices sky high. He vows
to get tough. Soon, a Davis confederate ushers four men in 10-gallon hats
into an office, shots ring out, and the aide, emerging blood-spattered,
delivers the punch-line: "Tell the governor his Reliant problem is solved."

While Gov. Davis hasn't gone that far in his fight with suppliers such as
Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., he is in other ways trying to blast his
way out of the crisis. His moves are coming in rapid succession after months
of criticism of the governor for inaction, and they are fast reshaping the
state's electricity system.

 
With the acquiescence of other state leaders, Gov. Davis has put California
on the road to creating what amounts to a mammoth state-owned electric
utility, answerable largely to the governor. Moreover, though designed to
solve a short-term emergency, the governor's policies are loading consumers
with obligations that could affect the economy of the most-populous state
for 15 to 20 years.

His actions in some ways hark back to the system of central control that
preceded the disastrous 1996 foray into utility deregulation. But they
aren't simply a return to the days of monopoly utilities strictly regulated
by the state's Public Utilities Commission. What is emerging now is a
California power colossus that operates in important ways beyond the reach
of regulators or the public.

Mr. Davis says his actions will ensure that Californians have a secure
supply of reasonably priced electricity. "This is not a power grab," the
Democratic governor says in an interview. "I had no desire to intervene. I
would get out tomorrow if you would let me out. This is my least-favorite
thing to do."

'Colossal Failure'

Yet in the past six months, pushed by what he calls the "colossal failure"
of a deregulation plan hatched under his Republican predecessor, the
governor has put the state deep into the power business. In January, Mr.
Davis ordered the state Department of Water Resources to begin buying power
in place of California's cash-strapped utilities. Since then, the state has
purchased or committed to purchase $45 billion to $50 billion of
electricity, with some contracts as long as 20 years.

 
The governor has in effect seized control of the state's electricity-grid
operator, the California Independent System Operator, installing his
hand-picked team as board members. As its name implies, the ISO was supposed
to manage the grid without favoring any one participant.

Mr. Davis also is pushing to have the state buy huge chunks of the
transmission system that are owned by the financially beleaguered utilities.
He recently signed into law a bill that creates a state power authority,
whose director will be appointed by the governor. This agency, which so far
exists just on paper, could be used to build power plants and help run a
state-owned transmission system. Mr. Davis says that the authority is part
of what he sees as a "hybrid" system where public power plays an important
role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business.

Reviving the Utilities

Having healthy utilities is extremely important, says the governor. He adds
that he has been working hard to revive the state's two biggest utilities,
the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern
California Edison Co. subsidiary of Edison International. But as the state's
role in the electricity business has grown, the utilities don't seem as
essential as they once did.

This is one reason the governor has had difficulty getting a rescue package
for Edison through the state legislature. The plan, among other things,
calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission system for $2.76 billion
and envisions the utility eventually resuming some power-buying chores.
Talks over a similar rescue package for Pacific Gas failed and that utility
filed for bankruptcy-law protection.

With the state locking up so much of California's future power needs,
legislators openly wonder whether utility-rescue efforts are worth the
billions of dollars they would require. In 2003, for instance, long-term
contracts will cover 90% of the state's projected buying needs. "What does
it mean for Edison to take over the role [of buying power] if the state
already has signed all these contracts?" asks State Sen. Debra Bowen, a
Democrat who heads the senate's energy committee.

Nonetheless, the governor says he is "cautiously optimistic" the legislature
soon will approve an Edison rescue package.

Mr. Davis has been deeply enmeshed in almost every aspect of the electricity
mess this year, after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning
crisis. The state's utility-deregulation law, which was enacted in 1996,
worked fairly well until May of last year. Under the deregulation plan, the
state's investor-owned utilities sold off many of their power plants to
other companies and repurchased that electricity through a state-sponsored
auction. Consumer rates were frozen and customers were given the option to
buy electricity from nonutility retail suppliers.

But tight electricity supplies and a flawed auction system led to a sharp
rise in wholesale power costs. With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas and
Edison racked up multibillion-dollar deficits. In January, Mr. Davis
declared an emergency and put the state into the power-buying business.

Since then, he hasn't been bashful about exercising his emergency powers.
When Mr. Davis couldn't get legislative permission to borrow money
short-term for power purchases, he signed an executive order authorizing the
state to borrow up to $5 billion from commercial lenders. That borrowing is
supposed to be repaid from a roughly $13 billion municipal-bond issue, the
biggest in U.S. history, scheduled for later this year.

In another executive order, the governor suspended emission standards for
power plants to let them run more hours during the peak-demand periods. And
the state has hired a small army of energy consultants and traders.

Despite such actions, some think Mr. Davis isn't being forceful enough. For
example, the state senate last week passed a resolution supporting the
governor's power to "commandeer power plants" if he deems such a step to be
necessary. Mr. Davis has said he doesn't have any plans currently to take
such an action.

'Crisis of Governance'

The electricity mess has produced "the most extraordinary crisis of
governance we've had in California in the postwar period," says Bruce Cain,
director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of
California at Berkeley. Mr. Cain says more power has been placed in the
governor's hands and, as a result, the state has "gotten away from the
separation of powers and the checks and balances that we expect in American
government."

Mr. Davis says his actions have been essential and are working. He credits
the long-term power contracts with helping to cool the spot market for
electricity, where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply. In June, the
state paid an average price of $167 a megawatt hour for electricity. That
was down from $243 in May, though still far above the $25-to-$27 range of
two years ago.

But some worry about how this rush to address a short-term problem will
affect the longer-term future. An economic forecast issued late last month
warned that continued heavy state involvement and spending in the
electricity business could produce enough of a drag on the California
economy to reduce state output by a total of $90 billion by 2005 and lead to
higher unemployment. "California is at a crossroads" between what amounts to
a "state takeover of the electricity industry" and a more market-oriented
approach to fixing the problem, says the joint study by the Anderson
business school at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Cambridge
Energy Research Associates.

Under a law enacted in February, none of the tens of billions of dollars of
state electricity purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent
by the Public Utilities Commission. That's an immunity that regulated
utilities in the old regime could only dream of. Then, if they spent too
much, the PUC could make their shareholders take a hit. Under the new
system, any purchasing missteps the state makes will be borne by consumers.

"It scares the hell out of me," says Henry Duque, a Republican PUC member
appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. "The state is so busy looking after
its own interests. ... Who's looking out for the ratepayer?"

PUC President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, acknowledges that the
commission's authority has been seriously eroded. Under the new law, the
commission is supposed to charge consumers for whatever sum the Water
Resources Department spends on energy. She hopes to hold hearings to review
the spending "even if we can't do much about the result."

Gov. Davis says concern about less oversight of power purchases is a "bogus"
issue. "It is not as if a private company or utility was making the
decisions. The PUC doesn't need to second-guess the decisions of a public
body," he says.

But other state moves suggest there's a role for oversight. The state is
only now doing a conflict-of-interest inquiry after several of its new
energy hires filled out disclosure forms that showed they held stock in big
power suppliers to the state. The governor's press secretary, Steve
Maviglio, says he doesn't know whether they were asked about their holdings
before being hired. He says the state will take "appropriate action" where
conflicts of interest are found.

The rush to beef up an outgunned state energy team may have contributed to
the hiring problem. Early on, "we had two or three people sitting around and
dealing with" big and savvy electricity suppliers, says Mr. Davis, almost
like a "tee-ball team playing the New York Yankees."

The state has since hastily assembled a group of about 20 energy traders,
headed by a 30-year-old manager with one year of experience in the energy
business. The manager, Susan Lee, has held four jobs in the past four years
and is getting paid up to $480,000 over two years for her services. Ms. Lee
declines to comment.

Good Enough

Even so, Mr. Davis argues, state negotiators did well enough. They managed
to help lower current power costs, he notes, although that required signing
deals that could force the state to "pay a little more" than it otherwise
would have in the years ahead. "I think Californians are willing to accept
that bargain," he says.

Still, he and some other state leaders are urging the PUC to revoke a
fundamental tenet of deregulation: the right of consumers to shop around for
low-cost electricity. Removing this option is essential to prevent a "jail
break" of customers seeking prices lower than what the state must charge,
says Carl Wood, one of Mr. Davis's three Democratic appointees to the
five-member PUC. A flight of customers could leave too few to pay for
state-purchased power and repay the planned bonds. The PUC is scheduled to
vote in August on the request to revoke consumer choice.

Some users are concerned about being stuck with what amounts to a state
monopoly. "We don't want to lose our options" to shop for lower-cost
electricity, says Shawn Covell, a senior manager at Qualcomm Inc., the
telephone-equipment maker. Earlier this year, Qualcomm signed an agreement
to buy power from an alternative supplier, the kind of move state officials
seek to ban.

While consumer choice is in doubt, public disclosure has already been
lessened in some ways. For months, the state refused to divulge terms of
power deals it was signing, saying that doing so would harm negotiations on
additional contracts. It finally made public the long-term contracts this
month after a lawsuit by a group of newspapers, including The Wall Street
Journal. Details of short-term power purchases were disclosed for the first
time on July 9. They showed the state spent nearly $8 billion on spot-market
purchases in the first five months of 2001, exceeding its projections.

Some Davis allies are troubled. "Decisions are being made, with almost no
public discussion, that foreclose other options," says Ms. Bowen, the state
senator, who is close enough to the governor that she played his therapist
in the "Sopranos" skit. While Sen. Bowen says the governor needed to act
forcefully, she is troubled that so much power has been bought at what she
fears will prove to be extremely high prices in the years ahead. Still, she
voted for the bill that gave the executive branch carte blanche to make
those huge commitments.

The right to go to court also has been limited. Under a law soon to take
effect, challenges to certain aspects of the planned $13 billion bond issue
can be taken only to the state Supreme Court. That panel has accepted only
two utility-related cases over the past decade. Backers of the measure say
it gives adequate opportunity for review without unduly slowing the bond
offering.

'One Voice'

The state's enlarged role in the utility business was on display when
negotiators convened recently at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in
Washington to discuss alleged supplier overcharges. California's major
utilities played only a secondary role, even though they paid much of the
purported overcharges and ran up giant deficits in doing so. The governor
had named one of his advisers, Michael Kahn, as head of the 20-person state
delegation, and Mr. Kahn says the delegation "spoke with one voice -- mine."

Mr. Kahn told FERC that California was owed $8.9 billion in refunds. Others,
including the FERC administrative-law judge overseeing the talks, said the
number was probably much lower. The state wouldn't budge, and the talks
ended without an agreement. Last week the judge recommended that a
"trial-like" proceeding be held to sort out who owes what to whom.

Mr. Davis says the state will go to an actual court if it doesn't get all
the money it is seeking through the FERC proceedings. And he vows to do
whatever else is necessary to get California through the electricity crisis.
"I have no desire to subsume the legitimate role of the private sector," he
says. But, he adds, Californians got such a "raw deal" from the deregulation
mess that "I have had to had take a very militant, hard-line view."

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today 
and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again 
tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a 
chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose 
unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" 
hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be 
heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to 
support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the 
best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't 
available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute 
then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, 
since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the 
Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any 
agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most 
believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It 
will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it 
kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for 
that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General 
Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the 
next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting 
it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by 
Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his 
signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the 
Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not 
postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature 
will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to 
postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on 
the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not 
get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Sacramento is one goofy place.

Greetings Art.  Had a great time at the conference.  Thanks for inviting me.  
I have a comment about the proposed decision if you'd like it.  Let me know.  
What time do you need it?  And can I just email it to you?  It'll be quite

USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says.
By Gelu Sulugiuc

07/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online 
energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a 
simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. , 
EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with 
the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks 
told Reuters on Tuesday.
The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready 
to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers 
or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper. 
"I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an 
ownership position in any other exchange platform," Piper said. 
With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the 
highest volume of all energy electronic platforms. Most energy trading 
platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits. 
Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day. But while 
ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline 
one can only trade with Enron. 
"It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business," Piper said. 
Enron is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States. 
About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic 
platform. 
"As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue 
to grow," Piper said. 
The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals, 
steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics. 
"We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get 
more traction," Piper said. "There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't 
even tapped into yet." 
Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success. The Atlanta-based 
exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and 
plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its 
trade volumes. 
"Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different," Piper 
said. "But right now, there is room for the both of us." 
He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE. Many of the 
energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also 
Enron's biggest clients. 
"Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one," Piper said. 
INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS 
Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States, 
Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of 
ways to become more successful. 
"The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline," Piper 
said. "But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something 
different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional 
about it." 
One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible 
application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different 
markets and regions. It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal. 
But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many 
exchange. 
"We want to focus in providing our markets to others," he said. "In the near 
term, we're not changing that." 
The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not 
elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it. 
EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats 
off. 
"I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't 
work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong," said Frank Getman, chief 
executive of online energy exchange HoustonStreet. 
"If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the 
market, then people will continue to use your site." 
Enron's stock rose 41 cents to $49.53 a share on Tuesday in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

Dear John:
You're opening my flood gates, and I'm going to refrain from getting entirely 
upset.  

Please read the attached letter, which is the one that we sent to Dunn last 
week.  To wit:  according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents 
FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the 
alleged "overcharges."  John, combined, the government sellers, including CA 
munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, "overcharged" California by a 
factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have "overcharged."  
(See letter from Winters to Burton and Ose.)

So notes like this, are ill-informed.  I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and 
others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and 
LADWP.  Nettie Hoge is now being quoted as saying, "well, it's not the 
gouging.  that's not the problem.   it's the "profit motive" we've set up 
that's the problem."  so munis are victims of a disease (profits) they can't 
control.  everyone else is blood-sucking scum.  (in addition, please inform 
Bill that Sempra's contract with DWR is a drop in the bucket compared to 
others.  it's easy and perhaps even good politics to go after Sempra, but 
getting Sempra ain't going to come within a light year of solving our DWR 
contract problem.)

Sorry for the flame, but it's gotten extremely tiresome, and  it ain't 
personal; but the emperor has no clothes, which will increasingly become 
increasingly apparent.

all that aside, we've got other work that's more important, and i look 
forward to continue working on it. 

best,
jeff

Told Tamara the same.  She is contacting PG&E.

Jim

Jim, I think that the point of the "flurry" is that we in California ain't 
received anything from PG&E.  Seemed that Wanda, from her note, said that she 
is on top of it.  Can you check in with Tamara and find out what her issues 
are?  Greatly appreciated.  

(From what I heard on the phone last night, sounds like that little girl of 
yours is going to be an opera singer.)

There's been a flurry of e-mail on this.

My original question remains -- can whomever (in Govt Affairs) received the 
PX Credit calculation info from PG&E please let me know? 

(I am working on this on several fronts, i.e. with Wanda, Diann and Mary 
Lynne.  But I do need to see the PG&E info.)

Thanks.
Tamara
James D Steffes@ENRON
07/17/2001 07:47 AM
Did Jeff get this info?  

Jim

   

PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to 
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June 
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our 
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying 
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group 
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want 
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.

I think that you'll be fine for what you need it for on Thursday with the 
camper shell on .  Trust me.

FYI.  New amendments out on DA that Keeley's accepted that I'm faxing to you 
right now.  Also, it's 82XX we're talking about, not 83XX.  83XX is the bill 
that Wright's authoring with the Rs.

Also faxing to you Reliant's "Dear Dunn, Go to Hell, Sincerely, Reliant" 
letter.

Best,
Jeff

Vegas still sez best odds are on Edison going in.

	James D Steffes
	07/18/2001 03:48 PM
		 
The games continue in California.  

The date of suspension now being considered in 83xx is July 12.  We are still 
working (1) to define this in a way that is favorable to getting our recent 
DASR group authorized for DA service or (2) supporting some other solution.

Will keep everyone informed as information comes in.  

By the way, I've asked Evan Hughes for a detailed listing of how moving the 
date impacts our success ratio.

Jim

Both 82XX and 83XX are to be discussed in committee today.  Significantly, an 
amendment that is expected to be included in 82XX would establish July 12 as 
the start date for when the PUC may not authorize any new or replacement 
direct transactions.

By contrast, 83XX directs the commission to authorize direct transactions on 
an open enrollment basis not less than 2 times each year, conicident with the 
expiration of DWR purchases.

Nothing more yet from the CPUC on its intended action.

Six Months Later, Edison's Utility May Still End Up Bankrupt
By Liz Goldenberg

Rosemead, California, July 18 (Bloomberg) -- Even if California lawmakers=
=20
pass a rescue plan to bail out insolvent Southern California Edison, some=
=20
analysts say bankruptcy may be the only solution.=20

``The reason they haven't filed remains more of a mystery than when they wi=
ll=20
file,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright, a senior energy credit analyst at Raymond=
=20
James & Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida, who isn't recommending=
=20
buying any debt sold by California utilities.=20

``If the weather heats up or their creditors wise up, they'll have to go in=
to=20
bankruptcy,'' said Cartwright.=20

Six months after the state's No. 2 utility defaulted on its debt, Californi=
a=20
lawmakers are debating a rescue package designed to restore it to investmen=
t=20
grade status. Any failure to do so by Friday, when the legislature is=20
scheduled to adjourn for a month, may result in a collapse of negotiations=
=20
between the lawmakers, the governor, and the utility, and ultimately,=20
bankruptcy.=20

There are at least three versions under consideration, each targeting=20
different groups, such as large businesses or power suppliers, to help foot=
=20
the bill for the bailout. There isn't any agreement as to what the rescue=
=20
should look like, who will pay, and who is to blame for the situation.=20

Acceptable Option?=20

The bad news for the utility and its creditors is that ``bankruptcy seems t=
o=20
be an increasingly accepted option by the legislature,'' said Dorothea=20
Matthews, the senior utility analyst for CreditSights, Inc., a research fir=
m.=20

Any three unsecured creditors can file a petition to put the utility into=
=20
bankruptcy. Debt holders, banks, and power generators are Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison's unsecured creditors.=20

The original rescue, signed on Apr. 9, between Governor Gray Davis and Edis=
on=20
expires on Aug. 15. If legislative action isn't taken by then, either party=
=20
can back out.=20

That is something that Southern California Edison may do, ``given the delay=
s=20
that have plagued the rehabilitation process at virtually every stage,'' sa=
id=20
David Bodek, an analyst who covers the utilities industry for Standard &=20
Poor's, a credit rating company.=20

Edison may decide that its utility may fare better under the eye of a=20
bankruptcy judge rather than politicians.=20

The lawmakers' goal is to save the utility in a way that is palatable to th=
em=20
and to California voters. Stock and debt holders aren't a priority, analyst=
s=20
said.=20

Do the Right Thing=20

``Investors will brunt the majority of the pain here,'' said Raymond James'=
s=20
Cartwright. ``An investment thesis that requires a group of politicians to=
=20
get together and do the right thing is ill fated -- there is no way of=20
knowing what the state will or will not do.''=20

On a conference call yesterday with investors holding Southern California=
=20
Edison debt in default, Edison chief financial officer Ted Craver said that=
=20
while all the legislation being debated has returning the utility to=20
creditworthiness as a goal, the language needed to achieve that wasn't=20
included.=20

``This is the beginning of the legislative process'' that will go on for th=
e=20
next few days, he said.=20

Creditworthiness, which Edison officials say is the most important goal, is=
=20
determined by credit rating companies and investors, rather than by the=20
legislature or the utility.=20

Stay Tuned=20

``Our money is still on an eventual filing'' for bankruptcy, said=20
CreditSights' Matthews, who puts those chances at about 80 percent. ``Stay=
=20

warming up in the wings.''=20

Southern California Edison accrued more than $5.4 billion in debts as it pa=

he=20
utility owes banks more than $200 million for loans coming due on Sept. 15=

and has no access to the capital markets.=20

``With few notable exceptions, (utility) bondholders have been well served =

regulatory and political support for the financial well-being of'' utilitie=
s=20
such as Southern California Edison, S&P's Bodek said.=20

California's utilities have ``lacked such support over the past year, as=20

Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B    =20
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM=01;ET    =01;=20
=01;

By Mark Golden=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was=20
overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion wh=
en=20
an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was=
=20
taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week.=20

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid=20
operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its=
=20
estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the=
=20
judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers=
=20
and the state over potential refunds last week.=20

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the=
=20
state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been calle=
d=20
arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes "a=20
potential framework for settlement discussions," Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'=
s=20
chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.=20

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9=20
billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not=
=20
negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refund=
s=20
due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700=
=20
million.=20

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refun=
ds=20
and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.=20

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to=20
municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through=
=20
the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the Californi=
a=20
Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of=20
those purchases, the ISO made estimates.=20

"We know the volume (of the bilateral deals)," Hildebrandt said. "The refun=
d=20
amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market."=
=20

Resetting The Baseline=20

Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the=
=20
ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law f=
or=20
California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition=
=20
to sales to the California Department of Water Resources.=20

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news=
,=20
msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news,=
=20
msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has=
=20
also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fa=
ir=20
prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by=
=20
retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those=20
controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator=
=20
needed to meet demand each hour.=20

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagne=
r=20
recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be=
=20
modified when used retroactively to determine refunds.=20

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds mu=
ch=20
further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averag=
e=20
of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner=20
recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is=20
considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices wou=
ld=20
cut potential refunds sharply.=20

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back =
as=20
Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about=
=20
one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.=20

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of=20
Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May=
=20
2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.=20

"The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the=20
overcharges going back to May should be repaid," McCorkle said. "We just=20
maintain that position."=20

FERC Baseline Questioned=20

In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when=
=20
fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the pric=
e=20
cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have=
=20
been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet=20
demand.=20

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generato=
rs=20
be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.=20

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to=
=20
$7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.=20

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt=
=20
said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering=
=20
only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the=
=20
rewards for such withholding, he said.=20

"The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit us=
ed=20
would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect,"=20
Hildebrandt said in an interview.=20

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between=
=20
actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and fo=
r=20
every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO=20
released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares.=
=20

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his=
=20
numbers aren't justified.=20

"These are based on very tangible records," he said. "The idea that it's a=
=20
black box is misleading."=20

Greetings.  Hope all is well.  Trade you energy for broadband.  Whaddya say?

Best,
Jeff

Harry/Sue:

Have you looked at the places in 82XX that Scott FedEx-ed to you that 
implicate the "PX credit?"  I've gotta assume that Edison put it in, and I 
frankly, ain't had the chance to peek at it.  For that reason, I'm worried.  
Can you page me and let me know your take?

Best,
Jeff

Yep.  Thanks.

Not going to D.C. after all.

Now the bad news:  that means I'll likely have to come back to Sacramento, 
instead.

Love to catch up.  When you get a minute tomorrow page me (I'm mobile this 
week) and we can talk.  888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is an ACR issued today requesting comment on the Rate Agreement
reached by the CPUC and DWR (which I will send under separate cover).  The
ACR highlights certain aspects of the Agreement and asks for parties to
evaluate the effects of the Agreement and indicate what they believe the
consequences of its adoption would be.  Comments are due by August 1st.

The Agreement itself basically calls for DWR to set its revenue requirement
based on "Bond Related Costs" and "Operating Expenses" and for the
Commission to implement such revenue requirement.  It is up to DWR to
determine whether the revenue requirement is just and reasonable prior to
submitting it to the Commission.

Please let me know if Enron is interested in Commenting on the Agreement.

Jeanne Bennett

Attached is an assigned Commissioner ruling (ACR) inviting comment on the
proposed rate agreement between the California Dept. of Water Resources and
the California Public Utilities Commission.  Interested parties may file
comments with the Docket Office on or before August 1, 2001.

Please note that there are three attachments to the ACR. Attachment A, the
proposed rate agreement, is being forwarded to you as a separate PDF
document.  Attachment B, the relevant Water Code sections, is contained in
the body of the attached Word document.  Attachment C is the two page letter
from the DWR, the Dept. of Finance, and the Treasurer's Office to President
Lynch dated July 2, 2001.  Attachment C was previously distributed to the
A.00-11-038 et al service list in the Chief ALJ's ruling dated July 5, 2001.

Looks like Loretta's attempt to peel off the DWR contracts from the bonds at 
the PUC, which the Legislature has been contemplating but hasn't done 
anything about.

John:

I could be wrong about what I think Loretta's doing so make sure that 
somebody verifies before you pass on what I've said.  Could be totally wrong; 
but hope I'm right.

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's 
going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is 
it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with 
Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of 
the bill" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the 
night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and 
Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); 
the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

talked to pat.  he wants me to talk by phone rather than come to DC.  happy

The wierdness continues.....

In the Senate:
After Burton's "proclamation" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was 
"all Edison was getting, period," the bill was voted down in committee and 
never made it to the full Senate for a vote.
The bill will be "reconsidered" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same 
committee.  

In the Assembly:
Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched 
his vote and let it get out.
82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and 
now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning.
83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted 
out of committee and will go to appropriations today.

Will report back later this AM with any additional information.

Jeff

Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the 
Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full 
Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess; 
that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.

Other info from the conversation:
With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that "they're making it up as 
they go."
Any vote on fines, etc. would only a require a simple majority to pass.

Congressman Ose's staffer, Connie Lausten, is happy to do a phone call 
tomorrow.  Let me know what time you would like to do it.

Best,

Pat Shortridge

Scott:
Can you try to find me bios of these folks?  Thanks very much.
Jeff

Could not have happened to a nicer or more deserving bunch.  Congratulations 
and all the best.

Jeff

Yes, 11 PDT works for me.  Understand what you need.  Will do best to deliver.

John:

Here are two alternatives to the language in AB1X.

The language does two things:

1) ensures that DA customers' costs are shifted to utility customers.
2) ensures that DA customers' don't unfairly escape any costs (e.g., bond 
payments, etc.)

We're assuming that you'll shop these with Lenny and we'll work the Reps on 
SB 18?

Lemme know.

Best,
Jeff

415.505.6633

Correction:

1) ensures that DA customers' costs are NOT shifted to utility customers.

The Republicans are currently on the Senate floor arguing (noisily, 
repeatedly and passionately) that California (and the Senate in particular) 
is being hypocritical and intellectually dishonest in attacking and 
investigating private companies and ignoring munis.

One Senator specifically identified prices charged by LADWP and SMUD and 
compared those prices to Enron's (1/3 to 1/2 less than LADWP and SMUD 
charged).

Best,
Jeff

In the Senate:
Today the Senate passed out of committee SB18XX and is expected to pass the 
bill out of the full Senate sometime today.  
The bill would de-link 1) payment for bonds issued to repay General Fund 
dollars used to buy power from 2) payment for power contracts signed by DWR.
The Senate has thus far failed to get its version of the "Edison MOU" 
(SB78XX) out the necessary committees in order to get it to the floor for a 
vote by the full Senate.  
It is unclear at this point whether the Senate will try to vote the MOU bill 
out of the Senate, or focus solely on SB18XX (de-linking bonds from DWR 
contracts) prior to leaving for vacation.
Dunn got a resolution passed that permits his investigative committee to take 
depositions of individuals.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly has thus far failed to get an "MOU" (82XX or 83XX) voted out of 
the full Assembly, though expectations are that the Hertzberg bill (82XX) 
will get voted out of the Assembly today.

man, you ain't kiddin'.

This looks good.  Is there any value in assigning people to the agenda items, 
e.g., "Special Session"--Sandi and Sac lobbyists"?

Will do.  Sue Mara, my colleague in the SF office, will join the call.  Tom, 
what's your number?

Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the 
Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at 
a minimum.
In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it 
still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will 
keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to 
amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is 
growing.

In the Senate:
SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts
In the only bipartisan move to date, SB18XX passed out of two committees 
yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate.  
The bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget 
from payment of DWR contracts.
The bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of 
the DWR contracts.
The DWR contracts are being held up as the reason California must suspend, or 
end, Direct Access.
Republicans on the Assembly side are supportive of 18, but Hertzberg--the 
Speaker--has joined with the Governor's people in the view that the bill 
would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the State to 
substantial damages.
As a result, when the bill passes the Senate and gets over to the Assembly, 
its chances of passage there are low.
SB72XX---The Senate's MOU
The Senate's version of the MOU--SB72XX--limped out of its final committee 
yesterday before going to a vote by the full Senate, but its chances of 
passing the full Senate at this point are 50-50.
The problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting 
for a bill that will likely drive Edison into bankruptcy, while many other 
democrats fear it will look like they bailed out Edison----the courage and 
leadership is awesome.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly two versions of the MOU---AB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX)
The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue.
The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his 
own bill (82XX).
Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat 
(Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly 
Republicans.
In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail.
Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very 
difficult time getting a budget passed.
As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is 
trying to cobble together an alternative to 18.

Dude:
Thanks a million for getting the instruments.  Sorry to burden with the 
chore. See you in Cah-lo-rah-dee.

Best,
Jeff

Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy 
Former governor defends himself 
Carla Marinucci, Chronicle Political Writer
Friday, July 20, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/20/MN187903.DTL 
Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy 
deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for 
failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency 
powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis. 
"There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis 
on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics 
and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday. 
Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in 
jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic 
governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to 
blur perception of the current energy troubles. 
"They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And 
they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush," 
said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a 
triumph -- for Davis." 
But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power." 
Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis 
-- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, 
released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as 
the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not 
Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows. 
The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political 
adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history." 
"If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised 
one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday. 
"Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like 
Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his 
mess." 
The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as 
members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a 
California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White 
House's energy policy. 
But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of 
California's problems. "They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in 
California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. "And guess what? When you grow 
your state the way they have . . . it creates problems." 
Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures 
that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration. 
In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to 
seek state approval for new plants. 
While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I 
thought the flaws would be addressed." 
"We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding 
that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the 
legislation. "(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while." 
But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's 
energy woes -- had benefits for the state. 
Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build 
new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians." 
Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns 
about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early 
1970s -- to build large power plants. 
Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions 
made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with our 
handiwork." 
Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the 
California Energy Commission about coming blackouts. 
And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and 
skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a 
crisis: emergency powers. 
Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested 
it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used 
his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the 
bridges within 65 days. 
South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the 
energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- 
blown statewide energy crisis.

Harry, Jeff, & Sue --

I keep getting these notes from Jeanne on different matters.

1. Is there any way to get Jeanne to start using non-CPUC terms to define the 
dockets (e.g., SCE PE Advice process)?  I have a very difficult time trying 
to figure out what material is being discussed.

2. I would like to have meeting to establish our priorities and leadership 
roles for the CPUC going forward.  Not sure how our decisionmaking is taking 
place.  I know that Harry has been taking a lot of the lead on these matters, 
but want to make sure that from a personnel focus we are doing our best.

I'll ask Linda Noske to set up a call for this Thursday am.

Thanks,

Jim

As part of its Memorandum of Understanding with DWR, SDG&E has filed the
attached advice letter.  If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer
a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue
Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall
from the implementation of AB 265).  The $104 million represents the
overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to
customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would
include direct access customers.  SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that
it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be
used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers).
SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case.  It was
opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission.

Protests on this advice filing are due August 6th.  Please let me know if
Enron is interested in protesting.

Hi everyone,

I know that AReM is not opposing SB 78xx (Polanco/Sher) because it is silent
on direct access; however, I want to recommend that the position be changed
to oppose.  I have spoken with Norm and he asked that I send this out to for
comment.
Please look at the bill and specifically Section 13, on Page 35 (see below).
I believe that if this bill were to become law direct access in SCE's,
PG&E's and SDG&E territories (I believe the section stands alone so it
wouldn't matter if PG&E accepted the same deal or not) would be dead.  In
summary, the bill would essentially allow any IOU to go back into the
generation business and require the CPUC to approve rates that are
sufficient to cover their reasonable cost of operation, investment and
provide for a reasonable rate of return (I don't believe this is cost-based
rates).  The CPUC is given broad latitude over conducting proceedings,
issuing orders or anything else that may be necessary to accomplish the goal
of assuring that service provided by IOU's is adequate.  Section 13 will
kill competition, eliminate direct access and create new stranded costs.
And, to add insult to injury the State Power Authority may be their partners
in crime.
As to the politics of the bill it was just amended to be a majority vote
bill.  Burton has said it is this bill or nothing.  SCE is opposing the bill
but there are several lobbyist who think this is all an ambush and SCE would
love this bill.

Please comment on my above analysis.  I would love to be wrong on this one.

Attached is an ACR issued today requesting comment on the Rate Agreement
reached by the CPUC and DWR (which I will send under separate cover).  The
ACR highlights certain aspects of the Agreement and asks for parties to
evaluate the effects of the Agreement and indicate what they believe the
consequences of its adoption would be.  Comments are due by August 1st.

The Agreement itself basically calls for DWR to set its revenue requirement
based on "Bond Related Costs" and "Operating Expenses" and for the
Commission to implement such revenue requirement.  It is up to DWR to
determine whether the revenue requirement is just and reasonable prior to
submitting it to the Commission.

Please let me know if Enron is interested in Commenting on the Agreement.

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL 
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern 
California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an 
uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of 
Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 
billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and 
Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house." 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized." 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
"It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied." 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
"As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done." 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight 
bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled
By Jennifer Coleman 
Associated Press Writer 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters 
the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility 
Southern California Edison. 
The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and 
Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts 
amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in 
the last year. 
"I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out 
of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to 
creditworthiness," said Polanco, D-Los Angeles. 
Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned 
Friday night without voting on a similar measure. 
The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial 
and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by 
Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy. 
Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its 
transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its 
estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay 
skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 
Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year 
option to buy Edison's grid. 
That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it 
"neither needs nor deserves. 
"I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion 
of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support 
deregulation," Johnson said during floor debate. "The idea of Edison as the 
victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists 
bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation." 
During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials 
helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and 
then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. 
Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a 
schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding 
between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by 
Aug. 15. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said Friday. 
For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker 
Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, 
has to reach Davis. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house." 
The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's 
offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by 
Edison ratepayers over 10 years. 
The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of "green" energy 
resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy 
service. 
The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is 
considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to 
"iron out the bills' differences," said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. 
Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer 
break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. 
"I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry 
about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and 
other major issues to deal with in that last month," the governor said.

plz call re: dunn.  thx, jeff  415.782.7822.

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget 
and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an "Edison 
MOU." Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and 
passed through both houses by COB Monday.  

In the Senate:
The "Edison MOU":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison 
MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays 
QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because 
the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the 
suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic 
is strong from a legal perspective. 
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the 
Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not 
pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The "Dunn Investigation":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the 
first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron "complies."
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the 
full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican 
party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the 
date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not 
to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 
20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the 
likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return 
until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the 
budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much 
influence over its own party--the Democrats.  
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not 
reconvened. 
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says 
it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go 
back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his 
Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough 
votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released 
on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

Jeff

NOT-SO-GOLDEN STATE 
Looks Like a Recession 
Economy on the edge

N144927.DTL 
California, the world's fifth largest economy, the global capital of 
technology and entertainment, is teetering on the brink of a serious 
recession. 
Unemployment is rising, job creation is falling and respected forecasters are 
painting a bleak future for the state. 
California is not alone. Nationally, the employment picture is also 
troubling. Income is flat. Industrial production has been shrinking for nine 
months. Only the mighty consumer has kept the economy going. 
The key problem is the slowdown in information technology spending, so 
important for California. Once the engine of productivity growth, and the 
source of rising standards of living, the double-digit pace of those spending 
increases slowed dramatically, beginning in the second half of last year. 
Since then, Silicon Valley companies have experienced sales declines of 5 to 
10 percent, not calamitous drops, but compared to the 40 percent growth they 
had been used to, an enormous gap. Hence these companies have been cutting 
back on everything from production to personnel to facilities. The "new 
economy," it turns out, is not immune to the basic laws of economics. 
Nationally, the most respected "blue chip" private forecasters believe we 
will avoid a recession. They see the economy growing just over 1 percent this 
year and by 2 to 3 percent next year. 
Having been more optimistic for some years, I became more pessimistic last 
year, and remain so despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts and the 
Bush administration's tax refunds. Whether we skirt the technical definition 
of a recession -- two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- will be a 
close call. We should see a modest recovery late this year, and a pick-up of 
steam in 2002. 
The California economy is in for a rougher time, at least in the short term. 
And this time -- unlike the early 1990s, when Southern California bore the 
brunt of the severe downturn in the defense industry -- the Bay Area will be 
hit much harder. While the region grew much faster than the rest of the state 
in the '90s, most of the symbols of that growth -- full employment, exploding 
property values, shrinking commercial vacancy rates -- are already history. 
Workers who just a short time ago were getting BMWs as a signing bonus are 
now being laid off. 
Statewide unemployment -- 5.1 percent last month -- is likely to increase 
another percentage point or more as layoffs continue in high tech and 
aerospace. Still -- and here's some good news -- Bay Area unemployment, even 
in Santa Clara County, which took a major hit in June, is still below the 
statewide rate. In per capita income, the San Francisco and San Jose 
metropolitan areas are ranked first and second nationwide, 75 percent above 
the national average. 
What of the longer term? California faces serious problems, not the least of 
which is the energy mess, which has exacerbated the current slowdown. Our 
recovery will probably lag several quarters behind the rest of the country. 
But the long-term picture is brighter. Information technologies have brought 
about permanent productivity improvements and transformed virtually every 
major industry in the so-called "old economy." Such enhancements will 
themselves result in renewed information technology spending, if not at the 
frenetic pace of the late 1990s. 
The main concern is whether California will degenerate into an even more 
anti-business climate. We are already viewed by the business community as an 
overtaxed, over-regulated state. Gov. Gray Davis' rhetoric, and some of his 
actions, during the energy debacle have only added to the impression. While 
Davis deserves credit for using the bully pulpit to encourage energy 
conservation, his demagogic attacks on "outside" energy companies, and the 
suggestion that California should go it alone, are not only poor policy 
solutions but suggest a degree of economic illiteracy on his part. 
His plan to have the state play an expanded role in energy production and 
transportation will require the expenditure of billions of dollars. Do we 
believe the state government could make those investment decisions wisely, 
efficiently and devoid of politics? California would be better off if the 
governor got out of the energy business. 
The state will also continue to pay for the financial mishandling of the 
energy situation. The initial refusal by Davis' appointees on the Public 
Utilities Commission to allow utilities to enter long-term contracts worsened 
the shortages and sharpened the price spikes. Then, at the peak of the market 
frenzy, the governor's office negotiated long term contracts that lock the 
state into paying unnecessarily high prices. And by keeping prices to 
consumers unrealistically controlled, he has passed the burden for energy 
costs on to the taxpayers -- current and future. 
With all the problems and missteps, however, there is great reason to be 
optimistic about California's economic future. We are still a beacon of 
opportunity. We still attract the best and the brightest. We are still the 
best incubator of new ideas and businesses. 
However, our current woes should remind us not to take economic growth for 
granted. With better state policy -- lower tax rates, less regulation, 
reforms to improve our schools, and a more efficient energy and 
transportation infrastructure -- California will reemerge as the leader of a 
strong national economy, providing opportunity, mobility and still higher 
standards of living.

Right now, appears they're focused on the budget, but could take up energy.  
There appears to continue to be considerable uncertainty----seems that even

Wholesale Competition Contributed to Trend of Lower Power Prices, According 
to New EPSA Study

PR Newswire
07/23/01, 1:00p
(Copyright , 2001, PR Newswire)

WASHINGTON, July 23 /PRNewswire/ -- Calls for a return to cost-plus rate 
regulation in the wake of the California power crisis are misplaced, 
according to an independent study released today that found that competitive 
markets contributed to a 36 percent decline in retail electricity prices 
among surveyed utilities.

"That decrease is in sharp contrast to the increases that consumers 
experienced in the days of solely cost-plus rate regulation," said Electric 
Power Supply Association President Lynne H. Church, who released the findings 
during a media luncheon in conjunction with the group's summer membership 
meeting. "This analysis is evidence that we should continue to move forward 
toward more competition in order to apply downward pressure on prices."

The study: "Assessing the 'Good Old Days' of Cost-Plus Regulation," analyzed 
sales data for 60 of the nation's investor-owned utilities during 1985-1999, 
when traditional cost-plus rate regulation began evolving toward more 
competition. Complete sales figures for 2000 were not yet available when the 
study was completed. The study was commissioned by EPSA and conducted by 
Craig Roach, Ph.D, principal of Boston Pacific Co.

"In the wake of the California power crisis, some people have expressed a 
longing for a return to the 'good' old days of cost-plus regulation, but 
those days were far from good," Roach said. "People seem to forget that, in 
the days of cost-plus regulation between 1970 and 1985, inflation-adjusted 
electricity prices actually increased 25 percent for residential customers 
and increased 86 percent for industrial/commercial customers."

"So much for the good old days," Church said. "The price increases under 
cost-plus regulation were precisely what drove the start of electricity 
competition in the early and mid-1980s."

During the 1985-1999 period, according to the analysis, inflation-adjusted 
electricity prices decreased an average 30 percent for residential customers 
and 36 percent for industrial/commercial customers.

"We should not allow the problems in California to cast a false shadow on 
competition," Church said. "The evidence presented in this study makes it 
clear that it would be counterproductive and unwise to go back to the old 
ways."

"It is important to understand that what happened in California resulted, in 
part, from market rules that prohibited basic risk management," Roach said. 
"Specifically, utilities were required to take on the risk of selling at a 
fixed price to customers, but not allowed to manage that risk by arranging 
contracts with fixed-price suppliers or use other risk management tools. 
Managing risk appropriately benefits consumers, and risk management is more 
efficient and effective in a truly competitive regime."

"This study bolsters our belief that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
should continue to move expeditiously toward more efficient wholesale 
markets, states should continue to move quickly toward opening their retail 
power markets, and Congress should quickly adopt comprehensive legislation to 
help them along," Church said. 

Note: A copy of the complete study is available at 
www.bostonpacific.com/powerprices . 

EPSA is the national trade association representing independent power 
producers and power marketers active in U.S. and global power markets. As 
suppliers of reliable, clean, competitively priced electricity, EPSA members 
seek to bring the benefits of competition to all electricity customers.

? When the Assembly reconvenes at 4:00 PDT it appears they will likely take 
up the budget only; there is no word at this time that they will take up AB 
82XX, and they do not appear to have the votes needed to pass it even if they 
did take it up.  The fact that Burton has come out against a conference 
committee is an additional disincentive to work on 82XX.  Therefore, at this 
time it appears unlikely that 82XX will be passed before the recess.

? Instead, it appears likely that a working group will be established to work 
on SB 78XX during the recess.  This group will likely include members of 
Keeley's, Hertzberg's and Burton's staffs.  These staff members may be 
allowed to go on vacation for a few weeks before returning to work on the MOU.

? The Assembly must pass the budget before they can recess.  It is unclear at 
this time if it will be possible to do so tonight or if it will take a few 
days; the Senate, by leaving, has put the Assembly in a difficult position in 
that they cannot amend anything.  Also, the four Republicans who voted for 
the budget last week are under significant pressure not to vote for the 
trailer bills, meaning that Speaker Hertzberg has to find other Republicans 
willing to cross party lines -- a difficult and very unpopular thing to do at 
this point.  This is likely why the Assembly is meeting so late in the day -- 
to allow Hertzberg time to work on the 8 or 9 Republicans on his list.

How long do you think it will take for Davis' people and the crazies in the 
Legislature to link the study and PRI to the funders?

Quick update to Jim's note:

Still appears that the Assembly only has enough left in it tonite to deal 
with the budget and then recess; and it is still unclear if they'll get 
enough Republicans to go along tonite, or be forced to come back tomorrow to 
try again.
If the Legislature does get the budget done and recesses without addressing 
the energy issues, then decision-making on some key issues---Direct Access in 
particular---will fall back in the PUC's lap. (The Legislature is scheduled 
to be out until August 20th.)
The PUC has scheduled a vote on whether to suspend DA, the rate agreement 
with DWR, DWR's rev. req. and other issues on August 23rd.
PUC President Loretta Lynch has said that she wants to issue a proposed 
decision on these issues sometime between now and the first week of August.
As Jim points out, we continue to try to hammer out favorable outcomes for 
Direct Access and cost allocation in both forums----the Legislature and the 
PUC.

Jeff

The attached note is from Enron's hired lobbyist in Sacramento.  Looks like 
the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on 
energy restructuring (could continue to change).

There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess.  Enron 
is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich).  We will try to 
push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs.

On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward. 
The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to 
lower costs for spot market purchases).  The end result, if their figures are 
correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going 
forward (we are trying to validate).  The key is that now the Retained 
Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail 
customers.

Thanks,

Jim

For those of you who don't already know, the Senate passed its version of
the SCE MOU, SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher) which requires users over 500 kw to foot
the bill for SCE's entire undercollection and it eliminates DA completely.
This largely represents TURN's proposal.  The Senate also passed a budget
and has since adjourned until August 20.

The Assembly had been considering two MOUs, ABX 82 (Keeley) and ABX 50
(Wright).  Both bills had difficulty attracting a majority of votes given
their different approaches to dealing with SCE.  ABX 82 for example, had
large users picking up most of the tab for SCE's undercollection whereas ABX
50 split those charges among all users.  Both bills provided for some type
of direct access and ABX 82 also provided for a purchase of the transmission
system.  In light of the difficulty in passing either bill, it appears as if
the Assembly will shelve both proposals today in order to amend SBX 78 over
the summer break.  An internal legislative working group may be formed to
draft amendments but this has not been confirmed.  Large users have begun
drafting extensive amendments recognizing that in its current form SBX 78
has very little to offer.

The Assembly will try to pass the final portion of the budget today and
recess until August 20.

Quick update to Jim's note:

Still appears that the Assembly only has enough left in it tonite to deal 
with the budget and then recess; and it is still unclear if they'll get 
enough Republicans to go along tonite, or be forced to come back tomorrow to 
try again.
If the Legislature does get the budget done and recesses without addressing 
the energy issues, then decision-making on some key issues---Direct Access in 
particular---will fall back in the PUC's lap. (The Legislature is scheduled 
to be out until August 20th.)
The PUC has scheduled a vote on whether to suspend DA, the rate agreement 
with DWR, DWR's rev. req. and other issues on August 23rd.
PUC President Loretta Lynch has said that she wants to issue a proposed 
decision on these issues sometime between now and the first week of August.
As Jim points out, we continue to try to hammer out favorable outcomes for 
Direct Access and cost allocation in both forums----the Legislature and the 
PUC.

Best,
Jeff

The attached note is from Enron's hired lobbyist in Sacramento.  Looks like 
the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on 
energy restructuring (could continue to change).

There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess.  Enron 
is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich).  We will try to 
push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs.

On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward. 
The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to 
lower costs for spot market purchases).  The end result, if their figures are 
correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going 
forward (we are trying to validate).  The key is that now the Retained 
Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail 
customers.

Thanks,

Jim

The Assembly passed the budget late last night.
The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill.
There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week 
comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a 
deal.
For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the 
Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th 
of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early.
The activity now moves to the PUC.

Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for 
years

(Published July 24, 2001) 
The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more 
intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee 
sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn 
over internal documents. 
Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has 
adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple 
investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has 
become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians. 
At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted 
criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love 
to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a 
tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With 
less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based 
companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor 
suppliers to California. 
Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that 
Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of 
President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the 
rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are 
interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also 
filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading 
data. 
Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating 
Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality 
agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph 
Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a 
report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction." 
Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's 
happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears 
about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would 
data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data 
be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands 
of class-action attorneys? 
Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will 
be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative 
purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of 
turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was 
leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state 
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that 
private lawyers are working closely with investigators. 
Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove 
collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few 
dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings, 
that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create 
artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted 
the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent 
System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that 
ISO had ordered the plant operational changes. 
Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now 
under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents 
that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation. 
Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary. 
Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help 
in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said 
he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides. 
The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes 
will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at 
least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their 
utility bill checks.

Figures show state lost big on extra power 
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001 
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK 
Mercury News 
State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month 
selling surplus electricity for less than it cost. 
The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a 
loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much 
excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts -- 
and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be 
needed. 
A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray 
Davis' energy policies are needlessly costing consumers. 
``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, who 
requested details of the state's surplus power sales. ``The government needs 
to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more 
money.'' 
A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 million figure outright but said it 
is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably 
is less. 
``It's a number I'm sure he likes very much, but it's definitely an estimated 
number, and it could be far lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the 
state Department of Water Resources. 
Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher. 
The state has spent $415 million on power so far this month. 
State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer 
conservation have left California holding more power than it needs. The 
revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying 
top dollar for power, expecting shortages this summer. 
Price that was paid 
The state bought 3.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an 
average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, according to a response Friday by 
the Department of Water Resources to Campbell's inquiry. The state has sold 
178,000 surplus megawatt-hours in July at an average price of $37, the 
department said. 
Based on those average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus 
power, which it sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost. 
A more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased 
power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a 
``portfolio.'' 
Purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour 
as well as cheaper spot-market buys. 
State officials last week said they were selling surplus at $15 to $30 a 
megawatt-hour, while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $1. 
Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 5 percent of California's 
July purchases, which totaled $415 million. The $6.5 million from sales will 
help lower the state's power bill, he said, adding that utilities routinely 
sell some extra electricity. 
``Despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying 
operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of 
situations,'' Hidalgo said. ``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal 
operating procedure for any utility.'' 
Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, have 
said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a 
cost of doing business. 
The suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include the 
big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gouging 
``snakes.'' Among them are Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso 
Power Services, Mirant, Reliant Energy and Williams Energy. 
`Best bid' taken 
Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find. 
``It's only reasonable to get the best bid you can,'' he said. 
Campbell said the $14 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or 
taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a private utility could be 
forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable. 
State officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power 
is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million in May to $25 million 
this month, in part because the state has so much power.

Please let me know if your company has, or will be cutting a check to
Edison to repay any discount received under interruptible program
contracts.

We are working on legislation that would allow companies to keep a
proportionate amount of the discount received between November 2000 and

to curtail.

Thank you.

Well hey there to you!  Man, long time.  I figured you must be married with 
kids by now.

Well, I can tell you that my summer's probably a whole heckuvalot better 
since I'm not in the summer class.  I'm assuming that you're doing it in 
order to get out in 5 semesters?  I decided to do it in 6, but wil only have 
to take one class the last semester.

Been thinking about you (as I've watched my Sun stock crater).  How's it 
going?  What the heck you doing there?

I'm surprised that you've lasted that long in the South Bay.  Good luck 
looking for a place in SF----smart move.

I'm around in August and definitely up for a Happy Hour.

Don't be a Stranger, Stranger.

Hey there!

How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
class has been a new low point in terms of educational
value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now. 

Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
bay much. 

Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
you around?

Let me know how you are...

Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly 
members back.  So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make 
a run at this.  We are getting more information and mobilizing industry.  
Some key considerations:

The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something 
done.
The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having "done 
nothing."
Becauase the Assembly has thus far "done nothing," the only thing it has in 
front of it is 78.
The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill 
was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a 
reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order 
to get the support necessary to get voted out.
Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where 
the Senate would have to approve it.
Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and 
call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that 
Burton's inclined to come back.
In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes 
to 78, that "it's 78 or nothing."  Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e., 
Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's 
amendments.  Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye 
on the issues.
All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be 
counted out.  We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could 
move. 
Will report back as information becomes available.
Best,
Jeff

The Assembly is tentatively scheduled to take up SBX2 78 in committee on
Friday.  If the bill passes, it may go straight to the Assembly floor that
night.  The Senate may go in either late Friday or early Monday to take up
the bill as amended although this has not been confirmed.

Amendments to SBX 78 may be available tomorrow.

Thanks very much, Ken.  This is a helpful start.

Interesting points.  However, I don't ever recall you agreeing with every 
Commission decision on disallowances.  And I know you wouldn't establish 
differing standards for IOUs and state water agencies.  

I just hope that this isn't the tip of the iceberg.

haven't heard anyone else describe him as a dim bulb.

Shame on you, Jeff!  I expect this sort of thing from inexperienced 
reporters and dim bulbs like Campbell.  But you KNOW that this sort of 
thing is no big deal.  And when did the PUC ever disallow these kinds of 
losses for the utilities?  I don't think my memory has gotten that bad.   MIKE

Attached is an Assigned Commissioner's Ruling issued yesterday by
Commissioners Lynch and Brown soliciting comments on the Revenue Requirement
submitted by DWR on July 23rd.

The revenue requirement is increased from the $9.2 billion submitted in May
to $13.072 billion, but covers a longer period of time (the period of
January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002).  The revenue requirement is
expected to pay for 118,930 GWh of power.  The revenue requirement is
divided among the three UDCs as follows (1) PG&E = $5.2 billion; (2) SCE =
$5.8 billion; and (3) SDG&E = $2.1 billion. The revenue requirement was
divided among the three UDCs based on a uniform cost per MWh of net short
energy purchased by DWR.  The bond proceeds will be applied in a manner to
supplement the revenue from the customers to DWR such that the net revenue
requirement falls within the retail rate adjustments adopted by the CPUC for
PG&E and SCE (i.e., the three cents), and assumes a comparable rate
adjustment for SDG&E

The ACR asks for comments on the revenue requirement submitted by DWR,
particularly in the areas of (a) the relationship between the UDCs retained
generation revenue requirement and the DWR revenue requirement ; and (b)
DWR's request for the establishment of "specific charges payable to DWR for
the power sold by DWR to retail end use customers" (e.g., should this be in
a form of separate rate element or in the form of a gross revenue amount to
be derived from rates).

The ACR also requests more information from DWR.  Specifically it requests
information on (a) the revenue DWR has already received from the UDCs; (2)
how the revenue requirement for ancillary services was calculated; (c) more
specifics on Operating Costs; and (4) a numerical illustration of the
derivation of the 1.65 cents per kWh as representing the average portion of
the 3 cent rate increase that DWR needs to generate its $13 billion revenue
requirement (a figure that was apparently reported in the press).  DWR is
suppose to serve this information on the Commission and parties to the
proceeding by Thursday the 26th.

There will be a technical workshop held on Friday the 27th to address DWR's
revenue requirement.

It is the Commission's intent after the receipt and review of comments to
issue a PD and to vote on the revenue requirement at its August 23rd
meeting.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like to submit comments
on the revenue requirement or have me attend the workshop.

Jeanne Bennett

Attached is an advance draft of a joint assigned Commissioners' ruling
asking parties to comment on DWR's revised revenue requirement by August 3,
2001, asking for additional information from DWR, and setting a workshop for
July 27, 2001 at 9:00 am at the Commission to discuss the revenue
requirement assumptions with representatives from DWR.

Due to computer difficulties, this ruling will be filed with the Docket
Office tomorrow, July 25.

Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occured 
with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest version 
of an "Edison MOU":

The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet 
that the Assembly would not convene on Friday.
He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen until 
they get back from recess on the 20th of August.
The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether 
they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess.
From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it 
appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.  The proposal:
Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be 
pressured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance)
Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with small 
customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing).
Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's 
transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider 
buying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly)
Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but 
place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed to 
suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions.)
Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to 
the one created in Texas).
The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill 
passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the new 
version of 82XX.  The two would go together to create the Assembly's newest 
proposal.
If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult 
time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate has 
considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the Assembly 
version.
Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for 
recess as soon as we hear.

Best,
Jeff

Details are still rough and the situation is very fluid, but here is what is 
currently going on:

Senators Hertzberg and Keeley are amending both SB 78XX and AB 82XX.  Upon an 
initial read, it appears that they are doing the following:
? AB 82XX has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the 
renewables portfolio.  (The core/non-core business provisions, the 
transmission asset purchase, etc. all appear to have been deleted.)  Both of 
these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by 
members last week when the bill was first debated. 
? It appears amendments have been made to SB 78XX but the extent of these 
changes are not yet known.  
? At the beginning of both amended bills, it states, "As proposed to be 
amended into SB_XX."   This means that amendments to SB 78 could be 
incorporated into AB 82, and vice versa.  Another possibility is an entirely 
new bill.  

Folks:

Having printed the paper, I found out that the file received only contains 
half the paper.  Worse, the authors seemed to have left a page out of the 
document they distributed.  You currently have the first half.  As soon as we 
get a complete version of the paper--including the mysterious missing 
page--we'll distribute.

Jeff

plz see email for CA Leg update.  Best, Jeff

While Leslie was out I had a brief discussion with Tycholiz, et al.  They're 
going to pull together an outline of the things they're thinking about and 
get back to us on it for discussion.

Best,
Jeff

	Susan M Landwehr/ENRON@enronXgate
	07/25/2001 09:57 PM
		 
Leslie--I don't know whatever happened to this discussion?  I suggested to 
Jeff that I would be available off and on during the week, but I think he was 
nuts with the legislative session.  SHould we try again or have you already 
discussed?
I am really only available Monday am (I am on a well-deserved vacation next 
week), but if that works for you, that would be great.  Jeff is pretty full 
up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.  
What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, 
particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES 
still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov 
Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state 
commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both 
Sue and Jeff on this.

leslie, I would like to talk to you and jeff regarding ENA's plans to talking 
to the PUC regarding hedging activities... let's do this early next week.  Is 
there a time that is best to schedule. 

BT 

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate 
matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:  PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is 
generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor 
plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
    SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused 
to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC 
approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  
(draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and 
passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to 
begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I 
suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to 
the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to 
improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  
We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and 
can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).

Just got a call from Hertzberg.
He pulled the plug last night on trying to get an Edison MOU finished by this 
weekend.
Too complicated; too rushed; he couldn't pull it off, but intends to  
continue working with folks.
He said that likelihood now is that the Assembly will recess, come back on 
the 20th, and try again.
Since the Legislature has adjourned without resolving the Edison/energy 
issue, the focus will now be at the CPUC, which is scheduled to rule on a 
rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC, Direct Access suspension, etc. at 
its August 23rd meeting.

Best,
Jeff

Please forward to anyone else who needs to receive this.

Go Dick.

FYI.  Hertzy called.  He pulled plug.  Assembly's going home.  See email.

Along with the TW order setting a hearing, the FERC has also imposed new 
reporting requirements for deliveries starting August 1.  The questions ask 
TW to provide daily nominated, scheduled and delivered at Cal. border 
points.  I think this data will lead FERC to further ask about why the 
scheduled number is so often below the nominated and I want to be prepared to 
explain the window process.  With Jeff Fawcett and Julia White both gone, I 
guess I draw the lucky straw of explaining this.

Any info that you can forward in the next week or two would be appreciated.

i think that i can get you something.  how quickly do you need it?

Do you have any materials that describe SoCal's current windowing procedure?  

Thanks, Hedy:

Not good. John White has a similar view, i.e., Loretta doesn't have many 
choices given that the Legislature hasn't executed.  John did say, however, 
that if we can provide the legal analysis to support doing something other 
than "suspend," Loretta is likely to be amenable.  Seems like it would be 
useful to try to get the analysis, assuming that  there's legal analysis to 
support an alternative to "suspend."  

Hertzberg and I are trading calls.  Will report back as soon as I hear 
anything.

I spoke with Bill and gave him the background on the DA issue (Turn's
core/noncore, the green portfolio, etc) and asked him about some
possibilities - i.e. could Loretta delay action until after the
Legislature acts on SB18, and/or AB 82, etc.
He responded that Loretta likes the SB18 approach, which she sees as
cheaper and cleaner.  But she also is very loyal to the state and
believes the timing is dependent upon the Treasurer's assessment of the
need.  Right now Angelides accepts counsel's view that DA has to be
eliminated to market the bonds.  Loretta believes the only authority the
Commission has is when to suspend DA, not whether to suspend it.
Angelides is continuing to press her to eliminate it, but she had hoped
the Legislature would take action to give the Commission some
flexibility.  That hasn't happened.  Their view is that the language of
AB 1x needs to be changed legislatively, since their authority is so
limited.  He expects action in the near future, but doesn't know exactly
when.

FYI.  Story on the effect of FERC prices on supply in PNW.

Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western 
U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant 
developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be 
enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter. 
The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators - 
high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have 
cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts, 
about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western 
Montana.
"The price caps have added uncertainty," said Scott Simms, spokesman for 
Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. "If we look forward to 
this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we have 
concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of 
having rotating outages in the region." 
About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits 
on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a 
new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power 
plant. 
The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' 
needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of 
hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought. A turbine that size could 
power about 45,000 homes. 
"You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said. 
After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended 
negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was 
ready to build in time for winter. Both utilities - Tacoma Power and 
Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply 
shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market and 
had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%. 
But both utilities told NRG, and later Dow Jones Newswires, that they had no 
reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies, because the 
FERC had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot 
market. NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in 
Washington that could have added 300 megawatts. 
FERC's price controls, as well as supply-demand fundamentals, have 
dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the West's open 
market in the past few months. 
The current western U.S. electricity price cap of $98 a megawatt-hour covers 
the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking 
turbines, but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers. In 
addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower 
level. The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut in 
half since the cap was first formulated in June. 

Not Everyone Blames FERC 

The average monthly price for on-peak hours in the Northwest from August 
through March is $60 a megawatt-hour - a fraction of what it was three months 
ago. Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's 
price controls have kept prices artificially low. A smaller group thinks the 
market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants 
are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and 
consumers are conserving electricity. 
Jim Kemp, a senior executive for the Canadian utility TransAlta's (TA.TO) 
merchant power group, TransAlta (TA.TO), for example, doesn't attribute the 
cancellation of projects to price controls. 
"I see it as due to demand-side control and new units," Kemp said. "The 
market is sending out a signal that we have enough. Maybe this winter we will 
find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is 
sending now." 
The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two 
months. Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout 
the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for 
a few hours so far this summer. 
"Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started," said 
Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG. "The 
need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling." 
Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the 
winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze. 
Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in 
cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance. TransAlta is 
continuing construction of a 154-megawatt peaking plant in Washington, 
because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago. 
"The number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed 
within the time frame we're talking about," said Dick Watson, a director with 
the Northwest Power Planning Council. 
Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap. 
Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap "undercuts the Commission's 
efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity." 
As previously reported, some small oil-fired generators, which are even more 
expensive to operate than the permanent, gas-fired peaking plants, have even 
been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six 
months. And orders for new generators have been canceled.

Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western 
U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant 
developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be 
enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter. 
The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators - 
high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have 
cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts, 
about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western 
Montana.
"The price caps have added uncertainty," said Scott Simms, spokesman for 
Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. "If we look forward to 
this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we have 
concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of 
having rotating outages in the region." 
About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits 
on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a 
new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power 
plant. 
The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' 
needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of 
hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought. A turbine that size could 
power about 45,000 homes. 
"You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said. 
After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended 
negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was 
ready to build in time for winter. Both utilities - Tacoma Power and 
Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were 
involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock 
they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.
JEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have 
crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
"The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the 
law." 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing." 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated. 
"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns." 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
"I don't see a conflict," he said. "At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron." 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards," he wrote. "That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters." 
"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person." 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory 
services" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

Power-Market Bear Mauls Plans For New Generators In West
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The crumbling price of electricity in the western 
U.S., attributed by many to federal price controls, has forced power plant 
developers to cancel projects, calling into question whether there will be 
enough electricity to meet demand in the Northwest this winter. 
The cancellations of peaking plants and temporary, oil-fired generators - 
high-cost units that provide power needed only when demand is highest - have 
cut projected generating capacity in the Northwest by up to 1,000 megawatts, 
about 3% of the combined peak demand of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western 
Montana.
"The price caps have added uncertainty," said Scott Simms, spokesman for 
Enron Corp. (ENE) unit Portland General Electric Co. "If we look forward to 
this winter and you see a diminished supply scenario, you can see why we have 
concerns about regional reliability. That could put us in a position of 
having rotating outages in the region." 
About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits 
on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a 
new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power 
plant. 
The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' 
needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of 
hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought. A turbine that size could 
power about 45,000 homes. 
"You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said. 
After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended 
negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was 
ready to build in time for winter. Both utilities - Tacoma Power and 
Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply 
shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market and 
had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%. 
But both utilities told NRG, and later Dow Jones Newswires, that they had no 
reason to sign long-term contracts to guarantee new supplies, because the 
FERC had practically eliminated the financial risk of relying on the spot 
market. NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in 
Washington that could have added 300 megawatts. 
FERC's price controls, as well as supply-demand fundamentals, have 
dramatically changed the economics of selling power into the West's open 
market in the past few months. 
The current western U.S. electricity price cap of $98 a megawatt-hour covers 
the costs of generating power from easy-to-install but inefficient peaking 
turbines, but not the capital costs of buying and installing new peakers. In 
addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower 
level. The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut in 
half since the cap was first formulated in June. 

Not Everyone Blames FERC 

The average monthly price for on-peak hours in the Northwest from August 
through March is $60 a megawatt-hour - a fraction of what it was three months 
ago. Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's 
price controls have kept prices artificially low. A smaller group thinks the 
market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants 
are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and 
consumers are conserving electricity. 
Jim Kemp, a senior executive for the Canadian utility TransAlta's (TA.TO) 
merchant power group, TransAlta (TA.TO), for example, doesn't attribute the 
cancellation of projects to price controls. 
"I see it as due to demand-side control and new units," Kemp said. "The 
market is sending out a signal that we have enough. Maybe this winter we will 
find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is 
sending now." 
The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two 
months. Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout 
the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for 
a few hours so far this summer. 
"Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started," said 
Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG. "The 
need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling." 
Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the 
winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze. 
Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in 
cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance. TransAlta is 
continuing construction of a 154-megawatt peaking plant in Washington, 
because much of the plant's capacity was sold months ago. 
"The number of announced projects is far and away more than what is needed 
within the time frame we're talking about," said Dick Watson, a director with 
the Northwest Power Planning Council. 
Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap. 
Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap "undercuts the Commission's 
efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity." 
As previously reported, some small oil-fired generators, which are even more 
expensive to operate than the permanent, gas-fired peaking plants, have even 
been taken off line permanently after being installed over the past six 
months. And orders for new generators have been canceled.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 1, 2000
GOVERNOR DAVIS RESPONDS TO FERC WITH INITIATIVES ON ELECTRICITY PRICES,
SUPPLY
SACRAMENTO - Responding to a draft proposal by the Federal Energy Regulator=
y
Commission (FERC), Governor Gray Davis today announced several initiatives
to ensure reliable and affordable electricity in California.

In a letter to the federal regulators, the Governor outlined a variety of
regulatory and legislative actions to keep the state=01,s electricity price=
s at
the lowest reasonable cost. They include innovative measures to encourage
the siting of power plants in compliance with the state=01,s environmental
laws, restructuring the state=01,s power-buying agencies to eliminate confl=
icts
of interests, and promoting energy conservation and voluntary cutbacks by
larger users during periods of high electricity demand.

"If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale
markets, the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited
in scope," wrote Gov. Davis, who also reiterated his call to FERC to order
retroactive refunds to San Diego and Orange County consumers, and to impose
price caps on the price of wholesale electricity. "I cannot in good
conscience, however, forego any measure that would serve to protect the
people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale
markets will not victimize Californians again."

Governor Davis, who inherited the problems of deregulation as a result of
legislation signed by Governor Pete Wilson in 1996, said that "The free
market applied to electricity can work, but only if market conditions allow
for real competition, and if all parties act responsibly." The Governor
added "Even though FERC had recently concluded that California=01,s market =
was
=01+dysfunctional,=01, its draft proposal fails to include measures to stop
out-of-state electrical generators from price gouging, and would lead to
higher prices next summer."

The Governor=01,s proposals include:

Introducing legislation to dramatically change the membership of the ISO an=
d
PX, eliminating members of the board that have what he called "inherent
conflicts of interest" and replacing them with independent members;

Seeking legislation that will allow new approaches - such as emissions
credit trading - to aid in the siting of new power plants;

Calling on the state=01,s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to promote
distributed generation and co-generation;

Accelerating voluntary efforts by the private sector as well as state
agencies to reduce their energy use during peak periods;

Expanding "forward contracting" by utilities that would allow multi-year
contracts to reduce price volatility and ensure reliability;

Asking the PUC to expedite its investigation of the state=01,s electricity
demand reduction programs for commercial users, and adopt new programs to
allow voluntary interruptions that will allow the reduction of electricity
use during peak power periods;

Reviewing new measures to coordinate power-plant maintenance and operating
activities;

Requiring utilities to retain their existing generation facilities instead
of selling them off at least until the market becomes competitive; and

Calling on the PUC and California Energy Commission (CEC) to study providin=
g
"real time price signals" (such as metering) to large energy users to reduc=
e
energy use.

Governor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration, no
power plants were built in the state. But since April 1999, six power plant=
s
representing 4,700 MW of new generation have been approved. Twenty more
applications are under review and 11 more are in the pipeline.

"This represents a significant change in policy and performance and respond=
s
to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without
abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and
environmental protection," he said.

The Governor=01,s initiatives announced today reflects his commitment to FE=
RC
Chairman James Hoecker at a hearing last month in San Diego to provide inpu=
t
into FERC=01,s final order on the California electricity market. That decis=
ion
could come as early as December 13, 2000.

The Governor will continue to meet with legislative leaders, consumer
groups, and other interested parties to discuss additional options. He said
a more complete plan cannot be developed until FERC=01,s final order has be=
en
announced and analyzed.

literally JUST found out that the meeting's been cancelled.  so may work out 
just fine. let me get back to you in about 30 minutes.

best,
jeff

were you going, too?  i hadn't heard a damned thing.  steffes just informed 
me.

tons of fun.

Thanks Cynthia.  

Could you please try the W (since I know that one) and let me know as soon as 
possible?  Greatly appreciated.  

And I'll go ahead on the frequent flyer miles.  I'm assuming that the ticket 
you booked for me (is the one that leaves SF on 8/2 at 9:15 AM and returns 
from NYC on 8/5 at 4:15 EDT)?

Thanks again.

Jeff, please read carefully (from our travel agent in Houston):

Cynthia Biggs <cynthia.biggs@travelpark.com> on 07/30/2001 01:31:04 PM
Hello there. I have made reservations for Jeff. If he is wanting to use
frequent flyer mileage for the other ticket, the number to call is
800-421-4655 then press 4. I made those kind of reservations one time, and
the airline agent screwed them all up and ended up being the biggest
headache for me, so I don't touch them any more. Also, the waldorf towers
and waldorf astoria both are sold out for those days. Does he have a couple
of other choices? Enron's preferred hotels are: Drake, Hilton and Towers,
Intercontinental, Loews Metropolitan, Millennium Broadway, Millennium
Hilton, New York Palace, Penninsula, Plaza, St Regis, and W hotel. Let me
know if you want me to check any of those.

thanks
cynthia

Dandy.  Thanks so much.  What's the address of the W?

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  Bev just phoned.  Assuming all goes well---and it should----she'll back 
on her feet and working next Tuesday.

Best,
Jeff

thanks to you both very much for your help.

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were 
involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock 
they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have 
crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
"The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the 
law." 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing." 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated. 
"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns." 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
"I don't see a conflict," he said. "At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron." 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards," he wrote. "That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters." 
"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person." 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide "financial advisory services" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory 
services" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 1, 2000
GOVERNOR DAVIS RESPONDS TO FERC WITH INITIATIVES ON ELECTRICITY PRICES,
SUPPLY
SACRAMENTO - Responding to a draft proposal by the Federal Energy Regulator=
y
Commission (FERC), Governor Gray Davis today announced several initiatives
to ensure reliable and affordable electricity in California.

In a letter to the federal regulators, the Governor outlined a variety of
regulatory and legislative actions to keep the state=01,s electricity price=
s at
the lowest reasonable cost. They include innovative measures to encourage
the siting of power plants in compliance with the state=01,s environmental
laws, restructuring the state=01,s power-buying agencies to eliminate confl=
icts
of interests, and promoting energy conservation and voluntary cutbacks by
larger users during periods of high electricity demand.

"If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale
markets, the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited
in scope," wrote Gov. Davis, who also reiterated his call to FERC to order
retroactive refunds to San Diego and Orange County consumers, and to impose
price caps on the price of wholesale electricity. "I cannot in good
conscience, however, forego any measure that would serve to protect the
people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale
markets will not victimize Californians again."

Governor Davis, who inherited the problems of deregulation as a result of
legislation signed by Governor Pete Wilson in 1996, said that "The free
market applied to electricity can work, but only if market conditions allow
for real competition, and if all parties act responsibly." The Governor
added "Even though FERC had recently concluded that California=01,s market =
was
=01+dysfunctional,=01, its draft proposal fails to include measures to stop
out-of-state electrical generators from price gouging, and would lead to
higher prices next summer."

The Governor=01,s proposals include:

Introducing legislation to dramatically change the membership of the ISO an=
d
PX, eliminating members of the board that have what he called "inherent
conflicts of interest" and replacing them with independent members;

Seeking legislation that will allow new approaches - such as emissions
credit trading - to aid in the siting of new power plants;

Calling on the state=01,s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to promote
distributed generation and co-generation;

Accelerating voluntary efforts by the private sector as well as state
agencies to reduce their energy use during peak periods;

Expanding "forward contracting" by utilities that would allow multi-year
contracts to reduce price volatility and ensure reliability;

Asking the PUC to expedite its investigation of the state=01,s electricity
demand reduction programs for commercial users, and adopt new programs to
allow voluntary interruptions that will allow the reduction of electricity
use during peak power periods;

Reviewing new measures to coordinate power-plant maintenance and operating
activities;

Requiring utilities to retain their existing generation facilities instead
of selling them off at least until the market becomes competitive; and

Calling on the PUC and California Energy Commission (CEC) to study providin=
g
"real time price signals" (such as metering) to large energy users to reduc=
e
energy use.

Governor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration, no
power plants were built in the state. But since April 1999, six power plant=
s
representing 4,700 MW of new generation have been approved. Twenty more
applications are under review and 11 more are in the pipeline.

"This represents a significant change in policy and performance and respond=
s
to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without
abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and
environmental protection," he said.

The Governor=01,s initiatives announced today reflects his commitment to FE=
RC
Chairman James Hoecker at a hearing last month in San Diego to provide inpu=
t
into FERC=01,s final order on the California electricity market. That decis=
ion
could come as early as December 13, 2000.

The Governor will continue to meet with legislative leaders, consumer
groups, and other interested parties to discuss additional options. He said
a more complete plan cannot be developed until FERC=01,s final order has be=
en
announced and analyzed.

Greetings:

With California enjoying a brief respite from Legislative antics, we plan to 
cancel tomorrow's California call and will reconvene on Thursday.

However, if anyone has pressing matters or information they'd like to discuss 
tomorrow, we'll go ahead with the call.  Let me know.  

If I've missed anyone with this note, please forward along.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

we're always looking for new recruits, eh?

Folks,  since many law firms have failed to exit the dark ages, they continue 
to use wordperfect.  To open this, don't launch.  Instead, "detach."  Then 
open the file that you've "detached" and it should convert from WP to word 
and you should be able to open it.

Greetings.  Since I get everything that you forward, you may remove me from 
you distribution list.  Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Ms Dotty.  Hope you've managed to stay a night or two in your house 
recently.  Do you think that it would be OK to call your cousin in Sea 
Ranch?  I have some carpentry work I'd like done on my property (panel 
interior of cabin; build deck and gazebo) and thought I might get him, or 
someone who works for/with him, or someone he could recommend to help me 
out.  If you think he wouldn't mind having me call, might you have his phone 
number (and full name)?  As always, greatly appreciated.

FYI:  Just talked to the guy from UC Davis who's in the field for Mendocino 
County.  He says that by the sound of it, my property just might end up being 
vine-friendly!

All the best,
Jeff

Well sometime between 11 PM last night and this morning, my computer died.  
However, I will nonetheless get a draft of the letter out today for 
discussion on tomorrow's call.  Given the glitch, it will likely be out by 
COB today.  Apologies for the delay.

Best,
Jeff

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 1, 2000
GOVERNOR DAVIS RESPONDS TO FERC WITH INITIATIVES ON ELECTRICITY PRICES,
SUPPLY
SACRAMENTO - Responding to a draft proposal by the Federal Energy Regulator=
y
Commission (FERC), Governor Gray Davis today announced several initiatives
to ensure reliable and affordable electricity in California.

In a letter to the federal regulators, the Governor outlined a variety of
regulatory and legislative actions to keep the state=01,s electricity price=
s at
the lowest reasonable cost. They include innovative measures to encourage
the siting of power plants in compliance with the state=01,s environmental
laws, restructuring the state=01,s power-buying agencies to eliminate confl=
icts
of interests, and promoting energy conservation and voluntary cutbacks by
larger users during periods of high electricity demand.

"If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale
markets, the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited
in scope," wrote Gov. Davis, who also reiterated his call to FERC to order
retroactive refunds to San Diego and Orange County consumers, and to impose
price caps on the price of wholesale electricity. "I cannot in good
conscience, however, forego any measure that would serve to protect the
people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale
markets will not victimize Californians again."

Governor Davis, who inherited the problems of deregulation as a result of
legislation signed by Governor Pete Wilson in 1996, said that "The free
market applied to electricity can work, but only if market conditions allow
for real competition, and if all parties act responsibly." The Governor
added "Even though FERC had recently concluded that California=01,s market =
was
=01+dysfunctional,=01, its draft proposal fails to include measures to stop
out-of-state electrical generators from price gouging, and would lead to
higher prices next summer."

The Governor=01,s proposals include:

Introducing legislation to dramatically change the membership of the ISO an=
d
PX, eliminating members of the board that have what he called "inherent
conflicts of interest" and replacing them with independent members;

Seeking legislation that will allow new approaches - such as emissions
credit trading - to aid in the siting of new power plants;

Calling on the state=01,s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to promote
distributed generation and co-generation;

Accelerating voluntary efforts by the private sector as well as state
agencies to reduce their energy use during peak periods;

Expanding "forward contracting" by utilities that would allow multi-year
contracts to reduce price volatility and ensure reliability;

Asking the PUC to expedite its investigation of the state=01,s electricity
demand reduction programs for commercial users, and adopt new programs to
allow voluntary interruptions that will allow the reduction of electricity
use during peak power periods;

Reviewing new measures to coordinate power-plant maintenance and operating
activities;

Requiring utilities to retain their existing generation facilities instead
of selling them off at least until the market becomes competitive; and

Calling on the PUC and California Energy Commission (CEC) to study providin=
g
"real time price signals" (such as metering) to large energy users to reduc=
e
energy use.

Governor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration, no
power plants were built in the state. But since April 1999, six power plant=
s
representing 4,700 MW of new generation have been approved. Twenty more
applications are under review and 11 more are in the pipeline.

"This represents a significant change in policy and performance and respond=
s
to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without
abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and
environmental protection," he said.

The Governor=01,s initiatives announced today reflects his commitment to FE=
RC
Chairman James Hoecker at a hearing last month in San Diego to provide inpu=
t
into FERC=01,s final order on the California electricity market. That decis=
ion
could come as early as December 13, 2000.

The Governor will continue to meet with legislative leaders, consumer
groups, and other interested parties to discuss additional options. He said
a more complete plan cannot be developed until FERC=01,s final order has be=
en
announced and analyzed.

FYI.  This is THE story out here today.  Given the repugnant things that 
Maviglio has said about Enron over the past several months, it will be very 
interesting to see whether he'll be able to withstand the fact that all the 
time that he was saying those things, he owned our stock.  Gee, couldn't 
happen to a nicer guy.

Best,
Jeff

In addition, all this buzz about conflicts with traders and Calpine could put 
in jeopardy the state's contracts with Calpine, which may, in the end, be a 
very good thing for Direct Access.
Davis spokesman under fire for stock 
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 31, 2001) 
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he 
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was 
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power 
plant. 
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state 
power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that 
Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private 
finances and their public roles. 
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the 
administration, said he put in an "open" order for Calpine stock May 31, 
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. 
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices 
across the board." 
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and 
it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he 
had no control over the exact date of purchase. 
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a 
story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply 
responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. 
"They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future," 
Maviglio said at the time. "Their pricing has been far more reasonable than 
any other generator." 
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based 
generators. He said Calpine "took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the 
world," an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with 
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. 
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the 
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who 
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent 
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and 
potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. 
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. 
"These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should 
roll," he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the 
probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff." 
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while 
possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the 
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal 
prosecution. 
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the 
prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from 
profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. 
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. 
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by 
insider-trading crackdowns. 
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for 
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, 
after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced 
he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support 
construction. 
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as 
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. 
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to 
build the plant. 
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the 
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which 
he purchased in 1996. 
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this 
was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public 
knowledge," he said. "I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's 
going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something 
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at 
all." 
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have 
used inside information to make his stock purchase. 
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually 
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been 
unrelated," Maviglio said. "There was no timing-based sequence to it." 
Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in 
recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy 
crisis. 
The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on 
May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was 
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at 
$39.85. 
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a 
price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' 
profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. 
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy 
traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said 
administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible 
violations of the law or close to it." 
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday. "The difference 
with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're 
committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power." 
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the 
Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy 
for the state. 
"Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill 
statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they 
should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been 
hired," Knox said.

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants 
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001) 
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power 
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say. 
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a 
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between 
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state. 
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't 
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on 
the governing board of the Independent System Operator. 
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a 
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in 
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers. 
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped 
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some 
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't. 
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of 
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR. 
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves 
confidential bidding behavior. 
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the 
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his 
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined. 
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose 
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said. 
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's 
not necessarily a good fit." 
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines. 
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing 
output when demand doesn't match forecasts. 
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a 
process the industry calls "decking." 
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly 
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the 
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20 
a megawatt-hour. 
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660 
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the 
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee. 
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant 
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of 
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said. 
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarming 
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less 
than it paid, he said. 
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business 
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather. 
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for 
no good reason," Florio said. 
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas 
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because 
they're contracted with DWR," he said. 
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also 
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said. 
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on 
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO 
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting 
costs, Florio said. 
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical 
decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie 
McCorkle. 
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on 
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a 
smoother-running system in place by next summer.

Gouger Gray Davis 
California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not." 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power 
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators 
who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies.

Thanks.  Looks like one thing good has happened for them today.  I don't 
think Maviglio will be able to stay.  Your thoughts?  I'm glad he made some 
money off of Enron stock.  (What a jerk.)

Also, we did file the amended complaint yesterday and the motion to quash

Jeff,

Following up on yesterday's conversation, SBX1 31 did contain some expedited
review provisions for CPUC and DWR decisions and was chaptered into law on
May 10.  The first special session ended on or about May 15 which means the
expedited provisions take effect on or about August 15.  The intent of the
budget language was to have that take effect even sooner.

Scott

You're a doll.  Thanks.  Hope to talk to you soon.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Sue:

I hope the packing and other move-related things are going well---I know that 
something invariably happens that creates havoc.  Good luck.

I haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on, so I thought 
I'd give you a quick update:

Scott and Bowen and I talked re: getting authority for EBS to dig dirt and 
install some facilities in California.  With some effort, we persuaded Scott 
that having dinner with Loretta Lynch, well, wasn't going to do get the job 
done (though Scott's not yet completely convinced).  Instead, Scott's going 
to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the 
project entails.  Once we've got that, we can meet with Commission staff and 
take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump 
through in order to get authority to do the project, and what the time frame 
for approval would look like.  Scott agrees with this approach.  He's going 
to try to get more info from the network folks in Portland.  We likely will 
regroup to figure out "next steps" right after the first of the year.  Have 
any thoughts on this approach?
I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings.  However, this 
Thursday is my girlfriend's birthday, and her parents (who live in the area) 
have had a little "special  event" planned for the past 6 months.  
Consequently, I will have to miss the GA Xmas party, which I'm very 
disappointed about----I really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with 
everyone.  I'll also therefore have to participate in Thursday's call by 
phone.  Apologies, but I'm sticking to the tried and true rule:  "Family and 
relationships first!"

Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants=
=20
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001)=20
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power=20
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say.=
=20
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a=20
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown betwe=
en=20
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state.=20
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't=
=20
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits =
on=20
the governing board of the Independent System Operator.=20
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a=
=20
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in=
=20
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers.=20
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January steppe=
d=20
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some=
=20
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't.=20
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of=
=20
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR.=
=20
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves=
=20
confidential bidding behavior.=20
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the=20
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his=
=20
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined.=20
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose=20
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said.=20
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's=
=20
not necessarily a good fit."=20
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission line=
s.=20
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing=
=20
output when demand doesn't match forecasts.=20
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a=
=20
process the industry calls "decking."=20
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly=20
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the=
=20
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $=
20=20
a megawatt-hour.=20
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660=
=20
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the=20
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee.=20
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one pla=
nt=20
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of=20
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said.=20
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarmi=
ng=20
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for le=
ss=20
than it paid, he said.=20
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business=
=20
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather.=20
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred f=
or=20
no good reason," Florio said.=20
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas=20
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because=
=20
they're contracted with DWR," he said.=20
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also=
=20
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said.=20
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on=
=20
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO=
=20
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting=
=20
costs, Florio said.=20
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical=
=20
decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie=
=20
McCorkle.=20
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on=20
bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a=20
smoother-running system in place by next summer.=20

Davis: FERC excluding $5 billion of owed refunds=20

Although the commission's order suggested that California is owed refunds=

order's fine print placed severe limits on such refunds, Davis said.=20
"FERC is up to its old tricks again," he said. "They talk about refunds for=

Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, declined comment Monday and said th=

But after poring over details of the 40-page order, state officials said=20
Monday that it excludes from consideration more than half the amount sought=

Attorney Barry Goode and Nancy McFadden, key members of Davis' energy team,=

For electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources from=20
private companies this year. The state says it is owed about $3 billion fro=

The FERC ruling means that only DWR's purchases through the state's=20
now-defunct Power Exchange or through the operator of a statewide electrici=

Such limitations by the regulatory agency are impractical because the marke=

electricity for debt-strapped private utilities in January, Goode said.=20
"Now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they=20

those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to =

The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio=
n=20
debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa=
n=20
Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20
selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is=
=20
that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20
SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20
actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher=
=20
price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t=
o=20
over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E=20
earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while=
=20
publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham=
es=20
said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20
detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state=
=20
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20
SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20
consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the compa=
ny=20
had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was=
=20
required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20
marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "Wh=
at=20
we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20
along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20
publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the=
=20
Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,=
=20
SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates=
=20
during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal=
=20
terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici=
ty=20
to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold=
=20
that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20
pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr=
om=20
the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and=
=20
billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici=
ty=20
exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,=
=20
it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20
million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with=
=20

City officials are expecting to get their first look today at long-awaited=

plans to build the largest power plant in North County since the Encina pla=

Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is ver=

before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in=
=20
the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in=20
partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The Californ=

Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take=

three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the=20
industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the=

idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power=20
plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and=

the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest=

THE STATE
Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power=
=20
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.
By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

July 31 2001

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry=
=20
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat=
e,=20
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.

The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants=
=20
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20
information not available to the public.

On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be=
en=20
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a=
nd=20
their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20
capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20
about who in the administration owns energy stocks.

Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company=
=20
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California h=
as=20
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20
Enron Corp. in 1996.

"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.

He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's=
=20
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th=
e=20
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio=
n=20
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a=
=20
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.

"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he=
=20
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available=
=20
information.

The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms=
=20
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy=
=20
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from=
=20
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held=
=20
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of=
=20
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte=
r=20
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were=
=20
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20
failed to do so.

In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said=
=20
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and=
=20
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20
crisis.

In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur=
e=20
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two=
=20
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20
possibility of insider trading.

State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the=
ir=20
personal financial interests.

The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,=
=20
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not=
=20
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the=
=20
agency's review would result in any charges.

Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by=
=20
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider=
=20
trading.

But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his=
=20
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende=
d=20
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow=
er=20
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders=
=20
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to =
be=20
filed only two weeks ago.

"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,=
=20
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a=20
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."

Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two=
=20
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just befor=
e=20
leaving her state job.

Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock i=
n=20
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the sto=
ck=20
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a=
=20
good investment.

"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.=
=20
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."

As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20
state, but only at market prices.

Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hi=
s=20
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,=
=20
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court=
=20
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.

Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said=
=20
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for=
=20
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.=
=20
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor=
,=20
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20
consulting business with the governor."

As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20
Monday morning.

Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathle=
en=20
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becaus=
e=20
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for=20
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fro=
m=20
Davis and the Legislature.

Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with=
=20
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the=
=20
outcome of the lawsuit.

Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a mon=
th=20
for six months.

Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

PG&E Corp. said yesterday that it will earn $500 million to $600 million mo=

than anticipated in the second quarter because its bankrupt utility was abl=

to buy cheaper electricity in March as wholesale prices dropped.=20
As a consequence, PG&E reduced the amount of money it says the utility,=20

$5.2 billion to between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion.=20
"Its a good thing for PG&E," said Paul Fremont, an energy industry analyst=

Thomson Financial/First Call, an investment research firm.=20
PG&E Corp. is the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which filed for=20
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after electricity prices soared=

this year. The utility had previously estimated that it lost $1.1 billion i=

PG&E Corp. also includes a energy producing unit, which generally makes=20

the utility's bankruptcy.=20
The utility said it got a small break in March as the price it was paying t=

the California Independent System Operator for energy declined sharply. The=

unanticipated drop was attributed to declining demand because of energy=20
conservation, low tempera-=20
tures and the opening of new power plants in the state.=20
The utility also benefited from the cancellation of power contracts by=20
companies that did not want to do business with a bankrupt partner. Those=

GOV. GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the=20
hiring of outsiders to help manage California's energy crisis.=20
Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to=20
questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big=
=20
checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts.=
=20
As of yesterday, the governor's office still has not required 16 contractor=
s=20
to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any=
=20
financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop.=20
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said 42 energy "consultants=
"=20
have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16=
=20
were "contractors" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were=
=20
thus not required to fill out the forms.=20
Maviglio's "contractor versus consultant" distinctions are technical and=20
semantic. His spin simply doesn't wash.=20
The bottom line is that "contractors" who are making big decisions involvin=
g=20
big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in th=
e=20
public trust.=20
For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera=
=20
and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a=
=20
$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advic=
e.=20
Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would=
=20
allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a=20
potential conflict exists.=20
"They told us they don't have any conflicts," said Maviglio, who,=20
incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of=
=20
stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk o=
f=20
state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as "the mo=
st=20
responsible of the generators."=20
Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire=
=20
five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly=
=20
filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts. A sixth consulta=
nt=20
quit. Four of those traders owned Calpine shares.=20
A week earlier, the Davis administration was forced to order a group of=20
consultants to hastily unload their power-company holdings or lose their=20
contracts.=20
The governor's office also has been stung by revelations that political=20
consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, hired at $30,000 a month to=20
develop energy-related "communications strategies," also had a contract wit=
h=20
Southern California Edison.=20
Moreover, some of the disclosure forms that have been filed to date have be=
en=20
less than complete, especially regarding the timing of the buying and selli=
ng=20
of energy stocks.=20
How many scandals will it take for Davis to insist on full disclosure -- an=

San Francisco -- After decades of trying to persuade San Francisco to take=

.=20
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy. It's the depletion of the state=

The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot measure=

that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacif=
ic=20

On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit=

optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th=

out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha=

been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th=

amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee=
n=20
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's=
=20
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug=
e=20
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the=20
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the=
=20
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required=20
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."=
=20
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urgin=
g=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and=

the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked=

for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,=
=20
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.=20
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20

generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping=
=20
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33=
0=20
per megawatt hour.=20
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators=

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For the past seven months, Gov. Gray Davis has begged=
,=20
cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo=
rk=20
for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin=
g=20
its lights on.=20
Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti=
ve=20
investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20
battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc=
e=20
back from a rocky start.=20
This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20
scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which=
=20
would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed=
,=20
Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political=
=20
infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t=
o=20
satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti=
er=20
investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20
without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial=
=20
headaches for decades to come.=20
"This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr.=20
Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging."=
=20
That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and=
=20
credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb=
t=20
investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a=
s=20
long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers=
=20
from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.=
=20
Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will=
=20
be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20
private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20
Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20
succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20
originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy=
=20
crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th=
e=20
price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summ=
er=20
in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rollin=
g=20
blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year.=20
Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies=
=20
are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance=20
disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System=
=20
and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor=
s=20
Service and Standard & Poor's assigned investment-grade ratings as recently=
=20
as early January to debt issued by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., just three=

months before the California utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court=20
protection.=20
By the time California hopes to sell its bonds, in October or early Novembe=
r,=20
the state's electrical-power purchases are expected to leave it owing a tot=
al=20
of about $10 billion to its lenders and its own general fund. If the bond=

issue is delayed beyond that, or canceled, or if the offering flops,=20
California could be forced to make billions of dollars in spending cuts,=20
raise taxes or increase electricity rates for the third time in the past ye=
ar=20
to pay back what it owes.=20
If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble,"=
=20
says Mr. Angelides. "The state general fund must be repaid so money for=20
education, health care and children's services can be safe."=20
California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --=
=20
stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,=
=20
the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow=
er=20
plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore=
d=20
power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20
The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20
soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.=
=20
Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from =
$7=20
billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20
billion.=20
With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and=
=20
Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20
dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business=
=20
with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow=
ed=20
the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from=
=20
public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, =
at=20
a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20
In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a=
=20
bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20
continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size=
=20
of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula=
=20
would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20
Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20
another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to=
=20
$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake=
rs=20
banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to=
=20
immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20
mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20
In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving=
=20
four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine=
d=20
a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi=
ng=20
moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.=
=20
At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny dow=
n"=20
their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin=
g=20
a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou=
p=20
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t=
o=20
charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20
issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $=
56=20
million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees=
=20
won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20
structure.=20
From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem=
ed=20
fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to=
=20
explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h=
is=20
blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi=
s=20
only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's=
=20
Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes=
=20
before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th=
e=20
state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20
During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20
conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20
director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not=
=20
getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present.=20
"It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, =
a=20
Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't=
=20
recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A=
=20
spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20
Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20
investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike=
=20
system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.=
=20
But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20
Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers=
,=20
turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response=
=20
to one of his answers.=20
Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f=
or=20
example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20
Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless=
=20
it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by=
=20
February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20
claims "completely" political.=20
California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger=
=20
pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,=
=20
"and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors=
=20
know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby=
=20
added.=20
Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the=
=20
Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20
former Prudential Securities investment banker has spent hours on conferenc=
e=20
calls with Wall Street explaining the state's strategy. That and a sense th=
at=20
California has gotten a better grip on its electricity woes indicates that=
=20
"the governor's staff is far higher on the learning curve than just a few=
=20
months ago," says Paul Patterson, an electric-power analyst at ABN Amro Inc=
.=20
Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t=
o=20
make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue=
=20
set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,=
=20
the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20
purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20
raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20
decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20
utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20
consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice=
=20
directly from generators or traders.=20
But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh=
t.=20
Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might=
=20
get carte blanche to raise rates and are threatening to sue to block the PU=
C=20
decision before the state Supreme Court.=20
California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.=
=20
Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p=
er=20
kilowatt hour for power, up from about 10 cents in December. That compares=
=20
with around seven cents per kilowatt hour in Atlanta and 10 cents in Chicag=
o,=20
but it is still lower than the nearly 23 cents charged in New York City.=20
High costs are a big reason businesses think they ought to be free to buy=

s=20
Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20
The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr=
a=20
Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest=
=20
possible share of the revenues they collect from ratepayers. PG&E, for=20
example, has already asked for a public hearing to examine the state's clai=
m=20
that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20
utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai=
ls=20
and the utility joins PG&E in bankruptcy proceedings.=20
Sorting all these issues out before the PUC may lead to legal challenges th=

another nagging concern: Under a $43 billion series of long-term power=20
contracts signed by the state, electricity generators and traders involved=

get first call on revenue from ratepayers. Only then would bondholders, who=

are accustomed to being first in line, get paid.=20
In fact, some investors who were initially enthusiastic about a bond that i=

of=20
Envision Capital in Los Angeles, a firm that manages bond portfolios for=20
individual investors, says she spent several months setting aside money to=

participate in the deal. Now, she says, she is starting to look elsewhere. =
"I=20

Many investors are concerned the state hasn't proved it can overcome its=20

says Kelly Mainelli, a portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management in=
=20
San Francisco, who is considering investing in the bonds. He says he also=
=20
worries about a spike in natural gas prices ahead of the offering.=20
To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20
billion reserve -- from bond proceeds and ratepayer revenues -- to ensure=
=20
that bondholders would get paid in the event of any unforeseen developments=
=20
in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20
through the Legislature that would set aside a specific portion of revenues=

The five-to-20-year power contracts signed in a panic by the Davis=20

costs" that will burden our economy and state budget for years to come.=20
Now, Gov. Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billio=
n=20
long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating=20
energy market. Here's the real story:=20
Last summer, under a flawed deregulation, a handful of large out-of-state=
=20
generators effectively cornered California 's wholesale electricity market.=
=20
This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry. In November=
,=20
it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administrati=
on=20
gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energ=
y=20
purchases. Between November and July, the department burned through $8=20
billion in short-term energy purchases, devouring almost the entire state=
=20
budget surplus. This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass=
=20
the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to=
=20
issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt.=20
In February, with spot market prices at all-time highs and rolling blackout=
s=20
rippling through the state, the governor's representatives began to negotia=
te=20
long-term contracts with the sellers cartel. This was an ill-advised=20
long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis. To understand why, look at=
=20
the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective. The=
=20
cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a hug=
e=20
glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under=20
construction in California and throughout the West. Once the new energy=20
resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate=
=20
the market. This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of=
=20
three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in=
=20
the long-term energy contracts.=20
To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losse=
s.=20
Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their=20
redemption. The Davis administration walked into this market inferno,=20
bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contract=
s=20
that were too expensive. The administration also capitulated on two highly=
=20
objectionable clauses. The first requires the state to absorb all costs of=
=20
environmental protection for many of the generators. The second holds the=
=20
generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators b=
y=20
the state. This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over=
=20
the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab.=20
Notwithstanding the administration's spin, the current improvement in our=
=20
energy situation may be traced to at least four other factors: This summer=
=20
has been unusually cool, Californians have increased their conservation,=20
recessionary forces have reduced demand and, most important, the Federal=20
Energy Regulatory Commission finally imposed price caps on the sellers=20
cartel, dampening market manipulation.=20
The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California=
=20
still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity=
=20
costs and high bond debt. These higher costs will hurt consumers and=20
businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit th=

state's economic growth.=20
There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake. The first is t=

Electrical Switch: Now, Cheaper Power
Is Causing Hefty Losses for California=20
By Rebecca Smith

07/31/2001=20
The Wall Street Journal=20

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20
Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means=
=20
that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost=
=20
of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20
Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20
equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20
contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile=
=20
and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe=
r,=20
and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric=
e=20
it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio=
n=20
to $35 million.=20
The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,=
=20
the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20
electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing=
=20
business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned=
=20
utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since=
=20
then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much =
as=20
20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it=
=20
was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20
Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month=
=20
of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you=
'd=20
expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"=
=20
said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20
Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on=
=20
average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for=
=20
some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an=
d=20
$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas=
ed=20
under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20
excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27=
=20
per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t=
he=20
DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20
This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat=
e=20
was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at=
=20
times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly=
=20
power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20
obligations.=20
Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow=
n=20
substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 =
by=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20
factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International=
,=20
sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting=
=20
energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20
Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average=
=20
cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i=
s=20
more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices=
=20
averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen=
cy=20
$1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the=
=20
huge shortfall, the state has tapped California 's general fund and now is=
=20
pursuing a plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of revenue bonds to replenish i=
ts=20
coffers.=20
The state signed dozens of long-term power contracts after January, pushed =
by=20
federal energy regulators to protect itself against spot-market volatility.=
=20
So far this year, it has spent $851 million under long-term contracts, $2.3=

Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants=
=20
has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 31, 2001)=20
California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power=20
plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say.=
=20
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a=20
potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown betwe=
en=20
two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state.=20
"We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't=
=20
seem to be getting better," said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits =
on=20
the governing board of the Independent System Operator.=20
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a=
=20
deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in=
=20
theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers.=20
Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January steppe=
d=20
in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some=
=20
auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't.=20
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of=
=20
the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR.=
=20
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves=
=20
confidential bidding behavior.=20
But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the=20
Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his=
=20
agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined.=20
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose=20
credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said.=20
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said. "It's=
=20
not necessarily a good fit."=20
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission line=
s.=20
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing=
=20
output when demand doesn't match forecasts.=20
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a=
=20
process the industry calls "decking."=20
But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly=20
throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the=
=20
cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $=
20=20
a megawatt-hour.=20
Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660=
=20
megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the=20
ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee.=20
The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one pla=
nt=20
if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of=20
Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said.=20
The amount sounds like "small potatoes," but in some ways it is more alarmi=
ng=20
than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for le=
ss=20
than it paid, he said.=20
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business=
=20
where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather.=20
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred f=
or=20
no good reason," Florio said.=20
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas=20
plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because=
=20
they're contracted with DWR," he said.=20
Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also=
=20
been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said.=20
In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on=
=20
transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO=
=20
instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting=

costs, Florio said.=20
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical=

Davis: FERC excluding $5 billion of owed refunds=20

A ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week could cost=

Californians $5 billion in energy refunds, according to Gov. Gray Davis, wh=

Although the commission's order suggested that California is owed refunds=

order's fine print placed severe limits on such refunds, Davis said.=20
"FERC is up to its old tricks again," he said. "They talk about refunds for=

Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, declined comment Monday and said th=

California is seeking $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity=

But after poring over details of the 40-page order, state officials said=20
Monday that it excludes from consideration more than half the amount sought=

Attorney Barry Goode and Nancy McFadden, key members of Davis' energy team,=

For about $2 billion in alleged overcharges stemming from electricity=20

For electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources from=20
private companies this year. The state says it is owed about $3 billion fro=

The FERC ruling means that only DWR's purchases through the state's=20
now-defunct Power Exchange or through the operator of a statewide electrici=

Such limitations by the regulatory agency are impractical because the marke=

electricity for debt-strapped private utilities in January, Goode said.=20
"Now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they=20

those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to =

The company's effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio=
n=20
debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers' Action Network. The Sa=
n=20
Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E's claimed debt is the result of=20
selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is=
=20
that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20
SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20
actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher=
=20
price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t=
o=20
over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E=20
earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while=
=20
publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham=
es=20
said much of the information leading to UCAN's conclusion came from a=20
detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state=
=20
Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20
SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20
consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the compa=
ny=20
had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was=
=20
required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20
marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "Wh=
at=20
we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20
along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20
publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the=
=20
Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,=
=20
SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates=
=20
during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal=
=20
terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici=
ty=20
to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold=
=20
that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20
pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr=
om=20
the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and=
=20
billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E's costs to buy electrici=
ty=20
exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,=
=20
it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20
million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with=
=20
its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because=
=20
the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company's=20
shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses=
=20
entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities=
=20
Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June,=
=20
when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E's contractual=20
power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the=

because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says=

City officials are expecting to get their first look today at long-awaited=

plans to build the largest power plant in North County since the Encina pla=

came on line more than 30 years ago.  Sempra Energy Resources will file a=

200-page application with the city Planning Department for a 550-megawatt,=

natural gas-fired power plant and roughly 100-acre business park in southwe=

Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is ver=
y=20
detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort=20
before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in=
=20
the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in=20
partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The Californ=
ia=20
Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take=
=20
three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the=20
industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra's bid ever since the=
=20
idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power=20
plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and=
=20
the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest=
=20
median income in North County.  "I'm awaiting with great anticipation to se=

what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with=

would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state. The compa=

also has said the plant would not have a tall smokestack, or a visible vapo=

THE STATE
Davis' Energy Advisors Draw SEC Attention
Probe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power=
=20
company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.
By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEY
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

July 31 2001

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry=
=20
into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20
information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat=
e,=20
a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.

The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20
response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20
Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants=
=20
may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20
information not available to the public.

On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be=
en=20
fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a=
nd=20
their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20
capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20
about who in the administration owns energy stocks.

Financial disclosure records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve=20
Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company=
=20
he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California h=
as=20
been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20
Enron Corp. in 1996.

"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.

He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20
largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose's=
=20
mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th=
e=20
governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio's purchase, the transactio=
n=20
was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a=
=20
value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value.

"I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he=
=20
purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available=
=20
information.

The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms=
=20
that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20
California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy=
=20
merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.

The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from=
=20
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.

Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20
Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held=
=20
between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of=
=20
multimillion-dollar price gouging.

In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month afte=
r=20
he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were=
=20
supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20
failed to do so.

In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20
governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.

"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20
conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20
activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said=
=20
Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.

Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the=20
governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and=
=20
broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20
crisis.

In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur=
e=20
documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two=
=20
energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20
possibility of insider trading.

State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the=
ir=20
personal financial interests.

The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,=
=20
delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not=
=20
clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the=
=20
agency's review would result in any charges.

Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by=
=20
federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider=
=20
trading.

But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his=
=20
colleagues owned Calpine stock.

Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende=
d=20
it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20
now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20
traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.

Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20
March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow=
er=20
for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders=
=20
Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20
their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to =
be=20
filed only two weeks ago.

"But I'm sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,=
=20
because that's when we discussed it," Mead said. "It was kind of like a=20
hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate."

Former trader Elaine Griffin, who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two=
=20
weeks ago to take another job, said she didn't know she owned energy=20
securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13, just befor=
e=20
leaving her state job.

Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of Calpine stock i=
n=20
individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor, who bought the sto=
ck=20
Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after research found it to be a=
=20
good investment.

"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.=
=20
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked."

As a trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the=20
state, but only at market prices.

Meanwhile, two Democratic political consultants, who helped Davis polish hi=
s=20
image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet,=
=20
have agreed to accept no payment for their work as part of an out-of-court=
=20
settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit.

Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler, said=
=20
the settlement was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for=
=20
communications consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.

"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk. "Very simply Mr.=
=20
Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor=
,=20
to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the=20
consulting business with the governor."

As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler withdrew his lawsuit=20
Monday morning.

Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathle=
en=20
Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments becaus=
e=20
of a conflict of interest. The two men also did consulting work for=20
financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help fro=
m=20
Davis and the Legislature.

Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with=
=20
Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the=
=20
outcome of the lawsuit.

Under an agreement with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a mon=
th=20
for six months.

Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for comment.

PG&E Corp. said yesterday that it will earn $500 million to $600 million mo=

than anticipated in the second quarter because its bankrupt utility was abl=

to buy cheaper electricity in March as wholesale prices dropped.=20
As a consequence, PG&E reduced the amount of money it says the utility,=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., lost during California's energy crisis from=

$5.2 billion to between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion.=20
"Its a good thing for PG&E," said Paul Fremont, an energy industry analyst=

The disclosure by PG&E Corp. yesterday adds a modest boost to its quarterly=

an operating profit of 71 cents per share, according to analysts polled by=

Thomson Financial/First Call, an investment research firm.=20
PG&E Corp. is the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which filed for=20
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after electricity prices soared=
=20
this year. The utility had previously estimated that it lost $1.1 billion i=
n=20
the first quarter and $4.1 billion in the fourth because it was prohibited =
by=20
the state Public Utilities Commission from passing higher costs on to=20
consumers.=20
PG&E Corp. also includes a energy producing unit, which generally makes=20
money, and a venture capital arm. Neither of those divisions is affected by=
=20
the utility's bankruptcy.=20
The utility said it got a small break in March as the price it was paying t=

the California Independent System Operator for energy declined sharply. The=
=20
unanticipated drop was attributed to declining demand because of energy=20
conservation, low tempera-=20
tures and the opening of new power plants in the state.=20
The utility also benefited from the cancellation of power contracts by=20
companies that did not want to do business with a bankrupt partner. Those=

contracts were for selling power at below cost.=20

GOV. GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the=20
hiring of outsiders to help manage California's energy crisis.=20
Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to=20
questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big=
=20
checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts.=
=20
As of yesterday, the governor's office still has not required 16 contractor=
s=20
to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any=
=20
financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop.=20
Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said 42 energy "consultants=
"=20
have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16=
=20
were "contractors" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were=
=20
thus not required to fill out the forms.=20
Maviglio's "contractor versus consultant" distinctions are technical and=20
semantic. His spin simply doesn't wash.=20
The bottom line is that "contractors" who are making big decisions involvin=
g=20
big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in th=
e=20
public trust.=20
For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera=
=20
and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a=
=20
$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advic=
e.=20
Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would=
=20
allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a=20
potential conflict exists.=20
"They told us they don't have any conflicts," said Maviglio, who,=20
incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of=
=20
stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk o=
f=20
state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as "the mo=
st=20
responsible of the generators."=20
Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire=
=20
five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly=
=20
filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts. A sixth consulta=
nt=20
quit. Four of those traders owned Calpine shares.=20
A week earlier, the Davis administration was forced to order a group of=20
consultants to hastily unload their power-company holdings or lose their=20
contracts.=20
The governor's office also has been stung by revelations that political=20
consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, hired at $30,000 a month to=20
develop energy-related "communications strategies," also had a contract wit=
h=20
Southern California Edison.=20
Moreover, some of the disclosure forms that have been filed to date have be=
en=20
less than complete, especially regarding the timing of the buying and selli=
ng=20
of energy stocks.=20
How many scandals will it take for Davis to insist on full disclosure -- an=

San Francisco -- After decades of trying to persuade San Francisco to take=
=20
control of its electrical system, advocates of public power now have the=20
issue before city voters.=20
"The timing couldn't be better," said consumer advocate Medea Benjamin, co-=
=20
director of San Francisco's Global Exchange.=20
"It's not just the threat of blackouts or the highest rate hikes in history=
.=20
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy. It's the depletion of the state=
=20
budget," she said. "This is a hell of an opportunity."=20
The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot measure=
s=20
that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacif=
ic=20
Gas and Electric Co. out of the city's electricity market.=20
Under the proposed measures, an elected board of directors would set the=20
rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricit=
y=20
to whether to use more renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroelectri=
c=20
and solar power.=20
Public power would base policies "on a more localized basis, where the valu=
es=20
of an individual community can be put into practice," said Ed Smeloff, a=20
longtime public power advocate who was recently hired as an assistant gener=
al=20
manager at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.=20
One proposal, an initiative placed on the ballot by residents, calls for=20
setting up a municipal utility district in San Francisco and neighboring=20
Brisbane. The district would be governed by an elected board of directors.=
=20
The other measure, placed on the ballot last week by the Board of=20
Supervisors, would create a municipal water and power agency and would affe=
ct=20
only San Francisco.=20
PG&E has mounted a campaign to defeat the measures, so far pumping more tha=
n=20
$200,000 into the effort.=20
"We think the (ballot proposals) are a bad idea," said Frank Gallagher,=20
spokesman for the Coalition for Affordable Public Services, the PG&E-financ=
ed=20
group fighting the measures. "They're confusing and do nothing to address t=
he=20
problem."=20
The company has a history of opposing public power proposals, derailing a=
=20
plan in Davis in the 1990s and using a legal challenge to stall the start o=
f=20
Sacramento's Municipal Utility District for two decades.=20
For years, private utilities have enjoyed a powerful hold on state and loca=
l=20
politicians. But the energy crisis has caused widespread public anger and=
=20
concern, forcing city and state officials to take another look at public=20
power.=20
A poll conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California, a=
=20
nonpartisan think tank in San Francisco, found that nearly two-thirds of=20
Californians support the replacement of private electric companies with=20
municipal power authorities formed by local governments.=20
San Francisco already owns a power system, Hetch Hetchy, which provides pow=
er=20
for city departments. PG&E provides power to residents and businesses.=20
The San Francisco Charter amendment placed on the ballot by the supervisors=
=20
calls for abolishing the city's existing Public Utilities Commission, which=
=20
is run by commissioners and a director appointed by the mayor. The proposed=
=20

On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis wit=

regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nic=

publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been=20
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this=20
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument th=
at=20
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis ha=
s=20
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private=20
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that th=
is=20
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation betwee=
n=20
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's=
=20
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a hug=
e=20
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the=20
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,=20
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the=
=20
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required=20
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."=
=20
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urgin=
g=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and=
=20
the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked=
=20
for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,=
=20
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a=20
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality.=20
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly=20

companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the=20

California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles=
=20
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District=
=20
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state=
=20
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping=
=20
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $33=
0=20
per megawatt hour.=20
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis=20
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators=
=20
who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that=
=20
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off=

by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."=20
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, i=

turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business=20

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For the past seven months, Gov. Gray Davis has begged=
,=20
cajoled and even threatened legislators and regulators, to lay the groundwo=
rk=20
for a $12.5 billion bond issue California needs to cover the cost of keepin=
g=20
its lights on.=20
Now comes the tough part: persuading investors that the bond is an attracti=
ve=20
investment. On that score, Mr. Davis's team, whose credibility has been=20
battered by California's months-long electricity crisis, is hoping to bounc=
e=20
back from a rocky start.=20
This week, a delegation headed by state Treasurer Philip Angelides is=20
scheduled to visit Wall Street to pitch the municipal debt offering, which=
=20
would be the largest in U.S. history by a factor of nearly four. To succeed=
,=20
Mr. Angelides will have to allay investors' fears of the kind of political=
=20
infighting that already has delayed the issue several times. He will have t=
o=20
satisfy bond-rating agencies that the bond is safe enough to merit a top-ti=
er=20
investment-grade rating. And he'll have to make investors want to buy it=20
without demanding costly inducements that would give California financial=
=20
headaches for decades to come.=20
"This isn't building the Panama Canal. It's not Apollo 11," says Mr.=20
Angelides. But, he concedes, the bond sale will be "uniquely challenging."=
=20
That is because this giant bond issue won't be backed by the full faith and=
=20
credit of the state or by tax dollars -- the types of guarantees public-deb=
t=20
investors often prefer. Instead, the bonds, which will have maturities of a=
s=20
long as 15 years, are to be paid off by the state's electricity ratepayers=
=20
from their monthly bills, which some view as a riskier source of cash flow.=
=20
Moreover, there is still a question as to whether the issue's proceeds will=
=20
be adequate to repay the bonds, restore the state's financially troubled=20
private utilities to health and finance future electricity purchases.=20
Despite these hurdles, many analysts predict California will eventually=20
succeed in pulling off the bond deal, though at a cost far higher than=20
originally anticipated. In fact, the apparent easing of the state's energy=
=20
crunch may make its marketing job a bit less difficult. A recent drop in th=
e=20
price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, a mild summ=
er=20
in the West and a June decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
to impose electricity price caps in the region have helped avert the rollin=
g=20
blackouts that roiled the state earlier this year.=20
Still, the specter of history overhangs the bond offering. Rating agencies=
=20
are haunted by having failed to warn investors of such public-finance=20
disasters as the 1983 default of the Washington Public Power Supply System=
=20
and the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. Moreover, Moody's Investor=

If the bond sale fails "the state of California will be in deep trouble,"=

education, health care and children's services can be safe."=20
California's need for the bonds -- like most of the state's energy woes --=
=20
stems from its troubled 1996 electricity-deregulation plan. Under the plan,=
=20
the state's investor-owned utilities were obliged to sell many of their pow=
er=20
plants to other companies and purchase electricity through a state-sponsore=
d=20
power auction. Consumer rates were frozen, but wholesale rates weren't.=20
The system worked fairly well until May 2000, when wholesale rates began=20
soaring amid tight electricity supplies and stronger-than-expected demand.=
=20
Last year, the state's cost of wholesale power climbed to $27 billion from =
$7=20
billion in 1999. In the first six months of this year, that sum hit $20=20
billion.=20
With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp., and=
=20
Edison International's Southern California Edison racked up billions of=20
dollars of debts. In January, after power generators stopped doing business=
=20
with the utilities, the state began buying power on their behalf. It borrow=
ed=20
the money from its general fund, normally used to pay for everything from=
=20
public safety and environmental programs to social services and education, =
at=20
a pace of more than $1 billion a month.=20
In February, Mr. Davis's allies in the state Legislature helped him pass a=
=20
bill authorizing the state to sell bonds to replenish the fund and to=20
continue making power purchases. But legislators cautiously capped the size=
=20
of the borrowing, using a complex formula. Under the new law, the formula=
=20
would allow only for a bond sale of less than $1 billion.=20
Realizing that wasn't sufficient, the governor and the assembly drafted=20
another bill that scrapped the formula and allowed the state to sell up to=
=20
$13.4 billion of bonds. But, in a setback for Mr. Davis, Republican lawmake=
rs=20
banded together to deny him the two-thirds majority needed for the bill to=
=20
immediately become law. As a result, the law won't take effect until=20
mid-August, when the public-finance market is all but moribund.=20
In the meantime, Mr. Angelides moved to hire underwriters. After receiving=
=20
four dozen bids from Wall Street investment bankers in February, he retaine=
d=20
a team led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But under pressure to get the financi=
ng=20
moving, the treasurer didn't negotiate firm underwriting fees on the deal.=
=20
At the time, Mr. Angelides said he expected the underwriters to "skinny dow=
n"=20
their fees given the enormous size of the offering. But Morgan, representin=
g=20
a team of underwriters that includes Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Citgrou=
p=20
Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit and Bear, Stearns & Co., says it expects t=
o=20
charge standard fees, given the significant challenges presented by the=20
issue's size. In the case of a $12.5 billion sale, that amounts to around $=
56=20
million. J.P. Morgan and the California treasurer's office now say the fees=
=20
won't be decided until they determine the bond issue's final size and=20
structure.=20
From the start, relations between California officials and Wall Street seem=
ed=20
fraught with miscommunication. In February, Mr. Davis called a meeting to=
=20
explain to institutional investors, analysts and rating-agency executives h=
is=20
blueprint for getting a grip on California's energy crisis. The session, hi=
s=20
only face-to-face meeting with investors to date, was held at Manhattan's=
=20
Cornell Club. Attendees say the governor kept them waiting for 20 minutes=
=20
before breezing into the room and giving them only a general overview of th=
e=20
state's energy plan, which left investors grumbling.=20
During the discussion, Mr. Davis, a Bronx, N.Y., native, made light of a=20
conversation he had had with Richard Cortright Jr., a Standard & Poor's=20
director. "I told him: `You're from Indiana, that explains why you're not=
=20
getting it,'" the governor said, according to several people present.=20
"It was intended as a joke, but no one was laughing," says A.J. Sabatelle, =
a=20
Moody's vice president. A spokesman for Mr. Davis says the governor doesn't=
=20
recall the exchange; Mr. Davis is frequently late for public engagements. A=
=20
spokesman for Mr. Cortright wouldn't comment.=20
Then, in March, the governor's office set up a conference call to update=20
investors. Figuring they wouldn't get a big turnout, they used an open-mike=
=20
system that allowed each investor's comments to be heard by everyone else.=
=20
But with around 100 investors taking part, the presentation by Joseph=20
Fichera, a paid consultant who is one of Mr. Davis's top financial advisers=
,=20
turned into a free-for-all, with one caller cursing Mr. Fichera in response=
=20
to one of his answers.=20
Infighting among California politicians hasn't helped. Earlier this year, f=
or=20
example, state Controller Kathleen Connell criticized the way her fellow=20
Democrats, Messrs. Davis and Angelides, were handling the bond sale. Unless=
=20
it was far bigger, she warned, the state would face a "cash-flow crunch" by=
=20
February or March of 2002. The governor's office fired back, calling her=20
claims "completely" political.=20
California policy makers have "spent most of the year bickering and finger=
=20
pointing," Standard & Poor's director Peter Rigby said in a recent report,=
=20
"and that will raise some uncertainty among lenders." Moreover, investors=
=20
know the state needs the money, and so "it's a buyer's market," Mr. Rigby=
=20
added.=20
Aware that it needed a financial pro to make its case to Wall Street, the=
=20
Davis Administration pushed Mr. Fichera to the forefront. Since May, the=20

.=20
Critical barriers remain. The state's Public Utilities Commission has yet t=

make key decisions intended to ensure that there's enough ratepayer revenue=
=20
set aside to guarantee that bondholders get paid. On Aug. 23, for example,=
=20
the PUC is expected to take up a rate agreement giving the state's power=20
purchaser, the Department of Water Resources, unprecedented authority to=20
raise rates without a public hearing. The commission also is expected to=20
decide how to divvy up current ratepayer revenue among state and private=20
utilities and to take up a measure that would prohibit large industrial=20
consumers from, in effect, bypassing the utilities and buying their juice=
=20
directly from generators or traders.=20
But opponents of those controversial measures are expected to put up a figh=
t.=20
Businesses and consumer groups are particularly upset that the state might=

California already has some of the highest electricity rates in the nation.=

Residential consumers in San Francisco, for instance, pay around 14 cents p=

Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.=20
The state's three largest investor-owned utilities, PG&E, SoCalEd and Sempr=

Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are expected to demand the largest=

that it needs so much money. The pressure to allocate more cash to the=20
utilities could also rise if a state-sponsored bailout plan for SoCalEd fai=

To reassure potential investors, the state now is offering to amass a $3=20

in the power market. In addition, California lawmakers are moving a bill=20

Mild weather means that California is escaping blackouts, but it also means=
=20
that the state is amassing power-trading losses that are adding to the cost=
=20
of an energy mess now in its 15th month.=20
Internal documents show that so far in July, California has resold the=20
equivalent of 8% of the power it bought under short-term and long-term=20
contracts that were designed to reduce the state's reliance on the volatile=
=20
and costly spot market. The problem is, the state has had a surfeit of powe=

and it has been selling the juice into the market at a fraction of the pric=
e=20
it paid, leading to losses from July 1 through Thursday of about $30 millio=
n=20
to $35 million.=20
The losses illustrate the difficulties dogging the state's new energy czar,=
=20
the California Department of Water Resources, despite a softening of=20
electricity prices and demand. The department got into the power-purchasing=
=20
business in a big way in January, when the state's biggest investor-owned=
=20
utilities quit buying power because they were no longer creditworthy. Since=
=20
then, the state has signed $43 billion worth of contracts, one for as much =
as=20
20 years, in a bid to tamp down high spot-market prices. Critics now say it=
=20
was a mistake to lock in so much power at such a high cost.=20
Power officials say the state has been in the odd position since last month=
=20
of having too much power contracted for off-peak hours. "It's something you=
'd=20
expect when you first get into a new business and you'd hope to reduce it,"=
=20
said Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-purchasing agency.=20
Internal numbers from the DWR, which the agency has confirmed, show that on=
=20
average the state paid, from July 1 to Thursday, $123 per megawatt hour for=
=20
some 1.8 million megawatts of power purchased under long-term contracts, an=
d=20
$148 per megawatt hour for some 2.2 million megawatt hours of power purchas=
ed=20
under short-term contracts. In the same period, the records show it sold=20
excess power amounting to 320,000 megawatt hours at an average price of $27=
=20
per megawatt hour, less than what it costs to fuel many plants. At times, t=
he=20
DWR sold the juice for as little as $2 per megawatt hour.=20
This, ironically, has offered an opportunity to power traders that the stat=
e=20
was seeking to hem in through its contract program. They have been able at=
=20
times to substitute cheap power they buy from the state for the more costly=
=20
power they otherwise would have to generate to meet their contract=20
obligations.=20
Despite the agency's power-trading losses, total market costs still are dow=
n=20
substantially from previous months, partly due to price limits set June 19 =
by=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Slacker demand also has been a=20
factor. In June, Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International=
,=20
sold 11.8% less electricity to its customers than in June 2000, reflecting=
=20
energy conservation and reduced demand for air conditioning.=20
Since January the state has spent $9.5 billion buying power at an average=
=20
cost of $237 per megawatt hour, according to internal DWR documents. That i=
s=20
more than double the price of wholesale electricity last year, when prices=

averaged $114. The state's cash-strapped utilities have reimbursed the agen=

$1.53 billion of the $9.5 billion it has spent so far. As a result of the=

Gouger Gray Davis 
California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity

LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.

On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge "has not and cannot be substantiated." Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: "Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not." 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a "raw deal" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to "step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for." Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
"melodramatic virtual world" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power 
companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at "the generators 
who wear cowboy hats" and that "just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate "direct access," which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies. 

Thanks.  Looks like I'm going nonetheless---things I can do up there.

I take it you are no longer going to Portland? I need to cancel your tickets 
then. Would you let me know?
Thanks,
Joseph
Dear All,

As a result of the recent volume of activity in Washington DC, with mediation 
proceedings, refund discussions and the need for key members of our team that 
need to attend these meetings, it has been decided to re-schedule the meeting 
of the Western Government Affairs group to Wednesday, September 12, in 
Portland, 10AM-5PM.

For those of you who had planned on attending, I am sorry to cause you this 
inconvenience.  Hopefully for those of you who wanted to attend, but 
couldn't, this will offer you the opportunity to participate on September 12.

Due to the volatility of policy related issues in our region, I would expect 
there may be some modifications to our current agenda below.  As these 
changes occur I will communicate this information to you.

Any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave

   

Below is a draft agenda for our planned meeting on Wednesday August 1 in 
Portland Oregon from 10-5.  Tim Belden will be joining us from11:30-1PM 
(thanks Debra) and the agenda is taking Tim's time into account.  We will be 
meeting in the Mt. Hood Room, a working lunch will be provided (thanks 
Lysa).  

If you would like to modify the agenda, please send your edits to me.

10:00   Meeting called to order - Brief Introductions - All
10:10   Overview of Western Government Affairs Priorities (Jim or designee?)
11:00   What are the short-term needs of our Western Commerical Staff? (Alan?
)
11:30   Brief Overview of July 12 Rulings and discussion of the potential 
impacts on the West (Ray/Christi/Sarah? and Group)
12:30   RTO/ISO Status Update (in alphabetical order)
  CAISO   (Sue)
  DSTAR   (Dave)
  RTO West  (Steve)
2:00 RTO Strategy discussion "How we move forward and how we should leverage 
the recent FERC July 12 rulings"     (Group/Jim?)
3:30 Meetings, RTO's and WSCC - Ranking and Coverage coordination (Group)
4:30 Northwest OASIS "Enhancements" - Solicitation of Trader Comments (Dave)  
(Note, Alan, can you please ask Diana,   Sean and Bill Williams III to see if 
they can schedule time to attend?)

While developing this agenda from everyone's input I was thinking that NERC 
is beginning to assert more and more influence (good or bad) on the entire 
industry.  I would like to know if our group feels it would be useful to 
invite either Charles Yeung or Andy Rodriquez to our meeting to overview NERC 
activities and or Electronic Scheduling?

Also, if Steve Hall has any legal or contract issues he'd like to discuss 
during our meeting I'll be happy to add time for that.

Again, as noted above this is a draft and as you can see I have 
un-democratically nominated (suggested) folks for leading various 
discussions.  Any comments or confirmations of commitment to lead an agenda 
item would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for everyone's input.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Hi Mike:
Parquet found me to talk about the QF ideas that you guys are bouncing 
around.  I'll be in Portland tomorrow.  You have some time to sit and discuss 
a bit?

Best,
Jeff

thanks lara.

PS--I'm trying hard (but failing) to shift the blame for our stock drop away 
from the bozos running California to the wacky broadband market.  Any help 
you two can provide would be greatly appreciated.

PPS---It's Ms Mona's birthday today.

Hope to see you both real soon.

Best,
Jeff

Today Mona and I attended a meeting of the "California Energy Solutions 
Group" (formerly the AB 1890 Implementation Group).  But for the issues 
discussed below, there's not much else to report from the meeting other than 
folks engaged in a good deal of posturing.

At our urging, the group decided to form a "subcommittee" comprised of a 
subset of the group.  The group will work quickly to develop a "strawperson" 
proposal to present to the larger group for consideration.  The goal is to 
quickly arrive at a "settlement"---ideally by year end, or sooner---that 
everyone can agree to and offer up to Davis, legislators, etc.  

Our "reward" for coming up with the idea is the requirement that we serve on 
the "committee."  In addition to us, the other people on the committee are:

Eve Elsesser will chair the committee---Cogen types
John Fielder---Edison
Mike Florio--TURN
Bill Booth---CLECA
Carolyn McIntyre---Sempra
Smutney--Generators
Aaron Thomas--AES (retail) 
Tony Braun--Munis
Ralph Cavanagh--NRDC
John Flory--CALPX

It is clear that one of the key issues is devising the "benchmark" that the 
CPUC can use to judge the reasonableness of utility purchases---similar to 
the model used for utility procurement on the gas side.  Chris Calger is in 
the office working on the power plant deals and I briefly discussed with him 
ways of devising a politically palatable, commercially defensible benchmark.  
We came up with some ideas that he suggested I pursue further with Bob 
Badeer, Chris Foster and Tim Belden, which I'll do on Monday.   The first 
meeting of the subcommittee is on Tuesday.

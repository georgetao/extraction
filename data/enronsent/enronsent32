Below is the Entergy contact.  I will get back to you asap on how the desk 
intends to trade off the WSPP so you can prepare a memo for the traders.  
Thanks, - Mike

Mike - 

I just spoke to my contact at Entergy.  They have moved exclusively to the 
WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them 
against inconsistent contractual language.  They are not bending on this 
requirement at this time.  As such, I think we need to proceed with signing 
this agreement unless there are any significant issues.  

Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working 
on this).  Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.  Her # is 
281-297-3582.

Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent 
us from executing this contract?  We need them as a counterparty and I do not 
think sleeving is the answer.

Thanks,
Rogers

Mike - As much as I wanted to come to the June 12th WSPP meeting, a conflict 
arose which I am not able to get out of.  In my absence, I asked Christian 
Yoder to help out (general Enron thoughts) and Randy Osteen (Constellation)  
to speak about the EEI "Into Product" if the group wants to understand  a 
little of the history behind it and how the product works (Randy actively 
participated in the review and formulation of the Into Product as well.

Sorry again for missing the meeting.

Talk to you soon.

Elizabeth

At the request of Christi Nicolay, attached please find the definition of an 
"Into Product" that was prepared by a group of industry participants working 
with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI)  (this definition is also available 
on the EEI web page).  The only other definition of an "Into" product of 
which I am aware is the information that is available on the Cinergy web page 
or the definition published by NYMEX for its "Into Entergy" product.  If you 
have any questions about the "Into" energy product that is so commonly traded 
in the over-the-counter market in the East (eg "Into Entergy", "Into TVA", 
"Into Cinergy", "Into ComEd"), please don't hesitate to call me.

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication
Not Discoverable

Hi Tim

Leslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still 
have relating to PCA.  

PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed  
a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected 
receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had 
with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract 
provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) 
and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still 
a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the 
current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any 
additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the 
bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to 
other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other 
creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment 
that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).

Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell 
her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the 
unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such 
amounts received from PCA back to you. 

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, 
I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if 
we get any "cap" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't 
accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover 
entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the 
past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may 
not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him 
tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the 
termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case 
our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what 
you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks

As we discussed,  I will need further assistance from you to complete several 
of the entries.  I have put your names by the entries that will either need

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI

Andy Katz sent out the following message...We have had many 
undeliverables...I would appreciate your letting me know if you receive this 
message...thanks.
Working Group Members:

The drafting commitee met on September 15 to discuss the status of the Master 
Agreement and the agenda for the October 13 meeting at EEI's offices.  The 
general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is 
sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of 
version 2.1.  Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to 
cover the following at the October 13 meeting :

GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.  The drafting committee believes that the number 
one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the 
marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status 
of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract 
that are holding up its use.  We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider 
acceptance of the Master Agreement.  The drafting committee has thought of 
holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues 
such as establsihing credit thresholds.

STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.  There are  several areas not addressed 
in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental 
provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.  The drafting committee 
identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional 
supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with 
a counterparty:   (1)  the incorporation of prior transactions as being 
governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for 
electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4) 
treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional 
products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to 
agency relationships; (7) "regulatory out" provisions; and (8) provisions 
involving "one-way" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases 
only.

The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop 
these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting 
committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI 
website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.  We will 
also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general 
terms.

PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.  The drafting committee will 
discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.  One 
suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI 
website.

As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or 
need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia 
Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you.

operations in Ontario or Alberta.  I also need someone in the Toronto office 
to provide me with the definition of "Interval Meters" that I have included 
as a potential delivery point.  I have left that definition as a bullet and 
we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense.  
Finally, once the last few business issues are resolved next week, I would 
like to set up a call with Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager to obtain final 
internal legal approval on this agreement so that our commercial people can 
commence marketing the paper to potential counterparties.  Mark Powell will 
be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form 
of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that 
may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in 
duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place.

Thanks

Hi  Charlotte

The week of the 16th looks good for me.  How about Wed. the 18th at 6:00 pm?  
If this doesn't work, I'm very flexible that week.  Let me know.  Thanks and 
I look forward to playing.

Elizabeth

ps  I'm out the rest of this week so lets confirm early next week.

Hi

Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you 
standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark 
room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a 
lawyer could love ... OK tolerate.  I'll send you the presentation by mail.  
Hopefully I didn't get too carried away.

Looking forward to seeing you Friday.

Can you send him a hard copy (He is w Constellation)  thanks

 What a job!

I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic

     We revised our CAISO language to address the 10 minute pricing
implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language
also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either
the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price
paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works?

ES--Can one of the attorneys comment to Joe this week on any legal issues in

Jim -- EPSA already acts as our agent on generic NERC matters, especially the 
Market Interface Committee.  EPSA will not get involved in the NERC regions 
such as WSPP, since these are local matters.  If we do not have the resources 
to be effective in the WSCC region, we should discuss pulling out with Tim.

Top Legal Risks

1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak.  
Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated 
damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination 
damages, broad performance outs.

2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent 
acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as 
to which entity is liable for which trades.

3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.

4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a 
result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.

5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on 
a very tight time schedule.

6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on 
how to document transactions involving power.

7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure 
everybody understands risks associated with transactions.

Documentation Projects

1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen 
reliance on WSPP.

2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual 
transactions that are not part of a master.

3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power 
product definitions.

4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all 
e-trading.

5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  -  
work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll 
that into single contract for physical and financial trading

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

USA: Enron earnings rise 31 percent, beat expectations.

10/17/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 

	

TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

See you between 200 and 230

Janette

Mark had asked me to call Williams and invite them to the ISDA Energy meeting 
in Houston last week.  Tim at Williams very much wanted to participate.  As 
you can see from his email, he must not be on the distribution list for 
ISDA.  Can you see if it is OK to add him to the distribution list for future 
meetings.  Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to 
participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also 
get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master 
for all trades.  I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you.  
Thanks for your help.

Elizabeth 36349

PS Mark 

At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross 
defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.  It 
seems that there is alot of interest in this idea.

Elizabeth,
Is it possible that we can be included on future mailings/meetings of the
North America Energy and Developing Products Committee - due to the late
notice of the last meeting on 10/10 in Houston we were unable to send a
representative.  We will, with ample notice, attempt to send a
representative to future meetings as Williams has an interest in the topics
that would be discussed.  Thanks for your assistance.  Tim

Hi Tim

Thanks for your message.  We absolutely will forward to ISDA your message so 
that you can receive notices of the Energy Product meetings ( I thought you 
were already getting them).  Look forward to seeing you again soon.

Elizabeth

I agree w Tracy - the Calpine master is legally sufficient for trades and our 
relationship w Calpine is sensitive.  We do not need to push the EEI Master 
unless they want it in which case we are happy to oblige.  Just FYI, 
depending on  the trade we would likely like to  add product definition (eg 
West Firm, Into Product since products are not defined in master).  

John

When you are ready with the deal terms, just let me know and we can find the 
right person to help you document it given the nature of the product involved.

Hi Dede
Just wondering if you would be able to hit next week? How about Monday 
(anytime anywhere) or Wednesday?  Also, I see that Shari has sent out CAISO 
language which I have not yet reviewed.  Maybe we can also schedule a real 
meeting on Monday to finalize.  Let me know if that works for you.  See ya.

Welcome back - hope your sojourn was not alarming (NY is not that bad a place 
to happen upon independence),and the autumn leaves made you smile.
Talk to you soon.

lets do Mon at lunch.  call you to confirm.

Still on for 1200 today?  Court 3.  See ya there unless I hear from you.   

Hi Alex

THANKS - Ella rec'd the bathing suit and loves it.  She put it on and 
wouldn't take it off.  Perfect size.  Perfect gift.

WE ARE COMING - hope that's still OK.  We finally booked our flight to NY.  
We are planning on coming up on Sat. July 22nd and leaving on Sunday the 
30th.  Not sure of the plans from there but will call you later.  If this

Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the revised PPA for Indian Mesa 
II.? I apologize for not being able to distribute this in the "track changes" 
format, but because of numerous internal drafts, the track changes document 
was simply too confusing with internal comments showing as deletions.? As a 
result, you will not be able to go into the blacklined version and 
accept/reject changes, nor make additional changes to such document without 
such changes being re-inserted into the "clean" version.? 

If you have any problems opening the attachments, please contact me at

Hi Shari,

Christian asked me to review these inc/dec examples.  I think these are an 
excellent idea and will be very helpful to your counterparties in 
understanding how the Adjustment Payment works in combination with inc/dec 
pricing.

I made some corrections to the examples, which I have attached as a redline 
document so that you can see what I did.  You will also see that I added a 
few words here and there to clarify things.  The other document is a clean 
version incorporating all of the proposed changes from the redlined document.

John,

We need to make sure we are valuing the spread option using only No. 2 oil in 
Dec, Jan & Feb.  We will almost certainly be curtailed during blow out events 
in the winter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use nat gas as the 
winter fuel.

	Janice R Moore
	10/26/2000 08:22 AM
		 
Do you suppose that Shari could handle this for John today?  This is the 
first I've seen of the term sheet, and I haven't even taken the time to read 
it, so I'm not even sure exactly what this deal is.  "Tolling" means so many 
different things..............  Shari sent this company an EEI Master this 
summer and has been bugging them about it but w/ no response (according to 
the database).  Maybe this would be a good opportunity to advance 
that.........
And I'm still working on the Maine SOS proposal, and VPPSA and the N. 
Carolina project that David Fairley wants comments on yesterday, as well as 
the Reedy Creek stuff that came up as a rush yesterday afternoon (I've left 
you a vmail on that).

Attached is an indicative term sheet I shared with the customer yesterday 
relating to the referenced tolling transaction.  Preliminary feedback from 
the customer has been positive, so I am hopeful that we will come to mutually 
agreeable pricing and terms on this transaction.   I should get some 
additional feedback sometime today. 

I have raised the flag with the customer that we need to put paper and credit 
terms in place, and given their desire to close on this quickly, we will 
likely need to move quickly on this today/tomorrow.   As for cedit, their 
consultant indicated that a corp guarantee from the Black Hill Power Corp 
parent is probably not the customer's preferred approach, but rather credit 
arrangements tagged specifically to the project.  The project is owned by 
Black Hills Energy Capital, which invests in power projects through some sort 
of investment fund.  Their consultant speculated that Enron might have some 
interests in that investment fund relating to some projects out West, but he 
wasn't sure.   In any event, depending on their desire to move forward with 
us, we will need to be ready to talk credit/contract with them on short 
notice.

I'll keep you all updated on any feedback i get from the customer.

Regards
John

As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been 
speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based 
upon EEI but has been "retyped" making changes based upon variations in the 
way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the 
basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, 
differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and 
stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to 
advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants 
the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the 
reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a 
meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At 
that time, we could also discuss the significant "policy differences" to make 
sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons 
for the differences.

Thanks

for power trading

ENA's Legal Power Trading group supports all of Enron's U.S.-based, wholesale 
trading legal requirements.  Enron is the largest marketer of wholesale power 
in the U.S.  This group currently has 6 lawyers (one located in Portland).  
Responsibilities include negotiating master trading agreements and structured 
power transactions, interfacing with industry trade groups to develop 
business practices and managing risks associated with the world's most 
volatile commodity.

Hi John

Thanks for the call.  I'll be in Thursday all day after 10:00 (dentist in
the am - yuk).  Lets try to get together then on the agency stuff.

I also think this is a great idea - there would be a tremendous benefit if 
the EEI contract became the standard for on-line trading platforms.  While 
Enron currently uses simplified GTCs for trading online with those 
counterparties with whom we do not have a Master Power Trading Contract (if 
we do that agreement governs power trades), we have talked about and likely 
will eventually make the EEI contract the "default" contract if there are no 
other arrangements in place.  I would fully support and provide any 
assistance to pursue this idea with and through EEI.

	drusso@reliantenergy.com
	10/30/2000 06:07 PM
		 
GREAT IDEA!!!
Let me know how RES can support such an effort.

Andy,

I could provide language by the end of next week, if needed by then.

Separately, I understand that we intend to emphasize marketing efforts
towards all potential EEI users, but utilities in particular due to that
group's lower acceptance rate to date.  Another "group" to which I believe
that we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online trading
platforms.

Three types of online trading platforms presently exist: (1)proprietary
exchanges (EnronOnline, Dynegydirect); (2) consortium platforms (ICEX); and
(3) independent, third-party platform (Altra) [these platforms are similar
to (2)but differ in that the shareholders/backers have not committed
liquidity].  The volumes traded on these types of electric platforms are
significant and growing.  According to MegawattDaily, Ameren Energy
conducts
about 40% of next-day deals and 30% of forwards on various electronic
platforms.  There are presently close to 25 platforms (of course, with so
many competitors, as usually happens, there will probably be a weeding out
and/or consolidations/mergers...the Jurassic period notwithstanding, as
blame for the mass dinosaur extinction lay with an errant meteor or
possibly
the taking up of cigarette smoking by the majority of the dinosaurs
according to Larsen...all apologies for the joke).

As each platform system has different definitions, products, and contracts,
and as several of the platforms are considering adopting standard
contracts,
I believe an opportunity exists to push the EEI as either the exclusive
standard agreement used for trading on a particular platform or as a
default
agreement for those proprietary and other platforms under which trading
partners lack executed Masters with the counterparty.  In fact, according
to
published sources, Houston Street, RedMeteor, and others have been working
with others for several months on developing industry standards.

Just a thought.

Babak

Some random thoughts:

There was a teleconference today regarding the credit annex.  Bill McCoy
should have draft language by early next week.  This draft only addresses
EEI transactions, but could easily be expanded to transactions under other
master agreements.  I will circulate Bill's draft as soon as I get it.
Randy Baker & Michelle McLendin (Duke), and Lisa Grof & Frank Hilton (AEP)
have volunteered to work on the on the credit annex subcommittee.

According to my notes, assignments for the remaining optional provisions
are
as follows:

1) Incorporating old  trades - Elizabeth
2) One-way transactions - Buddy
3) New products e.g. Western Firm/CAISO - Dede & Elizabeth
4) Regulatory Out - John Crespo & Randy Osteen
5) New taxes - Fritz
6) ADR - Patty
7) Agency relationship - Elizabeth
8) Electronic Exchanges - Babak

Additional provisions
9) Credit Annex - Bill McCoy, et al.
10) incorporating prior trades not under netting, Frank Stllingwerf
11) Broker Confirmations ?
12) Over Deliveries - Phyliss Lemel

What kind of deadline for these assignments is realistic?

Randy Osteen & I plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshop
in
Atlanta we plan to hold at the end of January.  If anyone has ideas for the
program please let us know.

I plan to fix up the contract web page next week

Sterling Koch of TransAlta said he would like to set up a presentation
opportunity for an EEI contract representative to talk to the Canadian
standardization group.

Finally, EEI has a block of rooms and meeting space at the Four Seasons in
Newport Bearch, CA for our Legal Committee from April 18-21.  We would like
to shorten our meeting to two days.  Ed has offerred the block of rooms and
meeting space to us for the night of the 20th and the 21st if we want to
put
on a conference or hold a meeting then.  Something to think about.

Jim - 

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  While I'm still checking,  I am 
not aware that there is a "formal process" for being a board member of a 
non-corporate entity like SPP. We would, however,  want to look at the 
equivalent of SPPs Bylaws to make sure that members are not going to be 
liable for actions taken and to see if SPP has something like D&O insurance, 
protecting the members.  We can talk to SPP and see what there is.  Let me 
know if you want us to request/review documents.  Thanks

Elizabeth --

Ron McNamara heads up Government Affairs activities for SPP.  He has been 
asked to be a member of the SPP Board.  This would be great for EPMI because 
we would have more ability to influence SPP and its actions regarding opening 
the market.

What form of approval do we need to have internally (if any) before Ron can 
become a SPP Board Member?  Are there any internal restrictions on this type 
of activity? 

Not sure if there are any risks, but I want to make sure that Ron won't be 
harmed by pursuing this opportunity.

Thanks,

Jim

Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning 
that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in 
determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?  Shari has had numerous 
conversations with a Greg Malcolm there and he has said that they are very 
interested in contracting with EPMI using EEI.  He and Shari have a call 
scheduled for Nov 20th.  

Just curious.

I've attempted to draft language for the "CAISO Schedule Adjustment"
definition, as we discussed yesterday.  We can discuss this proposed
language in our call tomorrow:

"CAISO Schedule Adjustment" means a schedule change implemented by the CAISO
on a schedule coordinator-schedule coordinator transaction after the CAISO's
final hourly scheduling deadline for the transaction, and on which
transaction the CAISO imposes Inc and Dec Prices.  Such schedule change
shall neither be caused by, nor within the control of, either Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a CAISO Schedule Adjustment shall not be
deemed to occur if the schedule change is due to (i) the curtailment of
imports into, or exports from, California; (ii) load deviations; (iii) the
failure of a Party to accurately submit or balance its schedule with the
CAISO.

I'm available on the 8th

Tickets were still available so I'm going.  Commitment.

Regrettably, Enron also can not participate today - Monday does not work for 
me either but in my absence Shari Stack could participate.  Let me know and I 
will coordinate schedules with Shari. 

I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we 
intended.

More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to 
DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all.

On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is 
addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you 
supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office 
convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to "Canadianize" it, 
thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts.

PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned 
playing tennis on Monday morning before the meeting.  Still not going?

As always, thanks for your help.  

Hey I just realized I have babysitting on Friday.  Any chance you can play?  

how about anytime between 2 and 3 Houston time.  If not, I could also do 
1130.  Let me know

2 hours later my crown is on, my teeth are happy but for the #3 upper right 
molar, which the dentist says, unbeknown to me, is abscessed.  I now need a 
root canal.  Soon.   That will make 562,003 to 1.

 Happy playing

From Rick Antonoff:

Following our telephone conversations on Sunday and Tuesday, please find
attached our revised preliminary draft memorandum addressing the bankruptcy
issues that we have been discussing, and incorporating the additional facts
raised during our telephone conferences this week.  Based on our
discussions and the revisions made to the draft Settlement Agreement this
week, our draft memorandum is now based upon the Avista transaction.

Attached are clean and redline versions of the revised draft.  The redline
is marked to show changes from the draft we circulated on December 22,
2000.

We look forward to receiving your thoughts and comments after you have an
opportunity to review the memorandum.

Regards.

In the interest of time, I am forwarding the attached contract to Kevin 
Hughes, Wanda Curry, Don Black, Ron Adzegary, and Marty Sunde.  Please read 
the attached and confirm that this is your understanding of the  PGET/EPMI/ 
EEMC assignment.  

I am also at this time forwarding to the working group my four main points, 
which I think reflect my main areas of concern under the drafts:

1.  I would like to say  that  the price is the same under the transactions.  
Transaction costs should be dealt with separately. 
2. While we have agreed to take a pass through of the bankruptcy risk,  this 
draft provides that we take on all contract dispute risk.  As I understand 
it, EPMI intends to pass through all risk, such as change in delivery point 
risk, under the contract.  Since EPMI is our sole provider of power to EES 
(other than  the PGET contract), EPMI is in the best position to manage  
general contract risk with its counterparties, as it does today with all our 
physical electricity purchases.  EPMI may  have disputes under contracts for 
many reasons that EEMC is not aware of and will not be in a position to 
influence once the contracts are  assigned to Avista.
3. I assume if EPMI  trades out of  these positions as it manages its own 
portfolio, the credit risk would not follow to subsequent counterparties and 
the EPMI/EES confirm terms would revert to typical confirm language.
4.  I was operating under the assumption that the tax issue would be resolved 
with Steve Douglass prior to signing the main documents.  I am not sure 
whether this issue can be quantified by EES tax today.  Any suggestions or 
ability to resolve/quantify today?  Same concern for the accounting issues.  
My concern here is that if the transaction leaves us in a worse economic 
position as a result of making EPMI whole, this would need to be addressed 
with our business people. 

Elizabeth and JOhn, what are the next steps. 

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

As requested, attached is a draft of an internal letter between EEMC and EPMI 
relating to the PG&E transaction.  I will touch base to review the issues 
associated with it.  John

Thanks for getting it set up.

Confidential - Attorney Work Product/Not Discoverable

A. PGE

I. Termination Rights Based on the Failure to Post Collateral

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on PGE's 
or one of its subsidiaries's failure to post collateral as required by the 
underlying contracts":

1.  PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA  - Enron exposure $23 million

2.  PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure $215 million

3. PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

4.PGE Canada/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure $1 million

II. Termination Rights Based on PG&E's Failure to Pay Indebtedness

It is possible that we could terminate the following contracts based on 
PG&E's or one of its subsidiaries's default on indebtedness in excess of a 
threshold (either $100 million or $50 million):

1. PG&E/ENA - Financial ISDA - Enron Exposure $23 million

2. PG&E/EPMI Physical Power -Enron exposure ($90 million)

3.PGET Power/ENA - Physical Coal - Enron exposure $200,000

4.PGET Power/ENA - Financial GTC - Enron exposure ($6.2 million)

5.PGET Power/EPMI - Physical power - Enron exposure (out of the money, 
currently used to net other EEMC power master which is net in the money $215 
million - see contract 2 above)

6.PGE Canada/Enron Canada - Physical gas - Enron exposure $15 million

7.  PGE Canada/ENA -Physical Gas- Enron exposure $1 million

8. PGET Gas/Enron Canada - Enron Exposure ($2.3 million)

9.PGET Gas/ENA -Financial ISDA - Enron exposure $ 48 million

10. PGET Gas/ENA - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($25 million)

11. PGET Gas/EES - Physical gas - Enron exposure ($700,000)

Most of the above agreements are supported by a guaranty from PG&E's parent 
(PG&E Corporation) in the amount of $475,000,000.  We have not yet made 
demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated 
subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.  

Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.  Before terminating, we would need 
to verify actual contract language.

B.  SCE Default

SCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to  a power 
sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) 
based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $100 million. 
Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then 
terminate and accelerate amounts due.  Amounts payable could offset amounts 
owed by SCE to EPMI or its Affiliates including Enron Wind or Portland 
General.

looks great.  thanks for your help.

is the tournament on Sat or Sun or both? round robin?
thanks
looking forward to hitting tomorrow

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for "Year 1" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for "Year 35" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly "running in the other direction" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied "mid-stream" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged "contract year" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month "Year 35" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a "global" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the "excess" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS "self bills" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
"overpayments" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the "excess" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?

Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of "Contract Capacity Factor" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage "haircut" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years "and thereafter from year to year," unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective "at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter." (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain "stub" years and certain "long" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying "calendar year" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an "indication" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
"contract year" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those "old school" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

Peter, just a follow-up to your email.

1.  I would agree that OPG is mistaken.  After the meeting, Chris and I and 
others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract 
administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial 
settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be 
delivered power.  On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ 
a product definition that works with the physical master.  I know Chris is 
already working on this.  From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not 
that different from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that 
you could incorporate into the physical master.

2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and 
there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing).   
This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This 
is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same 
place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree 
that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO 
energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things 
we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the 
NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in 
the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique 
to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I 
were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the 
Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool 
fails.  Just FYI, the god awful "Into"product in the US was created by Enron 
for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool 
market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to 
change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined 
control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was 
unavailable.  

Harrison called this am at home.  He said that you'all had discussed plans 
for Sat.  Because it's his B-day he wants to go out  - He seemed to suggest 
that you were on board, so I said OK too.  Hope that's OK.  There may be a 
basketball game and dinner in the offing.  Talk to you soon.

done

I think I could 3:30 (deal may be closing, but unlikely - if it did I might 
have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try 
hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try 
there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is 
terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just 
let me know and we can find another time.

Attached are the final PPA and GPSA documents.  No change was made to Section 
5.02(g) due to Kevin Presto's discussion with Roger.  Looks like we are going 
to try and get this accepted by AA as is.  I did make change in Section 
2.01(b) per Gail's suggestion.

Please give me a call when you get a chance letting me our timeline from 
receiving word back from AA.

Thanks again, - Mike

As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.  I 
drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery 
term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in 
mind.  Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take 
and we can revise accordingly.
Thanks

Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made 
in support of EPMI's obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy 
Purchase Agreement ("PPA") and Green  Premium Sharing Agreement ("GSPA").? 
The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract 
guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our 
Cabazon Wind Power Project (the project most recently financed by EWC) and 
the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty.  As we discussed 
last week, since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will 
acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we 
should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was 
negotiated by Enron and the banks.  We plan to use the same basic form for 
the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the 
seller's obligations under the PPA.  We will forward the draft of that 
guaranty to you later today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have 
any questions concerning the attached guaranties.  Thank you.

morning's paper reports that a rate increase of 40% may be imposed by the 
CDWR as early as today and the new bond issue amount is purported to be 16 
billion (rather than the 10 initially discussed)

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " 
future California", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put place between 
the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or 
more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- 

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

sounds great .  see ya there.

Hi Carol

Good luck on your search.

Liz-
We areleaving for Block Island on Monday and I wanted to get you some info.
for your trip.
I am forwarding by Fed Ex tonight keys for the apt. and for the house.

NYC Address: 156 First Avenue between 9th and 10th Street Buzzer # 21 Ground
floor apartment on right back ..
Good Breakfast place for Family is the KKK on first Avenue between 12th and
13th St... or is it 11th and 12th.. LOOK on right side as you go up the
avenue.. cheap and good with garden in the back......
Directions to house from NYC:

Take the West Side Highway in Manhattan to the G.W. bridge. Go to upper
level of bridge and stay in right side lane. ..take first right hand exit
after going over the bridge onto the Palisades ParkwayNorth. Stay on
Palisades until you see exit (9??)for Route 287 North to Albany (to New York
State Thruway) on right. Go North on thruway to Exit 19 Kingston. ( about an
hour ). Once through the toll, stay on the right and merge onto the traffic
circle taking first right exit to Route 28 Pine Hill. Take Route 28 all the
way to Fleischmanns Exit (about 50 minutes ....You'll go past Olive ,
Boiceville , Shandanken, Phoenicia, Pine Hill). Take exit and round bend
into town.
Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just before
it onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to Elk
Creek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement on
Left.. , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street
) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vly
creek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left.. White with
unstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are two
driveways .. use the second for easy unloading through back.

Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat
(brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360..
Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel
driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the
need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and
Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they
have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call
them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit
environmental group..

Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his
driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past
the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on
right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house..
(I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just
watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery
across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for
nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to
Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other
peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in
the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We
also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...

Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and
take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility
with life guards and the  "beach " looks a little fakey from the road but
the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek
swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch
of cars along the road chances are that's one....

In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public
swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good
place to hang and play frisbee with the kids...
Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or
hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that
road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on
right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful
vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps
of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a
cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository..

For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on
the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the
cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a
Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30
there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a
wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps....
Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store..
cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on
route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster.....

Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good
browsing..
Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with
restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop..
Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by
relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!!

Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our
pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help
get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking
or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-
We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the
basement.. The Spring is located on the "high road" going back towards
Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little
bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you
see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the
left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road
across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is
just fine for bathing and rinsing food...
Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as
the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing
if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it
gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the
public
showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could
borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole
system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him
when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville
where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in
the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on
top of the Fridge....

room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some
reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...
otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent
rep.

Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!

Thanks for the documents.  If OK w you, I will look at during my flight on

OK, please leave me a voice mail and I will try to review earlier.

Thanks

PS - Chris, I agree with your  comment re the EEI copyright  and references - 
I'm not sure what the right answer is - do you want to continue calling it 
an""EEI Canada"?  Is that OK with EEI? Do you think we should rename it in 
the name of the organization that "approves" it?  Is that OK w EEI?  Maybe 
you should discuss at meeting and then we can discuss with Andy from EEI to 
get EEI's approval/consent.

Jeff

 I enjoyed speaking with you on the flight back to Houston.  As promised,

all you want,  If you can - mark it up by hand and  fax it to me before you 
go to Ella's school function. (My FAX NO. is  (503) 464-8058.)   I will then 
turn the document around in advance of our call with Gayle McKenzie at Morgan 
Lewis which is confirmed w/ her and has been set up for  2pm Houston time on 
Tuesday. 

If you need to reach me - please call Jan King on (503) 464-8814 or my direct

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

Elizabeth:

Attached is draft of the termination payment letter with a few suggested 
changes, but nothing major.  I tried to include a blackline, but it seemed to 
get corrupted so I don't know if it will be of much use to you. A few notes:

(1)  I did not have the various contracts with me when I reviewed this, but I 
have asked Jim if he could make sure I did not make any inaccurate statements 
as well as input the few contract section references that are open and the 
information on the Canadian termination.  (However, I was not sure whether 
you wanted Peter Keohane to input the relevant information on the Canadian 
side.).

(2)  In light of PG&E's letter to us, I thought we may want to make some 
short statements about the affiliate set off rights under the Bankruptcy Code 
in the termination letter.

(3)  I modified some of the language on the CalPX liabilities.  I didn't have 
my exposure sheet with me, but I thought I recall that we were both owed 
money from the CalPX  and that we had some risk on the chargeback liability 
depending on how FERC ultimately comes out on the issue.  As you know, the 
FERC decision about 3 weeks ago prohibited the CalPX from proceeding with the 
chargeback "under these circumstances" or some type of language like this, 
but it seemed to have punted the final resolution of the issue until at least 
the commandeered contract valuation issue had been resolved--thus, although 
perhaps not likely, it seemed to me at the time that FERC gave itself an 
opening to reconsider the chargeback issue after the valuation determination 
had been made.

(4)  While I bracketed the language, I thought we may want to affirmatively 
and briefly set forth the business reason why EPMI is holding the direct 
access claim to at least give them something to think about.  As we have 
discussed, PG&E's likely reaction will be that we are using unsupportable 
self help to not pay them anything on the termination of the 3 power 
confirmations by claiming a set off for the negative CTCs.  To the extent we 
can articulate a short business rationale for EPMI having that claim, it may 
at least make them pause as to whether our business rationale arguably could 
prevail.

(5)  We note in the letter certain claims we have against PG&E that we are 
not setting off--e.g., the ISDA termination payment.  We also reference the 
claims held by EPMI through the CalPX, even though we are not "terminating" 
any "contracts" in that respect.  I assume that we do not want to reference 
in the letter the claims held by Portland General which "route" through the 
CalPX and the ISO, even though we are not claiming rights of offset for 
those.  PG&E will be put on notice of those when we put in Portland's claims 
as part of our proof of claim with the bankruptcy court.

 I'll plan on getting together with you to review this tomorrow afternoon.  
Lastly, I have not read the decision yet, but I saw that the DC Circuit 
upheld FERC in all respects in the PCA case so since our contracts do not 
have to be on file, they can be terminated without waiting for the 60 day 
period to expire.  That should reduce another potential challenge to the 
power contract termination.

Thanks.

John

Attached is draft escrow language for Black Hills that I made up in an 
attempt to be sympathetic to Black Hills's desire for certainty on the 
release of funds - please review and call Shari with comments first thing on 
Wed.  I will be travelling Wed but will check messages on Wed afternoon.  
Good luck

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Hi

We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 
1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing 
invitations now.  Here it is: 

Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo?  
Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer 
to  ..... shop.

PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday.

Thanks for your message

Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator.  
Coaching seems to be his real passion.

I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are 
scrambling to find a birthday concept.

On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - 
let me know when you can.

Talk to you soon.

Let's try for thurs at 1130 - call me if you need to change time/date.

Sorry for the delay but here it is  - A good landscape architect in the 
Heights is Pam August (husband name Todd) who lives on Cortdlandt (sorry no 
number) between 7th and 8th.

HI Just got this message - email at home couldn't open attachment.  Go ahead 
a send rest when you can, no problem.  Hey, will you send me your new address.
thanks

Liz-
We areleaving for Block Island on Monday and I wanted to get you some info.
for your trip.
I am forwarding by Fed Ex tonight keys for the apt. and for the house.

NYC Address: 156 First Avenue between 9th and 10th Street Buzzer # 21 Ground
floor apartment on right back ..
Good Breakfast place for Family is the KKK on first Avenue between 12th and
13th St... or is it 11th and 12th.. LOOK on right side as you go up the
avenue.. cheap and good with garden in the back......
Directions to house from NYC:

Take the West Side Highway in Manhattan to the G.W. bridge. Go to upper
level of bridge and stay in right side lane. ..take first right hand exit
after going over the bridge onto the Palisades ParkwayNorth. Stay on
Palisades until you see exit (9??)for Route 287 North to Albany (to New York
State Thruway) on right. Go North on thruway to Exit 19 Kingston. ( about an
hour ). Once through the toll, stay on the right and merge onto the traffic
circle taking first right exit to Route 28 Pine Hill. Take Route 28 all the
way to Fleischmanns Exit (about 50 minutes ....You'll go past Olive ,
Boiceville , Shandanken, Phoenicia, Pine Hill). Take exit and round bend
into town.
Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just before
it onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to Elk
Creek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement on
Left.. , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street
) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vly
creek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left.. White with
unstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are two
driveways .. use the second for easy unloading through back.

Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat
(brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360..
Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan & Adele Seigel
driveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel the
need.. I'm sure Eric will stop by with his new puppy Clifford.. Karen and
Jim Rauter live on the high road.. (Lake Street extension) 254 4180.. they
have a little boy Julian about Sam's age.. Again please feel free to call
them.. She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profit
environmental group..

Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too.... Walk down his
driveway until you get to trailer .... garden on right... veer off left past
the trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond on
right.. Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond .. His new house..
(I helped design) is on top of the hill....Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.just
watch for fast traffic.. nice views.. walk through little abandoned cemetery
across the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields for
nice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back to
Johnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through other
peoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon in
the yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's .. until we go off the road..We
also left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...

Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . .. Go back to Route 28 and
take left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facility
with life guards and the  "beach " looks a little fakey from the road but
the swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock.. There are some creek
swimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if  you see a bunch
of cars along the road chances are that's one....

In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a public
swimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts.. another good
place to hang and play frisbee with the kids...
Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas.. or
hike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow that
road until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking on
right... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautiful
vista and a not too strenuous hike.. You can find these places on the maps
of the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of a
cabinet in the Living Room .. This is our too busy to put away depository..

For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket on
the left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway.. it is the
cheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on a
Sat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30
there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in a
wonderful old round barn.. See attached maps....
Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping.... wine store..
cheese store and an A&P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place on
route 28 in Arkville.. He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster.....

Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for good
browsing..
Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel with
restaurant and is very pretty.. also has good thrift shop..
Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run by
relocated tasteful city folk.. good food!!!

Things about the house.... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in our
pipes in the bathroom.. don't be alarmed.. just adjust the controls to help
get rid of it..... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cooking
or drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-
We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in the
basement.. The Spring is located on the "high road" going back towards
Fleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is.. go over little
bridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 100 yards until you
see a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on the
left side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the road
across from the pine stand.... It is delicious water... The house water is
just fine for bathing and rinsing food...
Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering as
the water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thing
if there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it.. If it
gets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to the
public
showers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you could
borrow hers...  We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the whole
system so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact him
when we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretville
where you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing in
the creek while you wait..P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is on
top of the Fridge....

Well I think that's the most of it.. I'll call you from Block Island with
our number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 911...our
fire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on Main
Street in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergency
room on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for some
reason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...
otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help .. she has an excellent
rep.

Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!

I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel 
while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas 
Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is 
out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend 
to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think.

PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi.  
Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think.

Mark , I assume that I should continue work on this. If its OK with you, I 
would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we 
should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for 
physical/financial(maybe) trading.

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,

I think it looks great - my only thought really is on the middle section 
relating to cleaning laying out the elements of negligence and a statement of 
the standard to be applied  - I quickly revised your section to give you an 
idea of what I was thinking.  In any event I think you are absolutely on the 
right track.  Good luck and let me know what else I can do.

Attached is a brief memo I prepared in anticipation of the meeting scheduled 
for Wed., May 23rd, to discuss setoff issues.  Please call if you have any 
questions or comments.

Thanks

per our discussion

Chi is now confused.  She want to do the wedding but is feeling overwhelmed 
by all the issues:

Mom
Her sickness
John
Short notice for all involved creating tension
She and Douglas feeling stressed as a result of above
Mom

She seeks advice from a sage Midwesterner.

What do you think - Delay or hasten onward

Sorry I didn't get too far but What I read I think is looking great - good 
luck

Hi John

Today has disappeared so I don't think we will be able to squeeze in a 
meeting.  The Black Hills deal is still stuck in credit land so I will call 
the Denver office if need be.  Thanks again and I look forward to speaking 
with you soon.

Hi Charlotte

I'd love to play but I can't this week. Yuck. Let's try next week.  

PS Doubles was fun - I haven't played much doubles and it really is a 
different rhythm. Maybe we could play doubles sometime soon too

See you soon

That would be great! Lets investigate immediately.  I think I remember the 
Broadmore being listed in Tennis magazine as one of the top 10 places to 
play.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

Hi

Sorry to hear about being SICK - the only good there is re-experiencing the 
pure joy of being merely healthy.  After that nothing bad matters.  Would 
love to see you sometime - maybe next week lunch?  The Heights is still grand 
... too me.  Come by or call anytime.  Address  822 Columbia (on Columbia 
between 8th and 9th) Phne 713 8644023.

See ya
Elizabeth

FYI. This is a pretty paper on legal/risk aspects of power trading. I think 
it would help in training future lawyers/staff.

I have received this note (for free) from Baker & McKenzie, which was 
prepared by one of their US offices.
Feel free to distribute this to anyone within Enron who you think find it 
interesting.

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to
immediately address any failures.

I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to 
distribute
it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of 
taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, 
so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - 
this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting 
issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll.

Attached is a draft of a PPA/Tolling Agreement that we were negotiating last 
year in connection with the potential disposition of our 99 Peaking Assets.  
I believe you have seen this one before (in fact, I my memory serves my 
correctly you provided significant input).  I hope this is helpful.

Stuart

Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.  Concept is fine, 
but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of 
a draft confirm that we use with TVA.

Any way you think Andrew might like power trading?  His resume looks strong.  

Thanks for resending message.  I look forward to playing later in December

Yeah  - go ahead and see if he wants a challenging position in a rewarding 
place.
Thanks

absolutely.  see you on sat around 530.

ps - wildfires not just there - I've heard as well over here.  
Congratulations

I'm not sure about Sat - Grant has been trying to get a sitter - he called 
Lynne and Cecilia.  Are you going?

Hi

Thanks for the good news - It pleases me to know end to be creating EEI 
babies throughout the world - bandwidth is also using it. Hooray
Brenda should have sent a presentation I did that summarizes EEI - Hope its

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya

Thanks,

So far, Ella has been pretty immune to Barbie (Sam on the other hand is 
fascinated - his doctor chastised him for staring  in the Dr office) - she 
wants an angel puppet, a doll and a car for xmas.  If she asked I would 
likely give her some barbiesque items  for the reasons you stated (she's 
going to get them from somebody someday).

FYI  - I wanted you to know that, despite all appearances, we are working on 
finalizing Shari's move to Portland.  Shari is looking for a "relocation" 
package.  HR has been tied up in PRC and is now searching for a package that 
works.   HR has promised me a response today and then I can discuss w Mark H 
and then present to Shari. End of Feb is still the target date.  

Hope all well (despite the press).

Hi Shari

I need help as well from JS on those two issues.  On the LDC supply we need 
to understand the relationship between SD Warren, the LDC and NEPOOL - f/m 
and supply obligation will be impacted but I don't know how until we 
discuss.  Also need to understand the possible penalties from taking from 
LDC.  CMS assignment of load I also need to understand - I think it relates 
to getting the necessary NEPOOL credit but? .. I put a call into JS

EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a 
floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently 
provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is 
otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is 
addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract 
for financial trading, there is included as a MDE "the imposition of trading 
limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate".  
What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu 
of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be 
required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price 
would have been without the cap.

I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material 
changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial 
trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap 
on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of 
prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to 
secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time 
that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with 
litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you 
would always settle against the published prices, even if they are 
"artificially" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are 
not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps 
be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they 
will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we 
will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this 
issue.  

Thanks for your thoughts.

Attached is a chart showing how I thought the PGE assignment could work. Let 
me know what else we can do.  Thanks

I think attachment is missing since I didn't get confirm.

Check w genia re paper - I think we have something but is skimpy

You are correct on the facts PGET pays a higher price to Morgan than EES pays 
to PGET - hence the payment to EES

thanks 

we will likely need to simple corporate help as well to work on 
assignments/termination - if possible maybe you could get somebody to assist 
to also be on call.c

As promised.  THANKS

Janice,

Another high priority deal.  The attached proposal is for Western Resources 
in order to cover a short position we have in SPP.  Noone will sell us FLD so 
we are agreeing to a system firm deal with one catch.  Western Resources will 
put in reserve 20-25% of the total deal value in an account.  They will then 
reimburse us  up to the amount in reserve, if they cut us.  I have tried to 
lay out as muck detail in the attachment as possible.  This deal would need 
to be closed by Jan 1.  Let me know if we need to meet on this and I will get 
someone from the desk to come along.  I will call you to follow up on this.  
Thanks.

Calling brokers to find out what prices would have been is an impossible 
task.  I agree with your assessment.  Unfortunately, caps are not disruptions 
but have become a normal course of business.

EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a 
floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently 
provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is 
otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is

of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be 
required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price 
would have been without the cap.

I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material

Calif. utilities risk imminent default, S&P warns
(UPDATE: Recasts, adds details, background. Adds byline)

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern =
California Edison are at grave risk of default and bankruptcy within =
weeks, and are likely to see their high credit ratings fall to low junk =
grades if they do not get regulatory help by Friday, credit rating agency =
Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday.

``S&P is prepared to take dramatic rating action,'' said Richard Cortright,=
 an S&P analyst, in a conference call. ``The ratings are expected to drop =
deeply into speculative grade to reflect the likelihood of imminent =
default.''

The agency assessed the situation as the California Public Utilities =
Commission prepared to meet Thursday to consider whether to allow Pacific =
G&E and Southern California Edison to pass on at least some of their =
skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs to consumers.

Shares of PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG - news), the parent of Pacific G&E, closed =
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $20-15/16, down $1-7/16, or =
6.42 percent. Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), the parent =
of Southern California Edison, closed at $17-7/8, down $1-1/8, or 5.92 =
percent.

The utilities operate under a rate freeze through March 2002, and are also =
unable to negotiate long-term supply contracts. These factors expose them =
to the vagaries of the volatile spot power market.

Wholesale power recently cost more than $1,400 per megawatt hour, a more =
than 40-fold increase over the $35 per megawatt hour rate last year.

California imposed the rate freeze as part of its deregulation of the =
utilities sector, which was intended to promote competition and consumer =
choice.

Among the options the commission has to remedy the situation are a hike in =
the utilities' price caps.

Even that, however, would constitute a ``band-aid on a bullet wound,'' =
said Ron Barone, who leads S&P's utility group and also participated in =
the conference call.

Californians have already been warned to cut back their energy use, and =
that they may be subject to rolling blackouts.

Cortright said unless the commission offers the utilities significant =
regulatory relief, Pacific G&E and Southern California Edison will be =
dependent on the capital markets for cash infusions, if any are available.

``There are bills that are coming due in January and February,'' he said. =
``We would be naive to think that the capital markets are going to open =
their doors to satisfy (their needs) in the current environment.''

``To be frank,'' he added, ``we are amazed that events have been permitted =
to reach anywhere near this critical stage. It truly is unfathomable. We =
really do need some emergency actions taken now.''

Pacific G&E last completed a big bond sale in October, selling $1.35 =
billion of bonds. Southern California Edison and its parent, Edison =
International, sold an equivalent amount in early November.

Both companies carry ``A-plus'' corporate credit ratings and ``single-A'' =
senior unsecured debt ratings. Pacific G&E's secured debt carries an =
``AA-minus'' rating. Those ratings are considered mid to high investment =
grades.

One trader said Southern California Edison's debt began on Tuesday being =
quoted by price, like junk bonds, instead of by the extra yield they offer =
relative to similar maturity U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.

Its 5.875 percent notes maturing in September 2004 were quoted Wednesday =
at about 87 cents on the dollar, yielding about 11.3 percent to maturity. =
No price quotation was immediately available on Pacific G&E's debt.=20

We are fine with Nolan's changes.

Please note one additional change: Exhibit B, Item 1, the "Confirmation
Number" should be corrected to read 403862.

To complete this transaction, the following needs to happen:

1.Enron needs to sign off on our's and Avista's changes and add the correct
references in the second to last "WHEREAS".

2.Enron and PGET (Dan Sarti) need to finalize the Enron payment amount under
Section 7.

3.PGET (Dan Sarti) needs to provide our wiring instructions for Section 7.

4.Avista needs to provide its wiring instructions for Section 8.

I will be checking voice mails and, later this afternoon, will check
e-mails, should you have any questions.

Peter Meier
We have received a copy of PG&E's comments.  For the most part, we accept
the language.  Only two small modifications:

Change #1: Page 2....second full paragraph.  Replace the word "refund" with
"return."

Change #2: Page 6...last paragraph.  After PGET's wording (which is okay
with us), insert the following: "The return of AVISTA Collateral by PGET to
AVISTA shall be deemed to be a condition precedent to the consent of AVISTA
herein."

Other than that....we're okay with all other language.  I'd be interested in
seeing Enron's comments to PGET's version, as well as this revised version
by Avista.

Attached are my preliminary comments on legal matters.  While I have
attempted to reflect the business deal as I know it, I have not had an
opportunity to consult fully with my client, so I reserve our rights to make
further changes.

Peter

PG&E National Energy Group and any other
company referenced herein that uses the PG&E name or
logo are not the same company as Pacific Gas and
Electric Company, the regulated California utility.  Neither
PG&E National Energy Group nor these other
referenced companies are regulated by the California Public
Utilities Commission.  Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Company
do not have to buy products from these companies in order
to continue to receive quality regulated services from the utility.

Hi David

FYI - Janice is out until the 22nd of Jan. so when you are finished with 
comments, please send them to me as well.  As soon as we have the "live" deal 
give me a call and we will see who has availability to assist you.

REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm "as is."  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.

To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

Notwithstanding the contents of Confirmation Number _____, and to clarify

Per the request of Elizabeth Sager, I have attached Enron's latest comments 
to the Settlement Agreement and a Cover Memo outlining Enron's changes to the 
agreement.  Let's try to speak early tomorrow AM to discuss any outstanding 
issues necessary.

Thanks,

REGARDING THE SETTLEMENT, ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

Tracy Ngo correctly pointed out volumetric ambiguities on the two original
confirmations between Avista Energy and PG&E Energy Trading.

Let me summarize below:

(1) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 404335 showed Total Volume
of 982,400 MWh's.  PG&E revised the Total Volume to 981,600 MWh.  Avista did
not respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.  Our records show
that the original volume of 982,400 is correct (there was a leap-year day in
year 2000).  The broker confirm and the PG&E revision seem to be both in
error.  Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy and
Enron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.  Since this
Assignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommends
language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email from
Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&E and
Enron? Please advise.

(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a Total
Volume of 14,400.  PG&E accepted the confirm "as is."  The broker
confirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.  Therefore, both
PG&E and AVISTA screwed up.  HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh's
should correctly be as per the broker confirmation.  Again, our counsel
recommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see
email from Blair Strong below).  Will this sort of revision be acceptable to
PG&E and Enron?  Please advise.

To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enron
and Avista.  Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron's
confirm's prevail).  Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.  We
would like to see those confirms in advance if possible.

Lastly, time is of the essense.  We are scheduling power already for January
deliveries....therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as to
prevent any problems with scheduling, etc.  I suppose that we could delay
the start dates to February 1st, 2001 if necessary.  Perhaps not a big
issue.

Thanks,
Nolan Steiner

A footenote to be added to Item 1 and Item 2 of Exhibit B

Notwithstanding the contents of Confirmation Number _____, and to clarify
any ambiguity, the Parties agree that the total volume that Avista agreed to
sell to PGET and PGET agreed to purchase from Avista during the Term of the
Confirmation was _______megawatt hours.

Please deliver to Peter ASAP thanks

I think it would be better in a side letter so as not reinvovle Avista at 
this point and raise any new issues - is that ok

Thanks again for all your help

Hi I am here.  We are closing tonight.  Call when you can.Thanks

Here are the revised documents that we will need EEMC to sign.  Please

FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction 
that are being sent out for signature tonight.  Thanks for everybody's help 
in getting this done.  I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713 
853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.   
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing 
to all parties.

Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE 
NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.  Also PGET must release cash 
collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.

Thanks again.

Hi Angela

Sorry I did not get back in touch w you earlier - my mom passed away over the

be back (definitely out the week of 15th).   I look forward to playing and 
will call you when I get back to play.

Dear Chris, 

As discussed with my colleague Tracy Ngo, attached please find a draft 
agreement which would cover the proposed arrangement between EPMI, MEGA and 
PGET. It is in a form acceptable to both PGET and EPMI. If the arrangement is 
to go ahead, please give me any comments from your attorneys ASAP.  Also, if 
it goes ahead, we will need to know the details of the master agreement 
between MEGA and PGET, and receive a copy of the relevant transaction 
confirmation. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. 

Sincerely,

Shari Stack

Andy 

Sorry to get back to you so late - I've been out of town and will be out all 
this week as well.  A meeting on  14th/15th in DC would be great for me.  
Just let me know.  If you need to reach me this week - just leave me a voice

for the existing accrued, but not yet paid, amount of the Negative CTC 
Receivable (but not any future amounts).  There are a few items in brackets

received an e-mail from Shari that she had sent that on to MEGA.  The one 
item in particular that we should dsicuss there is which way the "true up" 
payments will need to move, based upon the different values of the 
transactions involved.  Please call me if you have any questions.  John

  Dear Elizabeth,

Please find attached the draft form termination letter, coupled with a Notice 
of Settlement Amount, that you requested.  Please note that we recommend that 
these form letters be used merely as guides as the contracts that Enron has 
entered into with the PG&E entities all provide for varying procedures for 
termination.  Therefore, each contract should be referenced prior to sending 
out a termination letter.

Additionally, Jim Huemoeller and I believe that it would be best that one 
person be responsible for preparing the various terminations, or in the 
alternative, have such person review each termination letter so that there is 
consistent wording and so that the Enron and LeBoeuf persons responsible for 
monitoring the PG&E situation are certain which contracts are being 
terminated.

Please let us know if you have any questions, or if we can be of further 
assistance.

Best regards,

Christina L.C. McDonald

more smoothly.
New Brunswick Power
Green Mountain Power
Central Vermont PUblic Service Company
Northeast Utilities (agent for CP&L, Western Mass, etc.)
Bangor Hydroelectric Company

As you know, I've already gotten some of the wheels rolling on these 
counterparties, but the work isn't finished yet on any of them.  And Green 
Mountain just filed a new tariff.  Is this something that I could ask Marcus 
to work on with me?  (I understand from Genia that he's now in our group and 
is looking for work.)  Thanks.

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving 
PG&E's recent reorganization.  Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is 
attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy.  I'm wondering 
if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the 
event of a bankruptcy.

John, thanks for the update. I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis 
this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current 
terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent 
that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK 
with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. 
This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated 
acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure 
that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on 
point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please 
ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available 
to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of 
days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all 
internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of 
you if he needs to.  

Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to 
"Regional Management" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and 
Trading. 

Thanks and good luck!

All:

As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with 
Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their 
wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in 
the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are 
currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.  
They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, 
there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items 
and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the 
negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an 
example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine 
PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract 
within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm 
pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for 
about 2-3 hours).

Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:

Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood
Legal:  Janice Moore
Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti
Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson
Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo

Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items 
subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is 
prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a 
chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 
28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you 
all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move 
quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with 
CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on 
outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to 
call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 
3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to 
date.  Thanks.

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
60-day notice period.

I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.

Does this answer some of your questions?
California PUC Adopts DWR Regulations, Re-Regulates Utility Generation
DWR power to go only to SCE and PG&E customers, for now
Obligates SCE and PG&E to make DWR whole for its unrecovered costs
Re-regulates all generation retained by the 3 IOUs
Each to file cost-based rates
Rate base to be net depreciated book value, less recovered stranded costs
The California PUC adopted emergency regulations for the delivery and
payment mechanisms the state*s Department of Water Resources (DWR) will use
in fulfilling its electric purchase and sale obligations under emergency
bill AB 1X.  Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently had
confidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires the
DWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customers
of Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).
Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costs
of its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only an
allocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUC
recognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered at
certain times.  The PUC makes SCE and PG&E liable to pay any shortfalls to
ensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, but
suggests it is open to further consideration of this policy.
URG Assets Re-Regulated
The PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings to
establish cost-based rates for their URG.  The rate set will be made
retroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generation
into to the PX, which SCE and PG&E said they stopped doing on 12/28/00.  The
two utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-ahead
markets on 01/19/01.
The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-related
revenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition Cost
Balancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.  The TCBA reflects the net book
value of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets*
stranded costs.  The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandum
account the difference between this reduced rate of return component of
revenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for the
same assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.  The
amounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference between
their current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had these
generation costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemaking
in place prior to restructuring.*  The cost-based rates so determined, the
PUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just and
reasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment.
The PUC decides that SCE, PG&E, and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) should
use their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1)
serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell power
at cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3)
sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.  The PUC
directs that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered to
other California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefit
in-state ratepayers.  URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-term
purchased power contracts.
Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sell
all of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all of
their energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sell
requirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricing
their retained generation.  In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because of
the need to protect the public interest during this time of nearly
continuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction.
The PUC makes SDG&E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUC
does not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&E, at this time.
The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&E*s retail customers from receiving DWR
power, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.

In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end the
rate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis for
ending the rate freeze.  As far as it addresses the pricing and use of
utilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis for
pricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to their
customers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.

Residual Pricing of DWR Power
Because of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUC
adopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as a
percentage of what each SCE and PG&E retail end use customer currently pays
them for energy.  The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen at
different levels for each utility and each customer class.  The percentage
is calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR and
delivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated or
purchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).  The amount of
power purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others for
resale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market.
This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily.
The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases
750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a total
of 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their rates
for the power they used that day.
Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR and
hold the amounts in trust for DWR.
As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on the
basis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, while
calculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retail
customers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s costs
to be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for each
MWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges.
The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in the
recovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the State
recover the funds expended.*  If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankrupt
utilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, these
amounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid,
overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated.
Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power upon
resale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs,
transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less any
overpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers.
Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain title
to its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, and
reminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit nor
the taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the payment
for any obligation.*  The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities to
deliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take no
ownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrative
capacity as billing agents for DWR.
The PUC*s interim order is posted on its web site at:
http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/FINAL_DECISION/4867.htm
For your convenience, attached is an MS Rich Text Format file containing
this analysis and full summary.

emergency regulations on the delivery and payment mechanism for DWR power
and directing utilities on the use and pricing of utility retained
generation on January 31, 2001, in SCE and PG&E*s consolidated rate
stabilization cases, Application numbers 00-11-038 and 00-11-056, of which
SDG&E is a party.

Dave and Ed,

We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following 
comments on our standard confirms. 

Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was 
that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the 
option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of 
50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks guys.

David,

TVA's proposed credit assurance language should be amended to reflect our 
standard language with the downgrade event being established at BBB- or 
Baa3.  Also, your redline should also delete any subjectivity which provides 
the TVA the unilateral right to call for additional or replacement 
collateral.  In looking at historical agreements (i.e. master options 
agreement), our standard credit provisions have been accepted.  I will 
forward another email with their prefered gty form.  It appears that we 
currently have outgoing gtys; however, they govern certain agreements like 
the Master Options Agmt.  Comments or questions, please call.

Dave and Ed,

We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following 
comments on our standard confirms. 

Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was 
that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the 
option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of 
50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks guys.

-Joe

Harlan - Dede is out this week - how about I take everybody out for lunch on 
Tuesday and we can figure out what to do for speech.  In the meanwhile, I'm 
going to give ISDA the charts we used at last ISDA meeting for distribution 
and Dede is going to get copies of various US agreements to ISDA.

Let me know of Tuesday works or if not other open day.

Also, throughout the PPA I asked you to add comments or clarify a few

tommorrow to discuss (leave me a message tonight and I will come in early to 
read before we meet).  I didn't bother with the Green Sharing Agreement since 
we have not completed going through it with Wind.

Thanks, - Mike

Hi John

Thanks for the  offer but despite what you say, your legal prowess is still 
far more important to me - I would likely have ceased working long ago w/out  
LLGM.  I rode up on the elevator with Jeff Skilling and he asked me if I 
still liked my job.  I first asked if I had a choice and then confessed it 
could be better.  I don't think I won many points with him, particularly when 
I asked him if he liked his job.  Oh well, any connections there?

I'm sending out documents tonight on the utility exposure by confirm to you 
and Jim.  I can talk to you and Jim about that as well as offset with the 
commandeered positions anytime on Wed morning.  Let me know what time works 
for you.

Richard just told me that we settled PCA.  That's great news but I will miss 
the opportunity to work with you.  Thanks for all your help on this matter 
and I hope we get to work together again on some other matter in the near 
future.

I don't know much but I think Dan Lyons is well versed on this.  Also maybe 
Dale R in Portland.  Hope all is well.

I'm open all day

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT INFORMATION
NOT DISCOVERABLE

Two years after PCA's bankruptcy, we received a demand letter from PCA.  PCA 
claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's 
wrongful termination of transactions in June 1998.  This amount appears to be 
based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, 
and certain "preference payments" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.  This 
claim is in its preliminary stages.  I will update you with further 
information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really 
seeking.  As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending 
against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable 
amount.

Bill

In connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have 
someone gather the following information:

1.  Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net 
amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April 
deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we 
received from PCA would have been around May 20th).

2.  Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.

3.  The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated 
transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 1998 you had 
calculated the MTM as of July 7, 1998 at $3,772,939)

As always, thanks for your help.

I sadly will not make dinner on Wed.  Brenda Whitehead should have sent 
updated bio but by copy of this I will ask her to resend.  Thanks

Hopefully this will get to you.  I've already faxed the document to you also.

Purchase of flat screen approved.  I will notify Janette.

I understand that the procedure for getting a flat screen is to request, 
possibly plead, although not confirmed, with your supervisor and if he/she 
agrees, to send a copy of the email to Janette Elbertson, who will then 
permit the release of a flat screen to such poor wretched individuals.
 
Following the above procedure, please could I have a flat screen? At the 
moment I have borrowed one as the procedure stalled at the first hurdle last 
time due to "masterly inaction".

Here it is!!!

Bruce and Mike:

Attached please find the most recent versions of the Frontera Energy 
Marketing Services Agreement and the companion Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  Eric and Frank asked that I forward these to you.  Please be 
advised that these are still under review at TECO, but reflect the most 
recent discussions concerning this arrangement.

You will note that I have made some changes to the Master Power Purchase and 
Sale Agreement to reflect the relationship being established under the Energy 
Services Agreement and to harmonize the terms of that agreement with the 
overall business relationship being established.  Please recognize that there 
are likely to be further revisions following additional review.

I look forward to concluding this arrangement in the next several days.

GREAT NEWS

** PRIVATE **

Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, 
I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that 
prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the 
end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the 
issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our 
consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to 
modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and 
that we could then "compare notes."  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron 
Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly 
quickly.

Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to 
accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects 
CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability 
to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or 
regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to 
a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to 
be characterized as a "default" (which should not be a problem from our 
standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., 
in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely 
affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law 
that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the 
CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the 
hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a 
FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he 
did say that CDWR might entertain a "no LD walk right" for EPMI if such a 
change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will 
back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is 
heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying 
LDs.

Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option.  
With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was 
discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk 
from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a 
date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as 
possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) 
(our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA 
Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were 
issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI 
would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment 
grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date.

Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 
days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is 
sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the "bond guys" are already 
nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the 
LDs).

Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I 
requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend 
perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other 
events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with 
us on that.

Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an 
event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having 
a Downgrade Event a "no LD walk right" for EPMI and perhaps an event 
justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event 
would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would 
be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog 
also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit 
Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event 
that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the 
Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without 
LDs.

Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not 
be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a 
Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like 
to discuss that further with CDWR.

LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would 
accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency 
among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more "objective."  My 
sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general.

Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the 
following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort 
actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, 
holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was 
made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs 
issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political 
environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that 
this is not a "deal breaker" for CDWR.

Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this 
issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue 
as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if 
assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our 
reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we 
said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult 
sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the 
assignment standards are in the other deals.

New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges 
was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad.  
Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di 
agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it 
was fair for us to be protected from that.

Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would 
be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not 
they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility 
that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so 
we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins.  
Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to 
extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that 
before our walk right expires.

Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we 
have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed 
internally with CDWR.

Pro Rata "Spread" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of 
amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would 
run it by CDWR.

CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it 
plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request 
for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted 
information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things 
start to fall into place.

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

John

My goldfish died this weekend - He was with us for over 6 months.  A trusted 
companion for me in the early morning as he sang sweet "O's", he looking for 
food and me looking for peace of mind early in the morning before the days' 
voices began.  

Another day today looks like another week which is how this whole past month 
feels.  Hopefully this to will pass.

Looking forward to talking to you soon and seeing you in early April.

ps - Great work on WAPA;  I get the distinct sense that no matter what, CDWR 
will close.   I hear Skilling told Portland that he loves trading and 
promises resources.  Oh my.

Anything I can do?

To All:

We will hold a meeting of the contract working group at EEI's offices on 
October 9, 2000 from 10am to 4pm.  Lunch will be provided.  We tried to 
schedule a meeting around Power Markets 2001, but EEI does not have space 
available for a large group that week.  A detailed agenda will be sent out 
before the meeting.

If anyone still wants to advise the drafting committee about issues they want 
to address, please do so.  It would be helpful for the drafting committee to 
see what customized terms are being added to your cover sheets.  Please 
forward them to me if you want to help us.  Enjoy the rest of your Summer!

All:

Here is a rough first cut at a DASH for a potential deal with NSTAR to serve 
their Default Service.  Jim/Zach - please fill in all relevant numbers 
relating to volume/pricing, etc.   Also - please begin to get RAC in the loop 
with respect to this position and VaR impacts, etc.  Others - please review 
pertinent sections and edit/expand as appropriate.

Timing on this will likely be quick from this point and thus I would like to 
try to have a completed draft by COB today or first thing tomorrow.  We have 
a call with NSTAR tomorrow AM to negotiate the contract, and assuming all 
goes well there, we could be asked to sign a binding agreement by as early as 
Wednesday.

Please call me to discuss.  978-449-9936.  Thanks

I haven't stopped crying since I got your email .. Of course I've been crying 
everyday, several hours a day for months now, so it is hard to tell whose to 
blame .... You are welcome as always to come by anytime to watch the tears 
(maybe you will happen upon another fine hour like when I accidentally killed

Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying 
off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly 
decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe 
harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.

Hope all is well.

John:  as per your request, attached are revised drafts of the Confirmation 
and Cover Sheet, which are blacklined against the respective documents from 
the short-term deal.  I recognize that you are still reviewing certain 
questions/points with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this 
draft that neither you nor CDWR has "signed off" on.  Nonetheless, in certain 
cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language 
on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may 
be proposing on a particular item.

Please note, in particular, the following:

--on the LD calculation, we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining 
multiple market quotes, etc.  However, after talking to Enron this evening, 
we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the 
parties' good faith efforts to do so, then only in that circumstance would 
the calculation be based on the Non-Defaulting Party's losses.  While, based 
on the product Enron is selling, we anticipate that quotes will be readily 
obtainable, we think it makes sense to revert to the Non-Defaulting Party's 
loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable 
despite using all efforts to do so.  I know that you expressed some 
reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject 
to some manipulation.  This is not so.  If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and 
it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron, such dispute would become the 
subject of arbitration.  In such case, the Non-Defaulting Party's would have 
to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case.  Since 
those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading 
positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and 
such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and 
other relevant financial information, etc. that becomes, in part, part of its 
SEC filings, in a discovery proceeding this information would be very 
transparent.

--with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding, Enron strongly 
believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a 
neutral site.  The draft provides for New York City, although Enron is open 
to other possible locations.

--the revised draft reflects only the $127/MWh alternative scenario since you 
indicated that, preliminarily, you felt that CDWR would not be likely to 
choose the alternative structure we had discussed.

--we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal 
regulatory change.  I'm sure you can appreciate this in light of the current 
environment, although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral 
contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed.  
Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs, but would like to further 
discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major 
adverse federal development affecting the contract.

--we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend 
performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event.  However, we think it is 
appropriate that if that circumstance occurs, that the due date for payments 
by CDWR should shorten to 7 days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded 
that the payment schedule would revert accordingly.

--you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a Non-Defaulting 
Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting 
Party.  We included a 60-NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft.  
This is important to Enron as we discussed, particularly in light of Enron's 
acceptance of the 180 day period on the timing of a Termination Payment 
which, as you know, is unheard of in the power sale (or virtually any other) 
arena.  (Nonetheless, we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond 
people on this point).

--on assignment, the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a pre-approved 
right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs.  As we discussed, it may 
very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected 
that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those 
counter parties.  It can't be in a position where such an assignment could 
cause it to violate those limits.

--we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go 
forward of the first to occur of (1) September 30, 2001 or (2) seven days 
after the Bonds are issued.  You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to 
consider such an "outside date" as long as (i) the $127/MWh pricing was in 
effect from April 1 and (2) Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are 
issued.  We have proposed 7 days for this.

--in concept, we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a 
credit rating for the Fund (as opposed to the Bonds), although we have 
referred that question to the credit people to make sure.

--in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside 
counsel, we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be 
from the AG, or if CDWR cannot do that, then from the GC of CDWR.  We felt 
that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be 
rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally 
would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued.

I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed.  Please 
let me know when you wish to discuss.  Also, it may make sense for our next 
call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since 
it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be 
commercial ones.

Lastly, please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed 
in the revised drafts with Enron, in order to expedite the process, we are 
sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron.  Thus, it is possible 
that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents.

Thanks.  We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite 
documents.

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the "trade options exemption" and as to the 
parties being "eligible swap participants" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

John:  Following up on your voice mail, attached are revised drafts of the 
Confirm and the Master Agreement.  Please note that, as you may recall, 
Elizabeth Sager is out of town today and I have not been able to catch up 
with her to get her views on the things set forth in your e-mail to me, or 
with Christian.  However, we had a brief conversation after our call 
yesterday about some of the points on your "list" and I have tried to 
generally work with what you have proposed on a few of the points in light of 
my conversations with Elizabeth and Christian.  Since I have to leave the

Hi Harlan

Hope your enjoying your fortuitous timing - since you've been gone we haven't 
seen below triple digits and there is no relief in site.  In that vain, I'd 
love nothing more than to pull you back for nothing less than an Into 
meeting.  I spoke w Kevin Presto, head of East trading, and he has proposed 
that we all get together no earlier than the end of next week, with 
afternoons and Tues or Thurs being the best days.  He would propose that he, 
Rogers Herndon and John Zufferli attend.  Let me know what days would work 
for you.

Happy trails

Here are proposed responses to these discovery requests:

Request for Admission - Admit that CPSC agreed to go forward with the 
transaction proposed in the July 30, 1999 letter absent a guarantee from 
CPSC's parent company.

Answer:  EPMI objects to this request in that it is vague and ambiguous, 
particularly in its use of the term "agreed to go forward."  Subject to and 
without waiving this objection, EPMI denies this request.

Interrogatory - If your answer to the preceding request for Admission is 
other than an unqualified admission, state in detail the basis for your 
denial or qualification of the admission.

Answer:  EPMI objects to this interrogatory for the reasons stated in its 
response to the preceding request for admission.  Subject to and without 
waiving this objection, EPMI states that CPSC made no apparent effort to seek 
LCRA's consent to an assignment as contemplated by the July 30, 1999.  In 
telephone conversations in the late afternoon of the last day for the parties 
to have entered into such an assignment pursuant to the terms of the July 30, 
1999 letter agreement (which conversations were initiated by EPMI several 
days earlier) CPSC indicated that it would begin to negotiate an assignment 
without a parent guarantee, but CPSC did not, in fact, agree to an assignment 
before the expiration of the time period contemplated by the July 30, 1999 
letter agreement.  After that time had expired, CPSC did not continue 
negotiations with EPMI.
Let me know what you think.

David and Elizabeth,

Here are the redlined versions of the NSP amendments.  The changes are 
straight forward.  The only thing that I found was that they only changed the 
date in one of the agreements...they should probably be changed in both.  
Please review and resend to me at your earliest convenience.  Our goal is to 
execute tomorrow.

Thanks,

Terri

this made me think of you...

  All in good humor:
  A man in a hot air balloon realized he was lost.  He reduced
altitude and spotted a woman below.  He descended a bit more and shouted,
"Excuse me, can you help me?  I promised a friend I would meet him an hour
ago, but I don't know where I am."
  The woman below replied, "You are in a hot air balloon
hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground.  You are between 40 and 41
degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude."
  "You must be an engineer," said the balloonist.
  "I am," replied the woman.  "How did you know?"
  "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is
technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information,
and the fact is I am still lost.  Frankly, you've not been much help so
far."
  The woman below responded, "You must be a manager."  "I am,"
replied the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
"Well," said the woman, "you don't know where you are or where you are
going.  You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air.
You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to
solve your problem.  The fact is you are in exactly the same position you
were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault."

Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship 
between TVA transmission and marketing.  N

 I will call you later to discuss TVA letter. Kevin does not want to make 
offer to sell at market based rates.  Also want to discuss if there is any 
way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week.

Talk to you soon.

Thanks

ES--Bob Madden may be interested in this.  If TVA is not formally separated, 
then TVA control area saying it will not retag when EPMI changes the source 
(from ENSE to AEP, for example) and TVA marketing not taking us as an 
upstream if we do that are really interconnected.  Maybe Bob can come up with 
something.

Bill--Does TVA ever buy transmission on any other TP's system?  It must not 
or it would have to file it Practices as a OATT with FERC.  Does TVA just buy 
or sell at its border?  Thanks.

Calpine says PG&E in breach of power contracts
(UPDATE: updates with company comments to analysts)
SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 (Reuters) - Independent power company Calpine Corp. 
(NYSE:CPN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cpn&d=t> - news </n/c/cpn.html>) said 
on Monday that bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and Electric was in breach of 
contract after failing to make some $267 million in payments and it would 
seek prompt court action to secure payment or be freed from its energy 
contracts.
ADVERTISEMENT  
<http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6

<http://rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=7811756:LREC/A=6
31358/R=0/*http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html >
``Right now there is breach of contract'' for power Calpine has provided 
Pacific Gas and Electric, Calpine senior vice president Lisa Bodensteiner 
told an analysts teleconference. 
``We are filing motions this week with the bankruptcy court to direct PG&E to 
pay us. If it doesn't decide this, we will then ask the court to relieve of 
us of our contacts and let us sell to the open market,'' she said. 
San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine said in a statement earlier Monday it was 
confident PG&E would be able to pay Calpine's 11 qualifying facility 
subsidiaries (QFs) for past-due power sales. 
Calpine's 11 QF plants, which generate around 600 megawatts of power from 
small natural gas-fired and geothermal plants, are part of a fleet of 
qualifying facilities that can produce up to about a third of all the power 
generated in California. 
As of March 31, Pacific Gas and Electric owed a total of $643 million for 
power the QFs have supplied to its customers, according to the California 
Public Utilities. 
PG&E must assume Calpine's contracts in its bankruptcy proceedings for them 
to continue, Calpine said. 
PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news 
</n/p/pcg.html>) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest 
inverstor-owned utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday 
after piling up around $9 billion in wholesale power costs it has not been 
able to recover due to California's 1996 deregulation legislation. 
Calpine senior vice president Jim Macias told analysts that if PG&E ``were 
dumb enough'' not to affirm the contracts, Calpine could make an extra $380 
million selling the energy tied up in its QF contracts with PG&E on the open 
spot market. 
``We are in constant discussions with state municipal utilities and the state 
to sell our power. We are very confident we will be able to move this energy 
should the contacts be rejected,'' Macias said. 
He estimated spot electricity prices in the state are currently about $260 
per megawatt hour. 
A Calpine spokeswoman said Monday the company's QF facilities operated when 
California declared power emergencies, but could not comment on whether they 
operate when an alert is not called. 
In addition to the $267 million currently owed, San Francisco-based Calpine 
also holds a long-term $68 million note receivable with PG&E for energy 
deliveries from 2003 to 2014, but that the note is note yet due. 
Calpine, which said it did not expect the $267 million PG&E owes it to grow, 
said the utility had paid 15 percent of what PG&E owes it for energy 
delivered in December and January, but had not paid anything since. 
Calpine, which has its own natural gas storage reserves in Sacramento, 
Calif., also said it expected to make payments to its gas suppliers. 

great - here is brochure.  I will try to get list of attendees so we can see

To all:

I've put together a slide presentation that can be used for the 10am (Let's 
Make a Deal), 11:15 (When the Deal Does Not Go Down); 1:30 (Show Me the 
Money); and 2:30 (Major Meltdowns) panels.  Please feel free to edit, 
supplement, comment or suggest alternatives.  I am assuming that Harlan and 
Elizabeth will have other handouts for the 8:30am panel.  Mike Small's 
handout is attached.  I also plan to add:  the model tariff and service 
agreement, slides concerning the EEI contract development process, a page 
showing the location of the eei contract website, and list of upcoming 
activities.  Please let me know if there is anything else you think should be 
added as a handout (preferably something that does not need to be created 
from scratch).

Patty, in addition to the attached slides, Bob Viola said he was comfortable 
with using John Varholy's presentation, but wants to discuss further.  I've 
asked Marvin Goldstein if he intends to use his forward contract and 
bankruptcy memo for his presentation.   Its attached.  Shari Stack said she 
will finish up her presentation and send it to you  today.  Contact info for 
your panels:  Bob Viola 617-912-6256 (rviola@edisonmission.com); Marvin

try and get it, he's on vacation this week.  He did not return a message I 
left yesterday.  David has a conference call scheduled for Friday for his 
panels and hopefully, you can set one up for yours this week.

Dale and Nicole

I unsuccessfully tried to retrieve the document you sent  Can you either 
resend or get me a hard copy.  

Thanks Elizabeth 36349

monday around 10 also works for me

I'll send you the attendees list when I get it from EEI - meetings in the 
West frequently do have many "commercial" folks as well as lawyers and credit 
managers.  It is a great way for the lawyers to network.

for you, anything - I accept

Hi Dede

Hi Sami

Can we get together next week to discuss?  How about Mon at 1030?

Thanks for your message.  Hope all is well.  I don't think I'll be able to 
have dinner on Thurs (Grant is coming) but thanks for the invite. Looking 
forward to seeing you in Newport.

no survey present when I open site - please advice

Ok to incorporate language referring to ERCOT/West product that we trade 
under EEI (West firm should already be handled and ERCOT confirms talk about 
product but without definition).

OK maybe to modify transmission contingent but need to clarify why with 
Harlan and then advice/discuss w traders.  We do not commonly use those 
definitions

Mark

I am not aware of any contracts similar to those described by Sharon.

Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an "Into Product" is 
and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission 
and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.  Attendees from 
Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last 
name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.  If you think somebody 
else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I 
can talk to Harlan.  Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an 
internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet 
with Dynegy.

As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively 
with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product 
is.  Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against 
they way the product ultimately got defined.  Dynegy put on a big dog and 
pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that 
EEI's Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely 
expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are 
making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be 
excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in 
general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another 
interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when 
firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the 
receiving control area).  Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they 
have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go 
physical.  At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in 
firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent 
product.  Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.

I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:

1.  Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition 
- Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.  We 
trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common 
understanding of what we are trading.  Critical to clear up this ambiguity.

2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against 
EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost 
acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice 
against the Into definition.

3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what 
will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is 
such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally 
we all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we 
start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in 
transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may 
want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes 
into an RTO)

Call me with any questions/thoughts.

Thanks

fine with me

After looking at this I realize it may not be as helpful as I thought - 
certainly would need to add more analysis on the delivery obligations like FM 
and other rights to interrupt.  Call if you have any questions (713 853 6349).

ps  if you get a chance I would love to see the form PGE used in addition to 
the WSPP - I think you said it was PGE 11.

Thanks
Have a great weekend.

I'm sorry I thought you might still be here.  I'm travelling the rest of this

Andy,

We still have some internal work to do before we can say whether there is
any chance BPA will use the EEI contract in the future.  Personally, I think
this depends largely on what the prevailing industry trading arrangements
are, and that seems to be the WSPP agreement right now.  But our eyes and
ears are open.  I will be attending the conference and expect it to be very
informative.  Thanks for sending out the brochure.

Gerit Hull

Here's the final conference brochure.  The last panel of the day has a
comparison of the EEI and the WSPP and what the future holds for each.  If
you were inclined, having your thoughts on which agreement the BPA would
likely embrace in the future would be helpful.  If you speak, you get to
attend the entire conference for free.  Also, please feel free to pass the
brochure on to any counterparties in the west that you think would benefit.
FYI, if there is enough interest we can try to arrange getting additional
rooms at the Four Seasons at the conference rate.  If that is not an option,
there is a Mariott that we have a national account w/ that is only 5 minutes
from the Four Seasons.  If we get enough overflow we will guarantee the
Mariott a block of rooms to get a discount rate.  I

Lets do it when you are in Houston on Monday

Hi Mike

Dede and my husband and I are all bringing our racquets hoping to get in some 
tennis on either or both Wed and Thurs? Can you join us?  Let me know.

great 

One hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not 
really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be 
appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently 
make us forget how good life is.  So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday 
morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the 
Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where. After 
trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.  And then it came to me.  An 
epic. A history. A sense of time, commitment and value. A place where my 
roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 
200 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the 
Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).  And of course there is the 
hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in 
the Casino. 

And the Gods must have seen this coming too.  Being meager and always wanting 
to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.  Not to be found.  
Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.  Other than in the 
sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.  I 
knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out 
of my hands.  I fought and won.

I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.  At this rate 
I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.

May Shelby be with us all  providing sustaining .......

I'm sure there's a scholar out there who has already published that big 
magnum opus on "Dogs in the Civil War."  However, Shelby Foote doesn't 
mention a single dog in his work and so the topic hasn't entered my 
imagination.  Your name is Patrick Cleburne.  I'm sorry about the gender 
thing, but your spirit and behavior is the same as his and you're going to 
have to go through this reading cycle bearing my comments about his behavior. 
I'll try to work in some dog analogies if I can.  Cleburne was a German 
Shepherd if there ever was one.  I would have hated to be across that line 
looking at his formation over there.   ----cgy

Christian,

Isn't there some canine hero/heroine that is mentioned in one of the history 
books?  I would prefer waging the battle as a four-legged soldier, North or 
South it doesn't matter, we are here just to serve our Masters.

Awaiting my name

One hundred and forty two years ago today, the great great great grandfather 
of Stacy Dickson, a guy named Edmond Ruffin, when other sober minded men held 
back, stepped up to touch a burning torch to a big cannon pointed across the 
Charleston harbor at Fort Sumter and touched off the great Civil War. His 
rash temper caused him to play directly into Lincoln's hand and forever after 
it would be said:  "The South started the war."   On this anniversary day, 
Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman energy attorney,  touches off his third 
consecutive reading of Shelby Foote's great American Iliad about that war, 
this reading giving him more sustaining energy to cope with his lacklustre, 
stressful career in the Casino than any other theraputic activity he has yet 
found.   The Civil War imagery and analogies  will be flowing soon.  I see 
Elizabeth as a daughter of old Virginia with the Sager homestead right there 
in the Valley where much of the action took place.  I'm not sure where your 
folks would have fit in Genia, but you will soon be  assigned the proxy name 
I can't think of at the moment, the Irish warrior who fought for the South.  
Unfortunately I am on the North side.  I hope this won't cause serious 
professional difficulties for us as we wade through the epic battles and 
their respective corporate analogies. ----cgy

Hi Carol

My home number is 713 864 4023 - weekends would work fine so give me a call 
any time.  

This heat is unbelievable. I've become weak in body and have recently only 
played inside at the Met - I'm playing this weekend outside for the first 
time in weeks - I'll probably get killed.  Just FYI  I will be out of town 
next weekend but around after that.  Anytime you want to play, just give me a 
call.

Lucky you - as I struggle at my desk dealing with the fallout from extreme 
volatility in Western power prices,  I can think of nothing more pleasant 
then holding a newborn (they never cry and don't eat that much - right?), 
luxuriously watching the drama unfold at the US Open.  Go Davenport.  Lets 
hope Martina fares as well.

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

I'm out this week giving a seminar - the head of the rival power form WSPP 
and me Miss EEI are giving presentations on why our documents are the best.  
Before that though we have tennis scheduled (he'll kill me but I do have the 
better form)  so it looks like we  will have to push it till the week of the 
23rd  Any day that week is good.

Way to go again on your sweet victory this weekend.

Thanks for yesterday - It's a wonderful tradition that I look forward to 
every year.  Also, I spoke w Pam and does Tues at 700 work for you? Thanks 
again

Thanks for the book and bikes - Ella is in love with the bike with the 
basket.  How about lunch next week?

absolutely - see you at your house as darkness falls

I'm thrilled - see you in Newport (when do you get in?)

how about Wed, April 25th

Thanks for the explanation.  Can you also get the actual interest rate used 
for each group on terminated transactions (eg the financial trades, the power 
trades, the US gas trades and the Canadian gas trades).  Thanks

Pushkar's methodology. Let me know if I can be of further help on this.

The libor curves are calculated using market data at the close of the day for 
swap instruments namely the libor cash rates (published on Telerate page 
3750), eurodollar curve (prices published on Telerate 910) and the swap curve 
(prices published on Telerate 19901). The interpolated spot curve is 
calculated using a boot-strapping methodology. Discount rates can be 
calculated from these published zero rates by using the formula d(t) = 1

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

Attached is a draft letter setting forth Enron's damages in connection with 
the termination of certain commodity forward and swap positions with PG&E.  
In lieu of sending out multiple letters and then aggregating the exposures  
for set off purposes, I thought it would be more understandable if we put all 
the matters in one letter.  For each product line,  I thought we could attach 
all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for 
the court but it seems like the right thing to do). Each commodity line then 
would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter:

1.  Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC
2.  Copy of transaction confirmations
3.  Copy of termination notice sent to PG&E
4.  Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s)
5.  Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same
6.  Chart setting forth termination payment calculation for each terminated 
trade
7.  Paragraph describing methodology used to determine termination payment 
valuation (eg - 4 quotes secured, threw out high and low and averaged middle)
8   List showing quotes secured (entity, person, time and amount) and the 
extent available, written confirmation of such quote

I will be out of the office the rest of this week but will organize a call 
for early next week in order to finalize the PG&E package.

you both informed on the "three strikes" bill and Enron efforts regarding i=
t.
From today's Gas Daily:

=01+Three strikes=01, bill hits California

California Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza,
a Democrat, will introduce a bill today that will
make it a felony for any energy supplier in California
to engage in a conspiracy to drive up prices
or manipulate the market.

The bill would apply to any company selling
gas or electricity into the state or to any of the
state=01,s utilities, said a spokesman for Cardoza.

Under terms of the proposed legislation,
offenders would be subject to California=01,s "three
strikes" law, which sentences convicted felons
to jail for life after three offenses. Directors, officers
or any other employees associated with
market manipulation of a company would be
subject to this bill, the spokesman said.

Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press
conference today at 2 p.m. Pacific time. CD

 No easy solutions to crisis

The crisis in California is far beyond short-term
fixes parading as potential solutions, and
there is no turning back for deregulation in the
state, according to a report released yesterday
by consulting firm Andersen.

California has no choice but to forge ahead in
repairing the damage that ill-planned deregulation
measures have caused, the Energy Crisis in the
Western U.S.: Lessons for navigating regulatory
and market minefields report says. "There=01,s a common
wisdom that knows you can=01,t unscramble the
egg," said Matt Smith, head of Andersen=01,s North
American energy consulting practice. All that can
be done is correct the mistakes, he added.
In addition, steps must be implemented to
prevent the spread of the California "virus" to
other states=01, electricity marketplaces, Smith said.

"To begin, in our view, the energy crisis in the
western U.S. has produced formidable challenges
for utility industry regulators, state and federal
policymakers, and industry executives," Smith said.
"The virus spawned in California requires new strategies
to contain and reverse the damage.

"The implications for the development of
competitive energy markets go far beyond the
western United States. Unfortunately, California
has taught the nation that regulatory and political
barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."

The proposed solutions put in motion by
federal and state regulators, as well as California
policymakers, have only led to an increasingly
uncertain market and tension among those
working for a viable resolution, the report says.

"In reaction to the breakdown, many of
California=01,s political leaders now prefer to abandon
deregulation," the report says.

The report concludes that power shortages
and blackouts are inevitable this summer. The
deregulated marketplace, which took a year to
throw off track, will more than likely take a number
of years to put right, the report says. MCM

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
"didn=01,t see any smoking gun" in either report.

"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies," Campbell=20
said. "I believe FERC
is looking at this situation " and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place."

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. "It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: "There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission."

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

I remember hearing Jeff Rawls' name a few years ago, however I never new him. 
I think he may have worked on the Texas gas desk, probably for Janet Dietrich.

In Carey Jordan's deposition today, he mentioned that Paul Posoli was 
recruited to become employed with Calpine in part because another former 
Enron employee and current Calpine employee named Jeff Rawls recommended 
him.  What, if anything, do you know about Jeff Rawls?

1.? Members of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Subcommittee 
opened? hearings today on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between 
Southern California Edison Company (SCE), Edison International (EIX), and the 
California Department of Water and Power (CDWR).? Testifying on behalf of SCE 
were SCE Vice President Bob Foster and Ann Cohen.? Additional hearings will 
be scheduled next week at which time the subcommittee will hear from 
representatives of the Governor, the Attorney General, and CDWR.? Among other 
things, committee members questioned the wisdom of acquiring the transmission 
system, particularly on an "as is" basis, the price to be paid, alternative 
structures that would not require an acquisition by the state, and the rate 
of return on new investment in the utility. 

2.? Also in Sacramento, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price 
Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market is scheduled to continue its 
investigation Thursday on market manipulation.? 

3.? Governor Davis' representatives have been negotiating a transaction with 
Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the 
utility's transmission assets.? The Governor's representatives expect to have 
an agreement within one to two weeks. 

4.? Also today, Governor Davis announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to 
head a team that will speed the construction of power plants in the state.? 
The "Governor's Generation Implementation Taskforce" will work to bring 
electrical generation facilities on line by coordinating state permitting, 
siting, finance, design, and construction efforts in a "one stop shop." 

5.? At its open meeting this evening, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) approved an order addressing market monitoring and 
mitigation for California wholesale power markets.? Based on the FERC staff 
presentation and discussion during the meeting, it appears that the market 
monitoring and mitigation plan for California includes the following:

(1)? a requirement that all generators which entered into a Participating 
Generator Agreement with the ISO, and all non-public utilities in California 
that sell into the ISO's real-time market or use the ISO transmission grid, 
must offer all available electric capacity during all hours to the ISO 
real-time market, except for hydroelectric units.

(2)? all public utility load serving entities in California must submit 
demand bids in real-time markets during all hours.

(3)? all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the 
FERC to sell power at market-based rates are subject to a refund condition to 
prevent anti-competitive bids into real time markets.

(4)?? the ISO is required to submit weekly reports to the FERC on scheduled 
outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring.

(5)?? all sales into the ISO real-time market during a period of reserve 
deficiency (i.e., during Stage 1, 2 or 3 emergencies) will be subject to 
price mitigation.? The FERC order will include a formula that the ISO will be 
required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such 
sales.

The order will also enhance the ISO's ability to coordinate and control 
planned outages. 

The mitigation plan will be in effect for a one-year period, and will be 
subject to periodic review.? The FERC is also requiring the ISO and the 
investor-owned utilities to submit a filing by June 1, 2001, to form a 
Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).? If an RTO filing is not submitted 
by that date, then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate 
automatically.? The FERC is also directing the parties to work with RTO West 
(an RTO approved for the Pacific Northwest) to develop a plan for including 
California within RTO West, with a goal of ultimately creating one RTO for 
the entire western interconnection.? Finally, the FERC is instituting an 
investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act with respect to 
wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection.? Apparently, 
potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions 
in the western interconnection entered into for a period of 24 hours or less 
and made when reserve deficiencies are 7.5% or less.

FERC also approved the formation of RTO West, an eight-state RTO combining 
the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific Northwest.? The FERC 
asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December 1 of this year on its 
plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its 
operations in a broader regional system. RTO West first submitted its plans 
to the FERC last October. It includes nine electric utilities serving eight 
western states with some 50,000 miles of transmission lines. The nine 
utilities include Avista, BPA, Idaho Power, Montana Power, Nevada Power, 
PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific. 
The states where the RTO West would operate are Washington, Oregon, Idaho, 
Nevada, Utah and parts of Montana, Wyoming and California. 

A more detailed analysis of the FERC orders will be provided in tomorrow's 
update.

Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please 
call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with 
John Klauberg about "East Coast" municipalities to make sure he thinks this 
policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this 
afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial 
trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is 
written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally, 
it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should 
distribute the memo.

Thanks for your fast review.

Larry:  In accordance with our conversation late last week, I am enclosing =
a=20
revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on=20
Wednesday.  My comments primarily involve the following:

(1) As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made sense to specify a=
=20
reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached closure on a=20
settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims.  I =20
proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can=01,t come to an=
=20
agreement in that time period, then the =01&mechanics=018 in the MPA for re=
solving=20
a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be=
=20
=01&reactivated.=018  Obviously, if we are making progress, the parties can=
 always=20
extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to=
=20
make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution=
. =20
Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon, the conditions of the=
=20
extension of the =01&stay=018 would be embodied in the settlement agreement=
 itself =20
(as opposed to this letter).

(2) Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t=
he=20
parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached, and=
=20
that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter.  Thus, the=20
revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the =01&Initial Extensi=
on=20
Period=018 (i.e., to May 25, 2001).  Your draft had provided that Enron wou=
ld be=20
required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b=
e=20
reached.  My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the=20
Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto, if agreed=
=20
to by Enron, should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t=
he=20
parties, rather than as part of this letter.  Also, we note that, as a=20
contractual matter, the MPA does not require the non-defaulting party to ke=
ep=20
in place any security in favor of the defaulting party when, as a result of=
 a=20
termination, the non-defaulting party owes a payment to the defaulting part=
y.=20
 See Sec. 5.5.

(3) Your draft of the letter provided that Enron =01&agrees=018 to enter in=
to new=20
master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on =01&commercially=
=20
reasonable terms.=018  The revised letter specifies that Enron agrees to=20
negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the negotiations=
=20
towards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron=01,s part to ef=
fect=20
a contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as a result of the=20
parties=01, execution of the definitive transaction documents (as opposed t=
o=20
this letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole discretion of eac=
h=20
of the parties.

Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on the foregoin=
g=20
or on the revised letter.  Thanks in advance for your help in moving this=
=20
forward.

FYI.

From Natural Gas Intelligence:

Breaking News : Williams Ordered to Pay $8 Million Refund to Cal-ISO 
posted 10:05 AM (CST) May 1, 2001 

Williams Energy Marketing & Trading has been ordered by FERC to refund $8 
million to the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) and has had a 
"prospective condition" placed on its authority to sell power at market-based 
rates for a year as part of a stipulation and consent agreement.

The agreement, which FERC approved Monday, was in response to a mid-March 
order that directed Williams Energy and AES Southland Inc. to show cause why 
they shouldn't be found in violation of the Federal Power Act (FPA) for 
allegedly engaging in actions that drove up prices in the California bulk 
power market and potentially compromised the reliability of the transmission 
gid. The two companies entered into the agreement with FERC's Market 
Oversight and Enforcement Section to resolve all the issues in the show-cause 
order [IN0I-3-001].

Specifically, the agreement calls for Williams to refund $8 million of the 
$10.85 million in additional revenues it received when two AES generation 
units, designated as reliability must-run (RMR) units, failed to provide 
immediate service to the Cal-ISO in April and May. The ISO was forced to call 
upon other non-RMR units and pay a much higher price (near or at $750/MWh) to 
Williams. Williams is the exclusive marketer for power from the two AES 
plants at issue --- AES Alamitos LLC and AES Huntington Beach LLC in Southern 
California. The Commission also conditioned Williams' market-based authority 
such that it will have to bear the financial cost of replacement power if a 
RMR unit is unavailable at any time over the next year.

Significantly, the agreement does not find that either Williams or AES abused 
their market power in California. It rejected the California Public Utilities 
Commission's request to impose penalties --- over and above refunds --- on 
the companies. Moreover, the agreement does not put an end to the "formal, 
non-public investigation" that FERC ordered in mid-March into violations 
arising out of the conduct of Williams and AES. 

 

Thanks for the invite but I am not coming up until Thurs morning so... maybe 
next year.  See you there.

You vastly overstate my role but  thank you nonetheless.  

As always, an irreplaceable learning experience for me when we are 
communicating. And so, I too, thank you.

Hello, attached below is an example of a monthly option and a daily option.  
The only difference being one is exercised once a month and the other is 
exercised daily.  The times that options are exercised varies by delivery 
point and whether the option is daily or monthly.  We can send you a list of

is it ok for me to give Tracey and Georganne copies of PG&E book?  thanks
Elizabeth,

I work for Georganne and we are trying to find all the pieces in the risk 
books.  It would be very helpful if we could get the appendices that are 
mentioned in the document below.  Could you help me with this?

thanks

Here are the numbers that we need to tie into.

Copy of PG&E letter

Can you please forward a copy of the letter we sent out Tuesday morning to 
Georgeanne Hodges so that she has all of the correct values?  Thanks.

for 1130 - also, wasn't sure it this would work, but Dede and I have talked 
about having one of the pro's in training (Micky) drill us and I spoke with 
him and I think he would be available.  Would you'all like to do that?  Let

Elizabeth:  PG&E cannot accept the added language as you have presented it;
as you well appreciate, it arguably would have the effect of diminishing
PG&E's current rights.  I have accepted your changes and provided a revision
that I think more fairly preserves each party's status quo rights.  Please
keep in mind that PG&E already is agreeing to a modification of the LC
drawing events as an accommodation to Enron.  In light of that and of our
need to cooperate and move forward, I hope you can leave things as they
appear in this revision.  I'll try to call you tomorrow to confirm.  And,
thanks for attending to this.  Larry

Do we need a pre-meeting?   Quite honestly, Dynegy's position is not 
unreasonable - it forces the sinking utility to assume the transmission risk.
I understand the EEI position and long term it is definitely the right answer 
from a liquidity and MTM accounting standpoint and I will clearly support 
that position in our discussions with 3rd parties.

The ultimate goal for ENA is to go away from Into products completely and 
trade power within zones of RTO's or ISO's where transmission and congestion 
is managed by an independent operator with all transmission costs passed on 
to the load.

Chris

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.

and I have been working on. As has been discussed, the Standstill Period

Please review the attached and let me know if this would be OK to execute 
tomorrow and send to PG&E for signature.

and owing from EPMI to NYSEG under the NYSEG Transaction or EPMI shall have 
failed to deliver the Attributes received from NYSEG to EESI, in which case 
EESI shall have a claim against EPMI for the replacement value of the 
Attributes not delivered to EESI)"

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, 
however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least 
mostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 
5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which 
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is 
designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's 
requirements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories 
of requirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business 
participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has 
adoped a "General Commercial Plan" to comply with such requirements, XOM has 
promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  
And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to 
ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in 
business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a "General Commercial 
Plan," so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the 
last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women 
and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under 
this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such 
things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's 
ability to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and 
Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy 
Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, 
but he did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to 
this.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 
5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence "The Federal Contract Supplement is 
attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to 
the extent appplicable."  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, 
but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for 
example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), 
and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small 
business requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on 
this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both 
parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting 
from the "gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its 
managerial and senior supervisory personnel".  You can see the full details 
of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same 
draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round 
and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 
because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver 
applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions 
to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of 
its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to 
the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a 
lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing 
staff to "fudge" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in 
compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were 
the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to 
the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's 
a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn 
off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to 
have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, 
based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to 
no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the 
following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to 
you, now.
 UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST 
PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR 
CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that 
nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's 
liability under Article 10.4(b).  
Let me know if you have any questions about this.  
Regards,
Janice

Hi

Looking forward to seeing everyone - a babysitter for Lucy, Ella and Sam 
sounds great.  Let me know if you need me to do anything.

Hi

Kriste can hit so we are going to try to meet at 12:15.  Can you join us 
late? 

Kriste can hit at 12:15.  Can you join us?

Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to 
talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET 
but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the 
regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will 
call you back.

see you on court 2 at 12:00

Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs 
next week.

On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this 
schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the 
first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?

Hi John

I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an 
assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY 
), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about 
invoicing.  

Janet and Genia

Here is message and info re VEPCO.  Janet can you pick this one up from 
Janice? Genia can you get file from Janice's office and give to Janet?  Thanks

Elizabeth,

Who will be taking over Janice's negotiations with VEPCO?  Their attorney, 
Shelley, called and wanted the new Enron attorney to give her a call.  Her 
number is 804-273-4149.  I apologize that I received this call this morning, 
but am not getting to you until now.

Paul

Hi Paul

 I have asked JANET MOORE to pick this up from Janice.  JANET's number is 
57400.

Carol

Can you sit in on this call with me ?   Thanks

POWER SALES AND TOLLING ARRANGEMENTS
IN TODAY'S MARKET

On Tuesday, June 5, 2001, Baker Botts will be presenting an internal legal
training seminar entitled "Power Sales and Tolling Arrangements in Today's
Market" in the main conference room on the 13th floor of our Washington
office, 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (The Warner).  Bob Bohme, of our Washington
office, will be the speaker for the program.  He will address a number of
drafting and negotiation problems commonly encountered in power sales and
tolling agreements.  Although the program is geared toward lawyers, it may
also be of interest to non-lawyers involved in these negotiations.

Please help me - I can not get access to approve this account.  Why not?  I 
am his supervisor and can get access to others accounts

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
"workathon" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).

Willy and I were thinking we would get a sitter from 5pm-11pm on Saturday
night for Sam , Ella and Lucy. What do you think?? The agency charges a
$ 30.00 flat fee and then anywhere from $10- $15 an hour after that.

Greg and Peter

Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in 
speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I 
think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good 
opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and 
on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input.

FYI

Alice's first day at Enron will be this Friday, June1st. She will be in 
employee training on the following Monday.  Alice will also be supporting 
Harlan Murphy, a new lawyer that will also start on Friday.  Thanks

Thanks for the feed back - it may not have been the same Greg Johnston (she 
said that her Greg had an "e" at the end of his name)

Elizabeth,
Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I 
am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution 
copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the 
contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a 
physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back 
on Monday.

our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets,

David - 

Please review the insert that Entergy provided.  They have requested that the 
Into Entergy System Border includes... "from an interface that has sufficient 
ATC posted that will allow for the purchase of Daily Network Designated 
Resources on the Entergy Transmission System."

I am ok with this b/c the def of an into product requires firm trans to be 
avail to sink into the CA (Entergy in this case).  In the event firm is not 
avail, then supplier can take LD risk associated with non-firm trans.

Entergy agreed with this interpretation.

Also, because this is a large deal for them, they need to get approval from 
higher levels.

Please provide me with some feedback as this deal is critical to my trading 
position/strategy.

Thanks,
Rogers

Hi

Can you can hit on Wed (lunch or afternoon fine for me)?  Talk to you soon.

Thurs at 530 would work great - See ya there 

PS I didn't make the masters yet but ...... soon? I'm talking to my brother 
who is having some rough times about doing another family triathlon together 
at a Delaware beach.  Of course I'd have to somehow find a bike to practice 
on - I haven't been on one since Sam was born.  See ya Thurs.

Hi Andy

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but 
Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on 
August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol 
could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as 
always thanks for your help.

 HI Pamela

Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it 
turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from 
speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - 
hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.

Perhaps we could clarify the following issues at our next meeting:

* Is there a difference between credit assurances and performance
assurances?
* Is a guarantee considered a credit assurance or a performance
assurance?
* In sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c), I am not sure that a margin call is
clearly defined. I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as
a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this
definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the
amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution.

Your comments would be appreciated.

I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
"workathon" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 

So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday). 

  

how about Mon 1:30

thanks 

By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the 
latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd 
been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential 
use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a "rectangular"
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Tennis plan looks great.  Total time 1 hour 35 minutes.  No problem.  I 
played  last night with Grant and 2 other guys (only the second time I've 
ever played doubles with Grant) - my forehand/backhand down the line won some 
respect (thanks to our practice sessions no doubt) but my net game continues 
to be wobbly, shaky, timid, erratic , random.... in a word, pitiful.  So here 
is to continued improvement - See you at 1130 on Thursday, court 1.

Also Genia sent you by email our EEI cover sheet last week but she just left 
me a message saying you may no have rec'd it.  Did you get it?  If not I'll 
resend.  Just let me know. Thanks

Hi Karen

Going to the legal conference.  Lucky me. I get to go only for Wed. night and 
2 hours on Thurs. then get to fly to DC for meetings w MH and others 
regarding contract standardization.

policy. The new policy is meeting w limited sucess.

Let me know if you need any thing else.

I may have mispoke - I thought you were talking about the power contracts.  I 
don't think the current gas form permits assignements in connection w 
financings, but I could be wrong. let me know what else I can do.

In general, Enron would prefer all matters with respect to power go to 
arbitration for all issues.  When we first started trading power we limited 
arbitration because we were uncertain where/how the market was going.  
Accordingly, we limited arbitration to financial matters only.  I only raised 
the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case 
and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject 
to the arbitration provision or not.  In conclusion, based on today's 
policies (arbitrate everything), I would not think that there would be any 
reason for us to be concerned with preserving  an argument of limited 
applicability of the arbitration language found in the PCA Master.

I briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly.

Thanks
Elizabeth

Elizabeth asked that I request a copy of the above document at your earliest 
convenience.  She will be leaving the office around 11:00 am this morning to 
go out of town and would like to have the agreement to review.  Please let me 
know if I can be of assistance in any way (ext. 3-5438).  Thanks.

Comments on the draft.

The language in 3.1 and 3.4 should be enough to show control of the 
generator's running status by EPMI (which has been delegated to Enron -SE 
Corp. for control area responsibility purposes).

In 3.8, Yes, EPMI would need to schedule the gas and electricity.  Please add 
"EPMI is responsible for scheduling any necessary transportation to the Gas 
Delivery Point and transmission from the Energy Delivery Point."

5.2  Change "energy" to "power"

12.1 As you discussed with Sam, this agreement would have to be filed at FERC.

fyi
thanks
eas
I can also ask Randy Rich at B&P.  He does alot for Becky Cantrell and will 
probably know off the top of his head.  Let me know!
First, on the Control area services agreement, (1) Add "Area" after Control 
in the title  (2) 2nd line-- should be "EPMI to ESE" instead of "EPMI and 
ESE".    Also, Whalley will be "                        "  (I'm checking what 
his title will be and I'll call you so we can finalize and you can initial 
it).

Second,  the LT purchase agreement that was filed at FERC between EPMI and 
SCC was a power purchase agreement.  The new agreement is a tolling agreement 
whereby EPMI delivers gas to Brownsville Power.  Would EPMI transport the gas 
on the pipeline?  or would ECT?  Several months ago, Stacy Dickson called and 
asked me if I knew whether EPMI could buy natural gas or transport natural 
gas  (as opposed to ECT, which does this under the FERC blanket, I think).  I 
told her that I didn't know and she said she didn't think that the particular 
deal she was working on would be structured with EPMI, so not to look into 
this.  Therefore, as I recall, I did not get an answer to this.  I also have 
not looked into the gas side of Genco (see note below).  I thought that Becky 
Cantrell and Julie Gomez handle the gas side for ECT.  If you want me to 
check into this type of question on the gas side, let me know.  I can also 
ask Sam B. who may know right away.  (I have not worked on the gas marketing 
side, just the pipes, so I would need to look this up.)  
Laurel Bolt
05/13/99 12:02 PM
I had a thought this morning.  The three plants are fueled with gas.  GENCO 
buys the gas from ECT, and then transports it to the plant.  Is there any 
FERC reporting requirements related to the gas transactions?

Thanks,
Laurel

Sorry for the late RSVP, but I will be attending the drafting meetings on 
Tues.

Please be advised that the meeting in June for the entire Standard Contract 
Group is now confirmed to take place on Tuesday, June 8th, from 9:30 a.m. * 
3:30 a.m. in EEI's offices at 701 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20004.  A revised contract and agenda will be forthcoming.

If you plan to attend this meeting, please inform Kathy Seaman at 
202/508-5757 or respond to this message by using your e-mail program's 
"ReplyTo" function.  If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach 
Kathy at 202/508-5757 or Andy Katz at 202/508-5616.

In the meantime, attached for the entire group is a Petition for Exemption 
filed with the CFTC on May 19 requesting that certain Electric Energy 
Contracts be exempted from CFTC jurisdiction under the Commodities Exchange 
Act (CEA).  The CEA contains an exemption for Energy Contracts for the 
purchase sale of oil and natural gas products which have certain 
characteristics.  The Petition asks that similarly situated Electric Energy 
Contracts be included in the exemption. For further information on the 
Petition, contact Michael S. Hindus, Cameron McKenna LLP, 415-954-8484,

FYI

As you may know, a group has been convened to develop an industry contract
to trade gas.  The group is called GISB-Canada and as the name suggests,
they intend to use the GISB gas contract as the Base Agreement and to
modify the language to make it applicable in Canada.  At first, they were
just going to change language like "MMBtu" to "joule"; "jurisdiction" to
"province"; and reference a Canadian Bank interest rate rather than the
Wall Street Journal.    They were going to stay away from what they deemed
"substantive" changes.

I have asked them to reconsider this decision and to take the opportunity
to "update" the GISB, hopefully, in a manner that could be used
cross-border.  I have explained that most of our counterparties supplement
the GISB with their own Special Provisions and we could use these
supplements as a starting point for creating an Industry Standard GISB
"update" that could be used cross-border.

In this regard, would you please send me a copy of your company's Special
Provisions so that I can forward them to Ian Anderson in Canada.  Also,
would you please put me in touch with someone in your organization that
might be interested in participating in this effort.  I think it would be
very helpful for the Canadians to hear about our experience with GISB and
gas trading in general in developing an Industry Standard Contract.  The
next meeting in Canada is this Wednesday at 12:00 p.m. (Houston Time) and
again on June 26.  I would like to send them something to consider prior to
the June 26 meeting.

Thank you so much for your help on this.

Dede Russo

Any comments on the attached control area memo re: compliance?

Thanks
Anything fine but if individual orders are being followed, a large salad with 
vinaigrette dressing and some maque chou (sp?).

John
I'm not sure what their issue is but the CFTC issue related to thier interest 
in being able to terminate their purchase obligations for a price.  This is 
the type of provision we can't have in the contract because of CFTC 
concerns.  Let  me know whats next.

John
I'm not in on Friday so is there another day?  Also without wantingto be too 
bold, I will say that we have been down this path before and we just can't 
have a preestablished termination right (unless it is a Default) with 
financial payment.

Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''

To All Subcommittee members:

    TMOS accepted the Enabling Agreement with one exception, they
changed the language in 5.2 and 5.3 to the pre-May 19th language.  It
became clear that even if TMOS sent this issue back to our subcommittee
and the subcommittee voted to keep the revised language, that TMOS might
still not accept it.  The issue, as Kenneth Ragsdale put it, was "who is
going to use the Exhibit "E."  To avoid postponing the Agreement going
to TAC, TMOS decided the issue in their meeting, which they clearly have
the right to do.

    I have  received a few more comments relating to scrivenor's errors
which I would like to clean up.  I will forward a revised final version
to all of you and TMOS by the end of next week.

    To all of you . . . job well done.  To Naim, who continued to
relentlessly push for the completion of this project, THANKS!

Margaret

Please respond to pemlaw@texas.net
To all subcommittee members:

    Attached is the final draft which is being sent to TMOS for
approval.  Because the participants voted 7 to 3 to keep sections 5.2
and 5.3 as they are currently drafted, no changes were made to those
sections.  I reviewed and used most of TXU's and Southern's edits
regarding typos and clarification, which I appreciate.  If you would
like to see the changes, then go to Track Changes and highlight on
screen.

    Thank you all for your help. Hopefully this agreement will be
approved at TMOS and then TAC.  I will (or Naim) will keep you apprised.

Please find attached for your information/review the final form of the 
Canadian Physical Power Master Agreement to be implemented and used by Enron 
Canada to trade physical power in Canada.  This form has been created using 
Regarding the power products tradeable under this master, further to a 
discussion Peter and I had with Jeff Hodge and Christian Yoder, the products 
described in Schedule A have been created based upon an amalgam of the EEI 
products and the WSPP schedules of products.  Given the uncertainty of how 
exactly the two Canadian markets that are set to open in 2001 will look, it 
was determined best to have a minimum of broadly defined products, which will 
be further defined over time as the markets develop, rather than trying to 
introduce a large number of complex products that may end up neither 
applicable nor appropriate and which would only serve to make negotiations of 
the form with counterpartys more difficult.

I would ask each of you to review the form and provide me with any final 
comments you may have at your earliest convenience so that Enron Canada can 
commence marketing the paper to counterparties.  In performing your review, 
please keep in mind that this master is intended to be an agreement that is 
cross-jurisdictional and, therefor, general in scope and nature and will be 
equally applicable to power trades in Alberta as in Ontario (or any other 
province over time).  Any jurisdictional specific provisions will be built 
into the confirms on a trade by trade basis.  Nevertheless, particularly for 
Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson, I do want to ensure that we have not included 
any provisions that may cause Enron Canada any concerns in Ontario or Alberta 
based upon our current understanding of how those two regulatory regimes will 
unfold.

Thanks for your assistance on this matter and I look forward to any comments 
you may have on the document.

Elizabeth and David,

Mike Robison asked that I send you a listing of the counterparties that the 
Y2K team has classified as Mission Critical in order to perform a review of 
the contracts for these counterparties in connection with the Y2K project.  
The attached spreadsheet lists all of the Mission Critical counterparties.  I 
have them sorted by commodity so you can look for power.  Please note that 
there are 2 sheets in the file.  The first contains approximately 140 Mission 
Critical counterparties.  We also added about 60 more that we are assessing 
and these are listed on the sheet labeled "Tier 2".  There is a power list on 
that page as well.  If you have any questions on this information, please 
leave me a message as I will be out of the office starting tomorrow through 
Monday, July 27.  I will be checking messages while I am out on vacation.

In addition, I am attaching the spreadsheet that we used to capture the 
results of our analysis of Houston gas contracts so you can see the format to 
use.

Greg Whalley has informed me that Jim Fallon will now be in charge of East 
Power, West Power, and Emissions Trading.  This means that my boss will now 
be Jim Fallon rather than Greg Whalley.  I met with both Greg and Jim when I 
was in Houston last week.  Greg was very complimentary of the work that we've 
done here.  Greg has become extremely busy since his responsibilities have 
expanded from North American trading to risk management worldwide.  
Accordingly, he thought that it made the most sense to consolidate the power 
trading functions in North America under one person.

Jim was also very complimentary of our work.  We have been profitable for 6 
straight quarters --  exceeded plan in 1998 and have exceeded plan in Q1 and 
Q2 of 1999.  He wants to see this success continue.  Jim expects to spend at 
least one day out of every two weeks up here.  I am looking forward to 
working with Jim.  He has done an outstanding job running the east power 
desk.  This should enable us to increase coordination between the two groups 
and allow us to have a strong advocate in Houston.  While it's too early to 
say anything definitively, I don't expect much to change on a day to day 
basis here.  If anyone has any questions please don't hesitate to ask.

Have a great day

Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.  Our outside counsel 
believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have 
to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP 
because we know TVA will reject it.  Sending this letter is not critical to 
the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.  Before deceiding 
to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this 
information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, 
re acces to transmission through third party transactions.  Lets discuss this 
afternoon.

 - Standardized K 7 21 Clean.doc
 - Standardized K 7 21 Blackline v 2.doc

Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the 
slow and steady march towards a standardized, "national" agreement. Schedule 
C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the 
following is a summary of where the group is headed.

After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of 
firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The 
following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP 
group is currently reviewing:

Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable 
reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or 
recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller 
shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under 
this definition.

Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) 
due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; 
provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for 
LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a 
major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be 
implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the "optics" are 
necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group 
agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one 
Schedule.

Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following 
discussions:

1.  Generated vs. Sold - "Sold" was elected over "generated" because the 
group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the 
generator's reserve requirements.

2. "Schedule"  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.

3.  "Reserves" instead of "Operating Reserves" was used because the group 
thought the word operating may be too restrictive.

4.  "WSCC reserve requirements" was replaced with "applicable" reserve 
requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in 
scope and should not be limited to WSPP.

5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was 
excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would 
accept a non-firm supply as being firm.

6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision 
that has already been made.

This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in 
Denver.  Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is 
shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.  I look forward to 
hearing your thoughts.

Thanks.

Attached is the preliminary outline of a conference EEI is considering 
holding on November 17, 1999 to introduce the form of standardized power

potential speaker.  EEI has also called me to discuss my role in this 
presentation but I wanted to get your thoughts first.  

Thanks

As part of our outreach process for the standardized contract, EEI is 
planning to offer a conference for the industry and regulators on November 
17, 1999 in Washington, D.C.  We would like to invite you to participate in 
the conference as speakers because of your roles in developing the Master 
Agreement.  I've attached a proposed program for the conference would 
appreciate your comments.  Not all the issues need to be part of the oral 
presentation, but could be included in the written handouts.

Please review the program to see which issues you might want to address.  Let 
me know if you are interested in being on the program, are available, or have 
someone else to recommend as a speaker.  As co-chairs of the working group, 
it seems logical to make Patti and Dave moderators. for the main sessions on 
the contract.  I've filled in some other potential speakers.  Also, we were 
thinking of having speakers on managing trading floor operations and credit 
ratings for power marketers.  Any suggestions there would be welcome.  If 
need be, we can set up a conference call to discuss working out the rest of 
the presenters for the program.

Craven Crowell's authority to act without a full TVA board is limited by 
federal statutory authority to only carrying out "administrative functions."  
He is explicitly prohibited from carrying out "policy functions" without the 
other board members in place.  We know who the Administration intends to 
nominate for the two board vacancies, however, these candidates can only be 
officially nominated and confirmed by Congress sometime after Congress 
reconvenes on September 8th at the earliest.

Since I know you would like an immediate fix to your TVA control area issue, 
during the month of August you might pursue TVA's policy actions against our 
control area in violation of federal statute.  (In the meantime, however,  I 
am continuing to work the Appropriations strategy (best possible resolution 
date October 1, 1999) and the Authorization strategy (best possible 
resolution date October 7, 2000.))

Currently, the TVA Inspector General George Prosser who can be reached at  
(423) 632-4120 is in hot pursuit of Mr. Crowell.  He has successfully had 
legislation introduced to curb Mr. Crowell's authorities, and soon will issue 
a report (sure to receive much front page negative publicity) that Mr. 
Crowell "lied" to Congress by failing to disclose a TVA $100,000 monthly 
publicity retainer with Hill & Knowlton to a House Congressional Oversight 
Committee.  Ironically, this retainer was to help Mr. Crowell obtain 
favourable earned media.

We believe  the I.G. could easily be persuaded to pursue the wrong-doing 
caused by Mr. Crowell in developing TVA policy in the absence of a board.  If 
he pursues the case, he would likely immediate reinstate our positions during 
the investigation so as not to cause further harm, plus he could require TVA 
to pay damages if he successfully proves his case.  Regardless, this 
investigation would cause nasty publicity for TVA.

I have discussed with Joe Hartsoe what materials he may wish to provide the 
I.G. in order to help him make our case that this action "created policy."  I 
have also given Joe Hartsoe a listing of all of TVA's industrial customers 
likely curtailed during the heat wave.  We should contact a few of these 
industrials in order to also ask them to intervene against TVA's policy 
action on our control area.  These industrials could also claim monetary 
damages from being wrongfully curtailed by a policy that arguably reduced the 
amount of available power in the region.  

The down side is Mr. Crowell could pursue "administrative" retributions 
against Enron activities.  

is attached.  Please let me know if this does the trick.  I shall work with 
Charles on the more complete description to be sent later in the week.

Elizabeth Sager should consider whether to show this to TVA litigation 
counsel.

Dear Elizabeth,

In response to the recent business reorganization, we are working to=20
streamline Enron=01,s Global Internet addressing structure.  As a result, t=
he=20
messaging group has been working to ensure a timely conversion from our=20
current addressing scheme of "@ect.enron.com" and "@enron.co.uk" to a unifi=
ed=20
"@enron.com" address. =20

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate addresses across Enron's Global Messaging Enterprise. Some of you=
=20
may find that your original  Internet "short name" was changed as a result =
of=20
your short name being the same as someone else's at Enron.   In addition to=
=20
changing to a standard "@enron.com" we have made a global change to allow=
=20
users to receive email  by short name and long name (see below).

This consolidation will become effective for all former ECT users, beginnin=
g=20
Monday, September 6, 1999. =20

 Internet short name:  esager2@enron.com

 Internet long name:  Elizabeth.Sager@enron.com

Please note middle initials may be used to uniquely identify individuals wi=
th=20
the same name and differentiate them as unique, all names do not have middl=
e=20
initials.
i.e. John.A.Doe@enron.com

Your old "@ect.enron.com" and "@enron.co.uk" addresses will continue to be=
=20
supported until November 1st.
When ordering your new business cards, we are recommending that users begin=
=20
printing their long name address instead of short names.
In order to minimize the impact on your business please begin advising your=
=20
outside contacts of your new address and effective date of Monday, Septembe=
r=20
6th as soon as possible.
If you have additional questions regarding your new address, please contact=
=20
your local help desk.

Thank You for your support in this global messaging endeavor.

Do you think anybody in your group would be interested?
Sager
Dear Elizabeth,

Attached is the invitation to speak at "Measuring, managing and
modelling credit risk". If you have any problems opening the file please get 
in touch. I have suggested talk 5 in the pre-conference seminar, however, 
talk 3 is also available. I would be more than happy for you or your 
colleague to speak on either or both of these subjects. I am unfortunately 
working to a very tight schedule so if you could let me know ASAP if you 
could speak I would very much appreciate it.

Many Thanks

To all the patient participants:

    Attached is a copy of the finalized and approved ERCOT Wholesale
Enabling Agreement.  The copyright application is pending but I know of
no reason not to use it before the approximate 6 months it will take to
obtain the copyright.  In any case, as you all know, this agreement was
created by a committee of ERCOT members and their attorneys.  It is a
voluntary instrument and may be used by anyone choosing to do so (even
non ERCOT members).  It is not required to be used by any ERCOT member
or anyone choosing to do business within ERCOT.  It may be modified by
attaching an Exhibit "E."  ERCOT disclaims any liability through use of
the agreement and as reflected in the disclaimer on page one of the
Agreement.

    Please call me with any questions.  Good luck to you all. I enjoyed
working with you on this project.

Thanks

As we initiate the process to certify the Wheatland and Wilton Center plants 
as control areas in ECAR and MAIN, respectively, it is necessary to create a 
special purpose corporation.  As you may recall, we formed Enron-SE Corp. as 
the control area company for the Southeast peakers, and EPMI entered into an 
agreement with Enron-SE Corp. for control area services.

I would like to create a new company named Enron-MW Corp.  Enron-MW Corp. 
would be the entity where the ECAR and MAIN control areas would reside.  
Please proceed immediately to create this new corporation.

Felicia,
In addition to ordering letterhead for Enron-SE Corp., please also order 
corporate letterhead for Enron-MW Corp. 

Never mind.  Thanks though.
To all:  I just talked to Kevin and we will use Enron-SE Corp. for this and 
not set up Enron-MW Corp. (Elizabeth,  we don't see a need to have a separate 
company, since all the confidentiality Ks, etc. are under Enron-SE Corp., but 
let me know if you disagree.  Thanks!)

Your interpretation is correct based on my understanding.  You may want to 
call Dennis to just check in.  Dennis did say that he would include Enron in

I am attaching a revised copy of the agreement. TVA has agreed to these 
changes.
TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where 
we did not think they met our agreements.
My  comments to are as follows:
I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we 
submitted. We support this wording.
In the last paragraph, if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and 
ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence.
Please disregard the original document and let's work from this one.

Hi Christian

Thanks for the email and voicemail - look forward to seeing you in Oct.

This EEI contract is a still a progress in work.  Last week's meeting 
resulted in still more changes. New draft is being prepared and will be 
distributed later this week.  Contract "rollout" is in Nov.

I have scheduled a meeting for October 7th from 8:30 to 2:30 in room 3321 to 
recommence the project we began in January to review the existing 
Houston-based financial, gas and power trading forms.  All of you should have 
received a black binder labelled "Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas 
Forms"  which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as 
such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to 
how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, 
assignement, confidentiality ....).  If you did not receive or cannot locate 
this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.  This 
analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have 
changed since then but have not undertaken to "update" the memo as we will be 
able to discuss such changes at the meeting.

The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based 
trading  forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.  
The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's "model" trading provisions 
should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified 
rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.  With this in 
mind, I would hope to be able to create a "modular type" contract  whereby 
each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language 
that will be approved by the group.  By way of example, Enron's gas contract 
prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any 
reason.  The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably 
withhold its consent.  At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred 
approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, 
which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.  This  "modular 
assignment section" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless 
differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.

You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas 
of a trading contract.  Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with 
other provisions such as credit terms.  At the meeting, I hope to further 
discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.

Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer  from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to 
assist us in this effort.

Thanks

The WSPP operating/contract drafting committee is meeting on October 7 in
Phoenix to discuss the reserve requirements for firm sales.  I would 
appreciate
your review and comments on the following as a definition for Firm Power for 
use
in the WSPP Agreement in lieu of the current language.  This language would be
inserted in Schedule C and replace Sections C-3.3 and C-3.6:

     Firm Power shall be interrupted only if the interruption is: (a) due to 
an
     Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement and 
power
     is not available at the Delivery Point; or, (b) where applicable, to meet
     Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  If
     Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or
     statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages
     for failure to deliver Firm Power as provided in Section 21.3 of this
     Agreement or in any Confirmation Agreement.  If Firm Power is interrupted
     for any reason other than as provided in subpart (a) above, the
     non-performing party shall be obligated to pay damages under this 
Agreement
     or Confirmation Agreement.

Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; 
only my "enemies" get to hear or see me.  And if that doesn't tell you how I

degrees in Houston), I hope for more.  Give me a call and lets try to catch

Hope all is well for you.

Hi Smith

If a six week delay in responding doesn't merit a big I'm sorry I don't know 
what does.  My sincere apologizes in not responding sooner.

We have been looking for a power trading lawyer for about a year.  In March 
Mark H. decided that since we couldn't find one outside that he would bring 
in people internally.  Accordingly, back in April we had 3 internal lawyers 
move into the group.  As a result of this shift,  we are not currently 
looking for additional lawyers for power trading, but if things change I'll 
let you know.  Just FYI, there may be openings in other areas (finance, 
asset  development).  If you are interested, let me know and I'll call you 
back.  Also, I know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand  
...  other organizations may be hiring.  I will be up in Portland, next 
week.  Maybe we can talk then

Again, my apologizes on the long delay.

SCEM - Sonnet Edmund's can be your first stop.  She has a new person who you 
will likely work with but I forget his name.

This is likely the last opportunity we will have for comments, so if anybody 
has any additional comments, please let me know no later than the end of the 
day on Wed, Oct 13th, and I will forward all comments to Caroline on Thursday.

Thanks for everybody's assistance on this effort.

Elizabeth

Attached is the latest EEI contract for your review.  If you have any changes 
you think should be incorporated, please let me know before the the 16th of 
November.

As you all are aware, I have been working with EEI to come up with the 
definition of an "Into" product.  I circulated a draft definition at the last 
EEI meeting.  There will be a conference call on Tuesday Nov.9th from 230 to 
430 to further discuss with EEI members.  Let me know if you would like to 
participate.  In the meanwhile if you have any comments on the draft Into 
definition I circulated, please get me our comments as soon as possible.  I 
will be meeting with the traders later today to discuss with them.  

Thanks for everbody's help on this project.  The end may be near.
The attached Master Purchase and Sale Agreement represents the culmination of 
a tremendous effort by the Standard Contract Working Group and Drafting 
Committee.  Every effort has been made to be as inclusive in the process of 
creating this document as possible.  Many compromises were made in creating 
this contract and  is not necessarily everyone's ideal agreement.  
Nevertheless, the contract should be a workable tool that hopefully will 
benefit the power market.  A clean and redline version of the contract are 
attached.  They were prepared by the Drafting Committee and every effort was 
made to include comments received during and since the September 24 meeting 
at EEI.

At this stage of the initiative, it would not be productive to circulate 
non-substantive comments (word smithing/formatting).  On the other hand, it 
would be useful to send any substantive comments or questions about the 
mechanics of the contract and how the contract language might apply under 
certain scenarios.  The best forum to respond to your questions or comments 
will be the November 17 Power Marketing Transactions conference in 
Washington, D.C.   Accordingly, it would be helpful to tailor your comments 
to the conference program.  Questions, comments, and hypotheticals could be 
worked into the panel discussions.  Moreover, many of your colleagues from 
the Working Group will be on the panels or attending the conference.  For 
your convenience, a copy of the conference program is attached.  Send your 
comments to either Patty Dondanville, pdondanville@schiffhardin.com, or David 
Perlman, dmperlman@pwrsrc.com

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Final version for your files of the ERCOT Trading Agreement.
Hi Everyone:

    It was brought to my attention by more than one eagle-eye that there was
a typo in section 13.1 of the Enabling Agreement.  The PUCT substantive rule
was 25 not 26.  Attached is the corrected document.  The admin office has
this corrected version as well.

    Sorry for any problems.

Despite best eforts, I have not been ableto revie the definition yet and 
likely won't before Tuesday when I'm in DC.  I'll let you know when 
finished.  Thanks

More on the subject, which I haven't reviewed - let me know what you think.

I've rewritten Schedule C as I think we would like to see it.  This draft
defines firm power as we're used to seeing it in the East, and places a
separate requirement on one of the parties to provide minimum operating
reserves.  I wasn't sure who should be the default provider of the reserves;
however, I'm inclined to think it should be the Buyer.  Please take a look
at the attached document and let me know if you have any comments.  I
haven't circulated this to anyone else yet, and probably won't until I hear
back from you.  Thanks to all of you.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Have you seen this?  Obviously, I ended up speaking to that Dow Jones
reporter late last week, at the request of our media relations dept.  I was
horribly misrepresented.  Virtually all of the reporter's questions were
about the factual differences between the EEI and WSPP contracts and this is
what the article ended up looking like.

Hi Melanie

I received your draft answer and am still trying to verify numbers.  When do 
we need to file?  Thanks

TO:  Regional Chairmen

Gentlemen:
     The attachment contains a letter from SERC to the NERC Chairman and the
Chairman of the Policy Interpretation Task Force, with a copy to the NERC
President, on the matter of the TVA/Enron dispute.  I wanted you to be aware 
of
this communication.  I also want to be sure that you understand that our
concerns deal solely with reliability and due process issues.  Please advise 
if
you have questions concerning this matter.

Sincerely,

hi

Thank you

Christi

Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would 
like more information 

(Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect 
confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential 
right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we 
don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)

*EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against 
TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar 
has been assigned the matter.

*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA 
entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).

*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of 
TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to 
schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at 
the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at 
the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes 
that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  

*A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.

*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given 
TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a 
manner similiar to other control areas. 

 One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary 
damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.  In order to make 
such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC 
policies are a "contract" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by 
and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.  One 
concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could 
possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined 
that NERC policies were indeed "contractual obligations" (e.g., a third party 
claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC 
"contractual policies").

It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me 
with any thoughts or comments you have.

Thanks for your help.

CONFIDENTIAL;ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT;NOT DISCOVERABLE

Patty and Harlan

I received your emails.

1. I agree with Patty that I'm not sure the first section of the agenda is 
relevant other than in connection with the product descriptions.

2. I would like to add the Unit Contingent definition as a discussion point.

3. My apologies given, but I'm still working on the revised draft of the INTO 
definition.  I promise that it will be avaiable no later than early Monday.  
If at all possible, I will try to get it out earlier but I can't promise 
given current work committments.  I will let you know by Thursday afternoon 
if it looks like earlier is doable.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Thanks 

Elizabeth

Athough I know that PECO had a variety of questions about the interplay
of the FERC transmission policies and the force majeure definition at
the Nov. 18 meeting, I think we should keep the Houston session focussed
on the Products definitions first, and only deal with the force majeure
definition as it relates to the other products definitions.  If PECO
wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC
policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the
agenda, and certainly not first.
I think it would be very important to attach current products
definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty
to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by
Friday.  Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm
definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged
and to Andy by Friday morning.
  I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the
bookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time.  The other "global"
issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want an
update on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board.  Andy, can
we at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff in
January, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contract
in Houston and New York?  PD

>>> <HEMU@dynegy.com> Tuesday, December 07, 1999 >>>
Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.  One area that I
believe
needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I
think
this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are
concerned
about.

I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the
agenda.
Do we have a definition of the "Into __" product that has been updated
since the
November 9 conference call?  Is there a new defintion of the "Firm
(LD-System
Reliability)" product?

What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?  Is there
any
conceivable way we will have the time?

Thanks,

Harlan

(See attached file: EEI-NEMA AGENDA.DOC)

Into product should be distributed to Andy and Patricia Young.  Emails in 
this email
I've been hiding in the weeds.  Hisss.  I agree w/ Patty and Liz that product 
definition should be the primary focus of the meeting.  It would seem most of 
the transmission related issues PECO (or Dynegy) have could be addressed in 
the context of the force majeure definition and how specific product 
definitions tighten or loosen FM excuses for non-performance.

I think we can represent that discussions w/ FERC staff will take place 
during January.  Our meeting coordinator is talking w/ Mariott about roll out 
meetings in Houston during the first week of March and in NYC late 
April/early May.  Let me know if you have any scheduling conflicts during 
those timeframes and I'll circulate some proposed dates w/ the product 
definitions.  Also, let me know if you are not interested in participating in 
one of or both roll-outs.

I will gladly circulate product definitions, but will be out of town after 
the 10th.  Could you CC: Patricia Young at EEI 202/508-5757 pyoung@eei.org 
with any definitions you want circulated.

Another topic I would suggest discussing briefly  if time is available is the 
results of the contract survey.  We have received many responses. Tabulation 
of the results should be done by our meeting.

Hi John

Thanks for WSJ article.  Now if only you could notify senior management over 
here and let them know I would forever indebted (but hopefully richer as 
well).

TVA has sent us a system impact study agreement that I am having faxed to you 
now.  We have to send out on Thursday.  Do you have time to review and we can 
discuss tomorrow. 

 Thanks

Here are materials I recieved from EEI in anticipation of the EEI product 
description meeting on Wed.   I would guess that the bulk of the meeting  
will be spent on the "Into" definition, which draft was prepared by David and 
myself, but we will also need to provide requested alterations to the other 
product definitions (unit firm and system firm).  If you have any 
questions/thoughts about the Into definiton, please call either David or me.  
Attached is the agenda and draft revised  definitions for the "into" and 
"system reliability" products.  These files are in Rich Text Format.

As part of our discussion of the product definitions, we will discuss the 
effect of transmission curtailments on the parties' obligation to perform.  
We want to focus on the words on the page in Schedule P.   If anyone thinks 
the words on the page do not accurately reflect the business people's 
understanding of the allocations of risk and responsibilities in trading that 
product, please let them come to Houston with alternative WORDS that they 
feel better reflect the business relationships that exist in the 
marketplace.  The goal of the Houston meeting is to have  FINALIZED the 
WORDS, so that the document is ready to present to the industry and FERC.

We will convene at 10 am and adjourn at 4pm.  Lunch will be provided. 
Dynegy's offices are located in Houston at 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800.  If 
you need directions or information about hotels, please contact Michelle 
Cantu,  at Dynegy, 713/ 767-5981.

If you plan to attend, please inform Patricia Young at EEI, 202/508-5757,  or 
respond to this message by using your e-mail program's "ReplyTo" function by

Hi Dede

Dana Davis is the trader that is coming from Enron.

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Richard 
Here is where Genia got on fax room search.  Lets's talk tommorrow about 
where to go from here.
Thanks
	
	

Elizabeth,

We have seemed to hit a brick wall in finding out who has monitored the fax 
machine we have discussed on the 31st Floor.  Don Black's assistant, 
Claudette Harvey said no one really collects the faxes and it is used by two 
groups.  Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be 
monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.  We called the 
service number on the fax to see if we could get a "poll" report listing all 
the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has 
memory for the last 10 faxes.  I have called Lucent (the telephone people) 
and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the 
incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Genia

Andy: We are proposing the following language to start the drafting process
on Option B.  I will be back in the office on 12/28.  Marji

(See attached file: EEIIntoProduct1216992.rtf)
 - EEIIntoProduct1216992.rtf

Attached is a preliminary draft of the letter prepared by Gibbs & Bruns 
notifying TVA of the occurrence of a Triggering Event and EMPI's suspension 
of deliveries under the MOPA.  Please review and call me with any questions 
or comments.  We will need to carefully consider EPMI's offer to provide 
energy under the MOPA at market based rates.  As you are aware,  the current 
plan is to send TVA  notice on Jan. 4th.   

The draft of the control area  petition should be ready for circulation on 
Tuesday, the 28th.   Once received, I will forward both the petition and a 
revised draft of this letter to legal, regulatory and trading for review.

CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVLEDGE

Here is the draft letter for your consideration.  Please distribute this to
the members of the legal team at Enron.  Thank you for your assistance, and
have a happy holiday season.

As we discussed, attached is my draft of a confirmation under the Master 
Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between EPMI and Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services, Inc.  In addition to the comments/questions noted within 
the Confirmation itself, I have the following thoughts/questions:

1) Note that the Enron Corp Guaranty is currently limited to an aggregate 
amount of $30,000,000 (this may become an issue late in the day when the 
folks over at Merrill figure out that this is one of the disadvantages to 
using a confirm as opposed to doing a sep. transaction with a separate and 
distinct Enron Corp. Guaranty);

2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the 
Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs;

3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a "Qualified 
Financial Contract" - is that applicable to this Transaction?  Might this 
somehow cause the accountants to treat the Transaction differently?;

4) Do we need to negate the reference to a "Forward Contract" in Section 4.6 
of the Master (Elizabeth we spoke about a concern that you had regarding this 
exact issue);

5) What changes should be made to the Confirm given the agreed to changes in 
the ISDA (Severability and Notice Update for example);

6) The last sentence of the Master appears to be missing some language.  It 
currently reads "Disallowance of cost pass-through or any unfavorable or any 
Affiliate of the Non-Defaulting Party shall not constitute a requirement for 
a change to the terms of this Agreement.";

7) Should we still eliminate the last portion of Section 8.1(ii) of the 
Master to permit free assignment to an Affiliate (this previously was a big 
issue given our concern that we might have to assign certain rights to an 
Affiliate in the event of a bankruptcy).  Section 8.1(ii) currently reads:

  Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without 
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld 
  in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the 
consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself 
from 
  liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this 
Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts, 
  revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or 
other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this
  Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit 
Support Provider issues a Credit Support 
  Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the 
execution hereof,; 

8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3 
"Facilities".  Does it have to for acct purposes even though the only time 
that it was used was in the sections deal with gas supply (which did not make 
it into the Confirmation) and Section 6.2 of the prior physical agreement 
which used to make "Buyer responsible for charges imposed on the delivery of 
Energy from a given Facility but related to the operation of third party 
transmission" (this provision is not reflected in the Master and I suspect 
that Merrill would object strongly to its incorporation);

9) Did we ever determine whether the draft of the Confidentiality Agreement 
that I prepared was executed by Merrill?; and

10) The Master currently defines Stranded Costs but does not contain the 
standard provision regarding the same (should this be introduced???)

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Per Chris Gaffney's request, attached for your review are blacklines of all 
of the transaction documents.  With respect to these "near final" drafts, 
please note the following:  (i) the Enron Corp.  Guaranty and the form of UIL 
Guaranty are being sent separately as well as part of the WPSA to highlight 
changes made to those documents from the prior drafts (they will appear 
completely underlined as Schedules to the WPSA); (ii) we have incorporated 
much of the comments from Wiggin & Dana with respect to Section 2.2 of the 
PPA Entitlements Transfer Agreement and Schedule 4 to the WPSA, but the new 
text may still need some tinkering with, particularly since the retention of 
the power entitlements by UI (coupled with the payment of the sale proceeds 
to EPMI) required a flow through of some conforming changes throughout the 
PETA; and (iii) the attached side letter relating to the RESCO Power pricing 
has not been reviewed by Enron as of this e-mail.  If you have any questions, 
please do not hesitate to contact Stephen Polakoff at 212-424-8350.

Attached please find the latest credit worksheets for the physical and 
financial transactions between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  
The credit worksheet for the physical transaction is in the form of a 
specific confirmation that will be confirmed under the existing Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services.  
The credit worksheet for the financial transaction is in the form of a new 
ISDA Master Swap Agreement.  Per Bill Bradford, please note that Credit 
approval for both worksheets are contingent upon legal approval by Mark 
Haedicke of the physical and financial setoff/netting assumption.

I have requested and am waiting approval from Jeff McMahon to accept the 
counterparty's request to set the third party cross-default amount of 
$50,000,000.  For the purposes of these credit worksheets, the amount 
proposed remains at $100,000,000 for both parties.

Please call should you have any questions, x3-0554.

Your new offices will be ready in a week or so.  We anticipate your moves 
will take place over the weekend of September 29.  Joy Davis will coordinate 
your moves and can help with obtaining boxes, etc.  

These are the Merrill Lynch Premiums broken out into Financial and Physical

Enclosed are revised documents.  Below is a summary of changes made.  Copies 
enclosed are clean copies.  Please carefully review all documents so that we 
can next move to final execution copies.  Thanks for everybody's help.

Revised Physical Confirm

 Changes Made:

 1)   SET-OFF Paragraph (B) - First sentence deleted and the phrase "of the 
Master Agreement" added
   after the reference to Section 4.2
 2)   Definition of Business Day - changed commas to parenthesis
 3)   Definition of Year added
 4)   Exhibit "D" numbers added and the name of the Exhibit was changed to 
Option Premium
 5)   The phrase "as amended" added in the first paragraph with respect to 
the definition of the 
  Master Agreement
 6)   Definition of Summer Season amended to delete NERC definition because 
NERC is already 
  defined 
 7)   Exhibit "C" - (a) First sentence modified to reflect the fact that the 
Daily Energy Charge calculation
  will vary depending upon whether a given Month is in the Summer Season or 
the Non-Summer 
  Season and (b) the phrase "where," or "and where," was added three times 
immediately prior 
  to each set of definitions.
 
Revised Financial Confirm

 1)   Added the words "shall be" in last paragraph of Section "Energy 
Quantity".
 2)   Deleted proviso in Section "Cash Settlement Amount for each Energy 
Index Point."
 3)   Added phrase in (b) of Section "Billing and Payment" to show that 
payments could go to 
  Seller from Buyer and in (c) to add words "as amended".
 4) Added Exhibit III/Option Premium.

Schedule to ISDA

 Changes Made:

  1. Added ENA as specified entity ML (Part 1 a).
  2. Fixed names in Part 1 (k) from ML and Enron to Credit Support Provider.
  3. Add notice for ML (Part 4/a).
  4. Reference amendment to Guaranty (Part 4 (f)).

              

 <<1rwh01!.WPD>>

 - 1rwh01!.WPD

Enclosed are those documents I believe would be impacted if we elect to use 
separate Credit Support Annexes, one for the new EPMI ISDA and one for the 
Power Master (already in existence ("Old CSA")).  

 1. New Credit Support Annex - to be attached to EPMI/ML ISDA ("New CSA").  
Draft enclosed, including one marked to show changes from CSA currently in 
place between ENA and ML.

 2. Schedule to ISDA - Part 4(F) would reflect New CSA rather than Old CSA.  
Revised Schedule attached.

 3. No Amendment to Power Agreement would be required.  (Delete document 
named "Power Amendment 1).

                                                                     
          (black-line version)

As we discussed, enclosed are execution copies of the documents that we have 
been working on.  Please review, and if acceptable, have an authorized 
officer of ML execute each of the enclosed documents and return to my 
attention at fax no. 713 646 3490.  We will follow up with hard copies.

Thanks for all your help.

Pursuant to my recent conversation with Rodney Malcolm, I am detailing below 
newly negotiated terms that have been accepted by Credit in regards to the 
contracts/confirms for the Merrill Lynch physical and financial transactions:

on behalf of EPMI, Enron Corp. will provide a $60MM guaranty to Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services covering exposures under both Master contracts (either amend 
existing $30MM physical guaranty or supersede existing guaranty with a new 
guaranty)
usage of the the stair-step Threshold that is currently in the Credit Support 
Annex (Paragraphe 13) of the existing Master power contract will remain 
effective for the specific power confirmation.  However, the valuation of the 
parties' exposure will be defined as exposures under the existing physical 
power Master agreement as well as the new financial ISDA Master.  [both the 
physical confirmation and the ISDA Master will need to reference this 
stair-step Threshold provision that will govern margin calls under both 
transactions]
deletion of the investment grade MAC for both credit worksheets (replaced by 
stair-step Threshold discussed above)
third party cross-default amounts:  Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. is $100MM and 
Enron Corp. is $50MM (contingent upon approval by Andy Fastow or Jeff 
McMahon.  I have left a voice message and an email for Jeff McMahon 
requesting approval of the third-party cross-default exception.)

consensus language for products definitions in the Contract.  This would be 
in preparation for a meeting of the entire working group in Houston on either 
Janurary 25 or 26.    We would like to have Reliant, Dynegy, and PECO serve 
on the drafting committee since your companies' have concrete proposals on 
the table.  Several of you have already indicated that you will be available 
for this meeting, will the others please let me know your availability.

Hi

Give me a call about Duke's changes.  I also disagree w (ii) and really think 
even (i) is wrong since an Option can either be in the money or out of the 
money and in either case the full value should be taken and netted against 
other Gains and Losses.

Tomorrow (Wed. 1/5) will be the last day that I am in the office and

On?

Name the time (400?) and the spot (Met?)

e

At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a 
Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering 
Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the 
MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to 
terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this 
point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of 
the MOPA. 

 The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be 
willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned 
on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA 
paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the 
MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.

If you have any questions, please call me at 36349.

Attached is a memo from Julia about a meeting going over some of the deals, 
including power deals, that were closed last year.  Background information on 
the deals could be helpful as several of these deals are likely to be 
administered by power trading.  Let LindaNoske  know if you can make it 
(lunch will be served)

Elizabeth,  you appear to have inadvertently been left off the list.  Ooops!  
Hope that you and your folks can attend the session. You may want to let 
Linda Noske know if you can attend the session so that she has an approximate 
headcount.  Thanks.  Julia
	
	

There IS such a thing as a free lunch (but you have to come to this meeting 
to get it).

On Tuesday, January 11, Chris Gaffney, Stuart Zisman, Dan Lyons and Karen 
Jones will discuss their experiences with some recently completed  
transactions.  These structured commodity deals were unique and interesting 
transactions, and transactions similar to these are expected to represent a 
growing portion of ENA's business.  This will be a good opportunity to find 
out more about this part of ENA's business, and to find out what our 
colleagues have been working on so hard over the past several months.

The transactions that we will discuss on Tuesday are only a few of the many 
deals that have been closed or are in the works, and additional meetings will 
be scheduled to learn more about some of these other transactions.  If there 
is a particular transaction that you would like to know more about, please 
let me know.      

On the agenda for Tuesday:

Chris Gaffney  -- United Illuminating
Stuart Zisman -- Project Doyle
Dan Lyons -- Project Saguaro
Karen Jones -- Project Big Horn (subject to Karen's availability)

The meeting will be held from 11:30 to 1:30 in EB30C1.  

Chris Gaffney

01/04/2000 10:24 AM

Attached are the final documents on the UI deal.  Upon receipt of original 
execution pages we will be preparing closing books containing all of the 
documents. Dan Allegretti is compiling the relevant regulatory materials 
which will be required to administer this deal on an ongoing basis.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

The following is the current schedule for certain actions EPMI has taken or 
is contemplating taking relating to TVA:

Jan 6 -  MOPA- Sent notice to TVA by fax stating that a Triggering Event 
occurred and asking TVA to consider our  proposal in order to continue the 
MOPA in  effect (to date, there has been no response from TVA) 

Jan 24 - Operations - Cut transmission line for 2000 peaker

Jan 26 - MOPA - Notify TVA that EPMI is suspending deliveries under the MOPA  
effective Jan 27 and terminating the  MOPA by selecting an Early Termination  
Date ( which date may be no earlier than 10 Business Days after delivery of 
notice)

Feb 4 - Control Area - File complaint  relating to TVA's actions against 
EPMI's control areas, which lawsuit would be filed in the Eastern District of 
Tenn. (Judge  Edgar) as part of the already filed lawsuit on the interface 
issues

If you have any questions or concerns with this schedule, please notify me 
immediately.  

Unless there are any objections, we will proceed on this basis; provided, 
however, if we hear from Mike Miller that the target operations date of Jan 
24th can not be met, we would then propose to expedite this schedule.  If we 
move up any of these actions, we will notify everybody,

capable of being shortened, so I will look at this with fresh eyes as time 
permits on Monday Jan.17th.  Let me know any thoughts you have.  Before

Jim, Christi-

I thought that at some point this might come up again.  So, I went through 
all of the PUC/PSC websites and pulled Enron's licenses (both EPMI and EES) 
to do business in certain states.  I have attached this to you.

Thanks.

Here are comments on the draft:

12.  "Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:"  The draft says "N/A".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying "no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?" 

Tom, The application says "Q" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as "A", but I am not sure where it should go ("A" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.

Tom has answered some questions:

12.  EES answered "NA"; however, Dan, is this OK?

13.. Ramona Richards checked with someone and told Tom that she should be 
listed for EPMI.

15.  The Rhode Island web site only lists "ECT" as a retail seller, not 
EPMI.  Is this OK?

The A attachment is now inserted with the annual report and Jeff Hodge is 
providing Q.

Attached is a re-write of Product B, based on a general agreement between
Harlan and myself.  I apologize but I had a tremendous amount of problems
with redlining, and so have sent you a document that accepted all changes.
Hopefully someone has a comparerite program.  Andy would you please
circulate this product.  I will be glad to write up a summary in plain
English if you think that would be helpful.   All errors are my
responsibility alone, not Harlan's!  Look forward to seeing you on Wed.

The EES application states that EES will not be serving residential customers 
so it is OK not to have a local office.

I don't know why RI lists ECT, not EPMI.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected  EPMI's offer to continue 
performance under the MOPA at market prices.   Accordingly, we sent a letter 
to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was 
suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) 
EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our 
proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial 
determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.

 Please call me if you have any questions. 

  Copies of the letter will be distributed later today.

Greg, I am not sure where we are on finalizing the Power (Physical) Master, 
but I read it again on the plane and have some minor clean-up matters.  I 
think you should set up a meeting next week b/w Milly, me and you to take 
Milly's comments and discuss and some business points with him.  You should 
also set up a meeting with Hemstock and Dadson to take their comments re: 
market operations.  Lastly you should set up a call with Hodge and Sager to 
get there comments.  I would like to have the Master signed off by end of 
next week.

Greg Johnston

Does ENA have a short form physical power trading document or GTC that it 
uses for short term power transactions for counterparties with whom it does 
not have a master?  As ECC is preparing its physical power trading documents 
right now, we need to also prepare a form of GTC and I thought that, since 
the EEI master was so helpful in my preparation of ECC's form of master, your 
form of GTC would be helpful as well.  If possible, could you e-mail the 
document to me?  I am hoping to put our form together next week.

Cheers

Greg

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 EPMI filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's 
current declaratory judgment action (interface issue) is pending alleging 
that TVA violated NERC rules as a result of TVA's actions during the summer 
of 99.  In order to amend the current petition to include this additional 
claim, EPMI needs the courts approval. 

 Please call me if you have any questions.

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 Pursuant to a letter faxed to TVA today, January 27th, we notified TVA that 
EPMI was terminating the MOPA effective February 11, 2000 (earliest date 
permitted under the MOPA).  At the same time, we filed an amended petition 
with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current claim against TVA (interface 
issue) is pending seeking a declaratory judgment that EPMI had the right to 
terminate the MOPA.  In order to include this additional claim in the already 
filed petition, we will need the approval of the court.

   Copies of the letter will be distributed later .

Hi Andy

I read through all of your Article this weekend . 

 What a job!  

I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic 
copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to 
me by Dede.  After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk over 
the changes so you can see where I was coming from.

Elizabeth, 
Could you please review Alabama Power's attached Terms and Conditions.  All 
bidders must clearly state exceptions to these T&Cs in their offer.  They say 
any exceptions will affect the value of the offer to Southern.

In addition, you should have received last week three summaries regarding 
interconnection structures with Southern at Caledonia.  That interconnection 
review you are doing and this review of the T&Cs are necessary for us to bid 
on the RFP on Feb. 24th.  So if you could get back to me on Feb. 18st, that 
will give me a few days to formulate a proposal.  Also, depending on what you 
think the feasibility of an interconnection is, I may not submit a proposal 
at all since it costs $10,000 to propose.

Thanks for your assistance, please do not hesitate to call me with your 
thoughts - Mike

I'm not sure.  I thought the meeting was being set up to coordinate efforts

Arlynn,

Elizabeth Sager asked me to e-mail the above document to you per your phone 
conversation with her.  Please understand that this is only our standard form 
and would most likely be subject to additional credit terms and conditions.  
The Long Form Confirm houses the commercial terms and the Annex A, the 
General Terms and Conditions.  Please don't hesitate to e-mail me or call me 
at (713) 853-6389 if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Genia FitzGerald

  

As promised, here is rough idea of deal.  Terms have changed since this was 
prepared.   I will keep you informed as the deal progresses.

David,  Sorry I had to jump off our conversation earlier, I had a guy on the 
other line that I having been trying to catch for a while.   I will meet you 
up at Elizabeth's office  at 3:30pm to talk.  Attached is the e-mail proposal 
I recently sent Duke.  Other verbal understandings that have been exchanged 
are:

1.  Duke would be allowed 50 starts per year (June through May each year).  
Each start after 50/yr will have a $1500 per start charge.
2.  Duke gets 1 start per day

Duke has asked for Force Majeure and Availability language, so I guess we 
need to write up a standard PPA contract with all the standard language to 
provide them.  Kevin Presto has provided me the following information on how 
we want to proceed with the Availability issue:

Monthly Availability Calc. = MWHs delivered by Seller(in Month) / MWHs 
Scheduled by Buyer (in Month)

Base Payment = 100% of Demand Payment (Availability = 93% to 95%)

Penalty Payment = 1% bonus for every 1% Availability above 95%
Bonus Payment = 1% penalty for every 1% Availability below 93%

Note: Force Majeure is excluded from Availability Calc. if < 90 days

Thanks for your assistance.  Give me a call if you have any questions, - Mike

Can you gather this information Wednesday morning and let me know when that 
will be available?

Thanks,

Kevin:

I work in Portland in West Power tradng and have day-to-day responsibility 
for managing the Can Fibre account.  Since this deal started in Sept. they 
have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.  They are 
currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on 
another.  They have failed to come up with $ despite two "heart-to-heart" 
discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.  Stone and Webster, the firm 
building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this 
start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.  They seem 
disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.  
If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and 
legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should 
take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.  Instead, Jake 
Thomas indicated that I should talk to you re: next steps. Could you give me 
a call at 503/464-3822 and give me uyour thoughts? 

Thanks!

Tuesday works great for me. 

 As we discussed at the last meeting in Houston, I have begun, but not yet 
finished, revisions to Product B.  I have several questions and will need 
input from others as how best to proceed on some issues.  I spoke w Harlan 
briefly but would appreciate further input, particularly on the "one-time, 
good faith effort" to find an ADI.  I will call Harlan and Marjie to further 
discuss.  A draft will be circulated before the Tuesday call.

Liz,
 I've thought over the things we discussed this morning in my performance 
review and am concerned that my next review may be impacted.  I therefore 
feel it is very important for me to take a proactive role in order to assure 
that I will receive a good review from you and my other assignments at the 
end of the year.  Since I want to perform my job in a way that is totally 
satisfactory to all of my assignments, I would like to suggest you and I meet 
once a week between now and the end of the year to discuss any issues 
regarding my performance and regarding my work product  that has been brought 
to your attention.  I also plan to periodically discuss my performance with 
the other attorneys I am assigned to.  I feel that by staying completely on 
top of the situation, I will greatly improve my working relationship with you 
and my other assignments.  

 If you have any other suggestions that would be of help to me, I certainly 
would appreciate your immediate input.

Kellie,

Attached is the term sheet you delivered to us with our revisions.  Please 
review and incorporate changes and re-submit for final review and pricing.

Enclosed is a revised Term Sheet, one copy of which has been marked to show 
changes from Fred's last draft.  

The Term Sheet is intended to be in no way binding;  references to  the 
proposal being held  "open" have been deleted.  Also, I have not attempted to 
include any reference to SD Warren having the right to receive the financial 
benefits if EPMI resells the Power not used by SD Warren to NEPOOL at a price 
higher than the Contract Price (CFTC concerns).

Dan - Could you please help me fix the definition of "Green Requirement".

Fred - I wanted to stick to "would" instead of "will"  as the operative verb 
in order to emphasize the non-binding nature of the proposal. 

If you have any questions or comments, please call me.  I will not be in the 
office on Friday.  In my absence, please call Leslie Hansen at 36121.

As discussed at the 1/26 Working Group meeting, I am circulating minutes of 
the meeting we had with the FERC staff regarding tariff/filing/reporting  
issues related to the Master Contract.  In sum, the meeting was very 
successful in that the staff does not expect their requirements to impose a 
burden on the utilization of the Standard Contract.  If you have further 
questions, please feel free to contact me.

implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language
also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either
the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price
paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works?

At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's 
response to TVA's recent  letter concerning  EPMI's transmission requests.  
This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from

revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We 
would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this

As we discussed during  the last conference call, attached is a revised 
Article 8,  Credit Provisions, to the EEI Contract, along with a revised 
section for the Cover Page.  The changes were made to make Article 8 more 
user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed  to during 
the conference call.  I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable 
due to the extensive formatting changes.  Maybe you will have better 
success.  I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to 
you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.

The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those 
resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:

1.  Changed  the Section entitled "Performance Assurance" to "Collateral 
Threshold" - Use of PA seemed  misleading since PA is referenced in other 
sections dealing with collateral.

2. Added the words "acceptable to Party ___" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) 
in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)  that the 
security must be acceptable to the receiving party.

3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the 
options are "Applicable" or "Not Applicable".

As always thanks for your help.

Elizabeth -- This letter is excellent.  Attached I added several 
suggestions.  Primarily, I suggest adding to the begining paragraph a few 
words and a sentence to put into perspective what is going on for the quick 
reader.  Also, on the mention of FERC, I suggested a ( ) to place into 
context and lighten the sting.  Lastly, when you use "Commercial" I suggest 
using "commercially reasonable" if that would be the ultimate standard 
applied.  Just suggestions -- use as you like.  Later JOE

Hi Leslie

 I would love to but I'm not sure right now about my schedule. I'm moving 
offices and everything is a mess.   I will call you if it looks like I can

Dear Andy:

     I want to clarify a misunderstanding in your email to the group.  While 
it
is correct that the CFTC proposes to regulate commodities with exhaustible and
nearly inexhaustible supplies differently, it has not characterized power as
having an inexhaustible supply.  In fact, I would expect the CFTC to treat 
power
as having a finite supply at any given time.  This means, for example, that
power derivatives traded on a multilateral transaction execution facility 
would
not qualify for exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act under the current
proposal.  I think the EEI and other industry groups should consider 
attempting
to persuade the CFTC to exempt physical and derivative power contracts from
certain provisions of the CEA under the CFTC's proposal to consider exemptions
on a "case-by-case basis."  See, for example, the discussion of DTFs on pages 
9
and 10 of the proposal.  I hope this clarifies the CFTC's proposal.

     Regards, Paul

36349

A huge debate has been ongoing in he battle whether to include language in 
the EEI Contract that would provide that a confirmation that contains 
"substantive" terms not discussed by the traders is subject to the "deemed 
accepted" language.  I have been very vocal against  adding this language.  
The politics as you can tell from this email have been fierce, and as in much 
of successful politics, dirty.  I'm not sure where this will end up, but feel 
like it is important that we all are aware of the history here as well as 
Enron's position (Confirmation needs to be the final, best evidence unless 
objected to in a timely manner). I will keep everybody posted on the results 
of the vote. 
I am passing on the following message from Patty expressing her concern with 
today's decision to limit the choice on the ballot to optional language or no 
language.  Cutting through the "edge" of her comments, no doubt brought on by 
the frustration of being outvoted, I believe she has some valid points on our 
process here.  I have avoided  taking a position on substantive questions 
regarding the contract, but I too have a process concern  which I have raised 
with some of you individually.  I apologize for not vocalizing these concerns 
this morning.  Nevertheless, this is what I intend to do .  Given that Mitch 
was not available for the discussion and knowing Mitch's position on this 
issue compels me to release the comments he wanted circulated before going on 
vacation.  If there is a consensus from the balloting that the language 
should be included, but not as an option or as an "opt out" provision, this 
drafting committee should respect that sentiment.

The attention of many members of the Drafting Committee has waned and
EEI members (electric utilities which conduct wholesale power
transactions) are no longer represented on the Drafting Committee.
Mitch, in his email, did not think EEI member views were considered on
the Tuesday call.  And today's call  by Constellation, Enron, EPMC (and
Jones, Day and Schiff) did not even include any EEI members...
     The language compromise I accept, and believe that Mitch would
accept, in the spirit of Drafting Committee give and take.  But let's
not kid ourselves.  Today, a few members of the Drafting Committee made
a decision that even Mitch (the only EEI member on the Tuesday call) did
not think we had made or would make.  Read his email.  Today's decision
was to not even "allow" the EEI members' vote to be heard  to choose
what they overwhelmingly chose in Houston --- that is, to have the
provision in Section 2.3 of the Contract --- not just an option on the
Cover sheet). Today's decision is just wrong.
      As the person who was standing in the front of the room in
Houston, I feel strongly  that I know what occurred, and what Comed,
Dynegy,  Cinergy, IPALCO, AEP, Ameren and Toni Frost's group of
utilities, among others, know they voted on.   I am the person that
folks are going to call to ask why their views were ignored.  I had
become comfortable with the explanation for the revote --- to either not
add the language at all, add to 2.3, or add as an option.  But now
Working Group is not being given the choice  to vote as they did, like
the result or not, in Houston.  Even Fritz's suggestion that three
choices be given on the ballot was ignored.  Those three choices, as I
understood it, would have included an even more aggressive elimination
of the 2 business day presumption that the confirm, as sent, controls.

     The question I asked...  why we are afraid of even giving the
Working Group the choice to express the same views they expressed in
Houston...was never answered.
     When  EEI members call me to ask about this, I intend to suggest
that they vote "YES" on the ballot, and then  add an admonition to their
ballot that the language be included in 2.3 and not just be an option on
the cover sheet.  I would hope that the Drafting Committee (or whoever
remains on it) would at least consider such added comments although,
again, after today I have my doubts.  I intend to call some of the EEI
members that I know will feel strongly about this.  Since I know Mitch
will not be around (and don't feel he should be disenfranchised), I also
intend to call AEP as a courtesy.  I no longer support the idea of not
forwarding Mitch's email to the whole group, as he obviously intended.

     Ironically or perhaps intentionally, the Drafting Committee's
failure to address this directly until almost a month after the Houston
meeting means people won't even have a 2 Business Day voting window.
Nonetheless, regardless of the vote, I intend to discuss this in the
implementation discussion in the Houston/New York seminars.

The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
Contract Standization Mailing List.
To Members of the Working Group:

A proposal was considered at the meeting in Houston on January 26 to add 
language to Article 2.3 of the Master Agreement which would require an 
agreement of both parties before any contract terms not part of the oral 
Transaction (but added to the written Confirmation) could become binding.  
Those in favor of adding such language hope to avoid the "long form 
confirmations" which have proliferated in the marketplace in the absence of 
an underlying master agreement - those containing arbitration clauses, Y2K 
representations and other non-commercial terms.  Those who oppose adding such 
language believe it is critical to market participants to know at some point, 
relatively promptly after the oral trade call, that the confirm represents 
the commercial Transaction, and that trade tapes can be overwritten.  They 
ask only that counterparties accept or reject the commercial Transaction 
terms within two Business Days.  If there is a dispute about the terms of the 
Transaction as it appears in the Confirmation, they want to be notified so 
that tapes can be preserved and the issues can be addressed promptly.

After much discussion, the Drafting Committee has developed language that 
could be added.  Given the strong feelings on both sides of this issue, 
however, the Drafting Committee decided to poll each company in the Working 
Group as to whether such  additional language should be added at all.   If 
the Working Group votes "yes", the additional language below would be 
inserted in Article 2.3 as an option that only would apply if selected on the 
cover sheet.

The following wording was developed by the Drafting Committee:

"If a Confirmation contains provisions, other than those provisions relating 
to the commercial terms of the Transaction (e.g., price, special transmission 
conditions), which modify or supplement the general terms and conditions of 
this Master Agreement (e.g., arbitration provisions,  additional 
representations and warranties), then such provisions shall not be deemed to 
be accepted pursuant to this Article 2.3 unless agreed to either orally or in 
writing by the Parties; provided that the foregoing will not affect the 
validity and binding nature of the Transaction."

Accordingly, would ONE representative from each company in the Working Group 
please respond using the REPLY function of your email program to the 
following questions by cob Tuesday, February 29:

 1. Should the language addressing this point be inserted into the Master 
Agreement?  (If  yes, the language will be an option selected on the Cover 
Sheet.)

Yes_____ No_____

Thanks for the vm/fax.  How about trying to talk on Tuesday at 900 houston 
time.  
Elizabeth

I'm attaching my proposed schedule and panel assignments for the March 7 
workshop.  I've already spoken with several of you about your assignments. 
The panel moderators should have a conference call with their panels either 
Thursday or Friday this week to discuss the timing and assignments I put in 
the schedule.  I'd be happy to participate with you.

Materials.  For most of the contract-specific panels, I think we should use 
an updated version of the slides we used in November.  I am attaching the 
original slides and updated versions I've used subsequently.  Please make any 
changes you feel are needed and FAX them to me by noon Eastern tommorow.  I 
am also attaching Fritz' flowchart (into product 2.ppt) of the Into Product A 
and Liz' hypotheticals (examples.ppt).  Liz or Fritz, in light of the latest 
changes to the Into product, do these need to change?

Anyone with separate presentations they want distributed at the workshop has 
two options:  they can email them no later than cob Thursday or, if you can't 
make that deadline, make arrangements to have 110 copies delivered to the 
conference hotel on Monday March 6.  Stapled, 3 hole punched, double sided 
copies would be preferable.

AV -  we will have a laptop, LCD, overhead and slide projector available.

Any speaker who can make it for 7 o'clock dinner at Molina's on Westheimer is 
welcome as EEI's guest.  Houston-based speakers are welcome to invite their 
colleagues to the reception.

Please contact me if you have any questions

Attached is a form of Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement.  I believe 
that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5.  
The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and 
greatest EPMI trading form (although I am reasonably comfortable that the 
cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).  There have been 
numerous discussions about this form being revised.  By carbon copy of this 
email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest 
and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon.

Andy / Fritz:
*Please forward this e-mail to Patty Dondanville as I did not have her e-mail
address*  THANKS!

DeDe and I spoke this afternoon regarding the "Independent Amount" term in the
EEI Agreement.

Just to provide some feedback from a "users" perspective, the "Independent
Amount" concept was something that Elizabeth Sager suggested we use as a proxy
for bilateral margining which I introduced at the Sept. EEI meeting in D.C.
This term was literally "borrowed" from the ISDA Agreement.

The definition used in the ISDA Credit Support Annex is as follows:
"Independent Amount" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified as
such for that party in Paragraph 13; if no amount is specified, zero.
(The ISDA Paragraph 13 is synonymous with the EEI Cover Sheet)

There isn't a "definition" per se.  The term comes into play in 8.3 as it is
added to the Termination Payment and compared to the Collateral Threshold.  To
put it in another way, it acts as "buffer" Termination Payment to handle
additional potential credit exposure created by transactions valued against
extremely volatile price indices.

Please call me in Houston should you have additional questions (713) 207-1211.

Thanks,
Randy

I am circulating the final of version 2-1 of the Master Agreement.  Those 
making presentations at the March 7 workshop should refer to this version in 
their presentations.  After the thorough going over by our reviewers the past 
two days, I can't imagine anything got missed.  Many thanks to the word 
processing dept. at Jones Day in NY and Fritz for getting the document 
formatted.   If something did not get picked up let me know asap.  No 
unilateral changes will be made unless it was an omission or overlooked 
typo.  Remember, I have all your faxes!

I am also attaching a new flowchart of the into product that Fritz prepared.

Remember, today is the last day we can accept presentations for reproduction 
and insertion in the March 7 conference binders.  Materials must be received 
by 4pm Eastern.  Otherwise, please arrange to have 110 copies of any material 
you want to hand out at the conference sent to the  hotel no later than 
Monday, March 6.

I made the following changes to these hypotheticals as I understand the 
changes made to the product:

Example #1

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  Entergy is 
sinking in Cinergy.

Seller must move to another interface (either on  Cinergy's border (NIPSCO, 
LG&E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can 
receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy.  Seller can require 
Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each 
party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to 
reschedule to another delivery point.

Ex #2

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's 
notification and receives response that Firm is available.  Buyer purchases 
Non-Firm instead.  Entergy is sinking in Cinergy.

Ex #3

3. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes 
of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.  
Buyer also secures Firm transmission from LG&E to sink energy in LG&E.

There are references to specific sections in the product definition, I don't 
know if they are still valid in light of the latest changes.

Could someone help me out before 4pm Eastern?  Thanks.

I've spoken to all. Adrianna can't make it either the 15th, 16th or 17th 
(trip to Destin).  Everybody is available during spring break! Hooray! How 
about Monday or Tuesday (that would be best for Rachelle).  Let me know what 
works (I think we should both go, if possible).

So sad.  No questions at all on EEI?  I'm dying having to write a 2 hour 
presentation on this despicable contract and I know not what to do it hurts 
me so bad.  Oh my.  Nice day for a run, even a slow one.

Per Lisa Mellencamp's request, you will find attached a term sheet, 
transaction diagram, and pricing grid spreadsheet (as referenced in the term 
sheet for your reference.  I have also attached a deal schedule that I would 
appreciate your comments on.  I will be out of the office today, but will be 
back in tomorrow.  If you should have any questions, don't hesitate to 
contact me at 3-7350.

Thanks,

Elizabeth, attached are the requests for production which I would like to
serve on Calpine by mail today. Richard suggested that I add a request
asking for all contracts which were not secured by a parent guarantee which
is a good idea. I am in the process of adding that. Please let me know if
you have any other suggestions. By copy of this e-mail I am also asking
David for any suggestions he has.  Thanks. Laura

Good morning, Elizabeth.  I wonder if I could impose upon you to send me a
copy of the most current definitions of the Into products?  I didn't make
the meeting yesterday.  Hope everything went well.  Thank you.

p

 Per my voicemail, attached is a copy of the term sheet as marked up by me, 
not yet shown to Ray Hoppe. 

 Elizabeth & Janet:

Attached is a draft of the memo we spoke about the other day.  We tried to 
come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial 
desire to put in the second interconnect.  As we have discussed, certain 
language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the 
fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at 
the time the project was initially developed.  Nonetheless, we believe that 
Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it 
should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block.  
The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further 
factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places 
in the memo.

Please let me know when you wish to follow up.  And, as I noted in my 
conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in 
Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that 
time.  I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible 
scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA 
"history" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the 
memo.

Thanks  John

Please find attached my markup of the Draft Power Sale Agreement with New 
Hampshire Electric Coop.  I have added some important language in Article 
14.2 to reflect that Installed Capability will still be credited by ISO-NE 
even during an outage at Seabrook (i.e., they should have full liability for 
providing ICAP regardless of whether the plant is operating).  The rest of my 
comments should be pretty clear.

We need to have comments to NHEC by noon eastern time, Monday March 13th.  
Please call me at 978-449-9936 to discuss.  Thanks much.

What's the deal, Michigan vs. Duke? Cox and SagerII? If Arizona does anything 
in the final, SagerI has it nailed.  Arizona any good?
see ya at 415

I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the 
armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport 
only to be intimidated by the words "no less than a 4 hour wait"   (on hard 
floors) .

Any advice?  Your experience certainly must have been better.

Sad I am.

Dear Gail wants a party at a house.  If you remember we volunterred if kids 
came. Gail said kids or no kids, whatever we wanted. what do you think?
Kids (ours plus katie and oscar and eleanor) at our house on Sat.  Punt to 
Ted w/no kids?

Don't go without me ... I can't go this week  ... or next week, other than

the week after that, .... look fine too.

A number of parts of the deal making process are flying around at the same 
time and for the purpose of communicating to the team where legal sees the 
matter at this point I offer the following:

Apparently Greg Whalley has not yet signed the one month DASH.
Credit has requested that legal put a MAC clause in the one month confirm 
before the DASH is resubmitted to Whalley.
West Desk traders (Greg Wolfe and Mike Etringer) report that Kaiser's power 
guys in Spokane are saying that we can "sleeve"  the power to them through 
Bonneville.  To legal, this means we sell power to BPA no strings attached  
and assume nothing about who they resell it too.

Obviously a clean one month sale to BPA is attractive.  But can it be 
detached from the larger call spread transaction?  I don't know.  Given this 
quandry, Greg Wolfe has advised me to hold off temporarily on preparing the 
one off confirmation  until the BPA option is sorted out.  I am following 
this sensible guidance and if anybody has a thought to the contrary please 
give me a call:  503-464-7845.  ----cgy

The Electric Power Board has authorized NES to participate in TVA's
Wholesale to Market Test Program.  Due to the specific requirements of the
TVA program, NES has determined that it is in NES' best interests to enter
into standardized agreements with power suppliers.  To that end, NES has
prepared the attached document as a contract draft for your consideration.
Please contact Eugene Ward, General Counsel, or Laura Smith, Attorney, at
(615) 747-3701 to discuss the agreement.

This is another aggregator that'll be participating in the TVA 5% program.  
They may have as much as 400MW of load.  We need to steer this contract in 
the same direction as the other ones. 

Mike Danielson
Elizabeth Sager

Attached are the documents Mike and I discussed.

1) Fact Sheet provided by TVA
2) Draft Master Purchase Agreement between Valley Energy and your company
3) Sample Confirmation Letter for Transactions under the Agreement

Valley Energy Corporation will be acting as purchase agent for an
aggregated group of TVA power distributors totaling about 400 MW.  We will
be purchasing blocks of 5 x 16 liquidated damages firm energy each week.
The minimum block size will be 25 MW delivered to the TVA control area.

The Draft Master Purchase Agreement reflects the requirements and
constraints placed on us as a participant in the TVA program.

Valley energy is in the process of obtaining a Line of Credit to satisfy
the credit requirements of our supplier counterparties.  We are also
interested in similar protection for situations where liquidated damages
may be due from our suppliers.

Please review the attached documents and provide me with feedback as soon
as possible.

Our objective is to be able to conduct business by April 6, 2000, which is
the first day TVA will allow us to participate.  Power purchased on April 6
would be for delivery beginning April 10, 2000.

Call if you have questions.

Thank you very much,

Elizabeth:

Here is a set of documents which might be useful as a starting point for your 
situation.  The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that 
the California Energy Commission ("CEC") and three California UDC's would 
divert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP 
into the infamous "Lockbox."  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to 
swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and 
dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the 
mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent "Security 
Interest" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds 
and this security interest was for our benefit.  

 Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox 
concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal 
using the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known 
for his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John "Big Sky" 
Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but 
alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.  Good luck and let me 
know if I can help out in any way with your project.----cgy

All:

I wanted to give you a heads-up that we have been shortlisted to negotiate 
with New Hampshire Electric Coop (NHEC) on supplying their load requirements 
from Sep-00 through May-01.   Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly 
quantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on 
updated forwards).  They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug 
at this time.  They seem to have gotten their act a little better together 
this time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would 
still need to be approved by the NHPUC.

Here's the scoop on timeline:

They will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.  We 
need to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.  Elizabeth, does this 
fit your schedule OK?
They plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday 
Apr 10th, and hope to close  a deal that same day.  Again, this deal would be 
subject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC 
disapproval.
Tracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint.   
Is letter of credit sufficient in their case?  Can we talk about what we need 
to put in place for the transaction.

I will be in Houston on Weds-Fri of this week (Elizabeth and Tracy -- I'll be 
sure to swing by and introduce myself).  Thanks much and I'll forward the 
contract when I get it.

As we discussed, attached is a draft of an agreement for Valley Energy.  This 
agreement assumes that Valley Energy would buy power from EPMI and resell it 
to the distributors who have signed an agreement with TVA.  Call me at 713 
853 6349 if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks

I got your email regarding our sale to NHEC.  I will be out of the office 
March 31, and April 3, 6, 7.  When you get the draft contract, please forward 
it ASAP to Brenda Whitehead, my assistant, and Leslie Hansen.  Depending upon 
the timing and the extent of the comments either me, Leslie or another lawyer 
will be able to help you with this.  The timing may be awkward because all 
Enron lawyers will in San Antonio next week, but we will work it out.  Once I 
see the draft, I will have a better feel for the timing.

Talk to you soon

Hi John

Thanks for the email re TVA.  As usual, things got behind me last week so I 
wasn't able to move the TVA letter forward.  I have  promised Kevin something 
by today - so I may be calling you this afternoon.

Hope all is well 

Elizabeth

Hi Dede

Got your message - I would have loved to go; instead I was stuck on a 
roller-coaster of an airplane for over 5 hours fighting a "terrific headwind" 
according to the pilot.

See you at 11:00 unless I hear from you.

Elizabeth

As promised. Call me when you want to disucss. FYI - The letter is very 
"lawyerly"; I'm not sure this is the right approach though.  Let me know if 
you think this tone will do more harm than good.  Paragraphs for you to 
consider are in brackets.

 Richard Tabors number is 617 543 5304.  John Basinger and Barrett Reasoner

Hi

Just FYI - A collection of racquets is more than just a luxury.  On Friday, 
after the matches, I was keen to assert my new found tennis prowess.   I 
thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my 
first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over 
Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out 
came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody 
stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a 
mess.  I think I better work on that shot.

Tennis on Wed.?

There is no guarantor for NHEC.  I have not received the form of LC.  Issuing

Oops forgot to respond to this request. It would be absolutely fine to use 
our arbitration language as an example for the Cover Sheet.  My only 
suggestion would be to leave blank the place for the arbitration (I've gotten 
untold grief for using HOUSTON).

See ya at 1230

Enclosed is are my suggested modifications to the TVA Letter Draft we 
discussed yesterday.   I will prepare the one-line diagram and the project 
description (including the breaker interlock scheme) by the end of the day 
and forward them to you.  Please call me at x57793 if you have questions.

The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

Steve -

My e-mail's been down all day, but attached are my comments on the draft.

Kevin, getting on board this project late, did you anticipate me signing the 
letter, or do you want it drafted for your signature?

Mitch

I will probably sign the Agreement.

We need to send a letter to TVA appointing the Operating Representatives for 
the 4 Interconnection Agreements.   I recommend yourself and Lloyd Will be 
the Enron representatives for the respective Agreements.  I have a previous 
letter in the file (get from Felicia) that you can use a template to create 
the new letter appointing our Operating Reps.  In that letter, we should also 
include the new Enron Contact List (Plants Ops and Control Center Ops).

Enclosed are first drafts of a simplified one-line diagram for the Caledonia 
Project and of a desription of the project.  These would be the documents to 
accompany the letter draft we discussed yesterday.

I would love them if still available

As discussed, attached are the three revised, redlined confirmations dated 
today and showing changes to price terms agreed with NSP today, for 
circulation to NSP . 

Please note that the presence of indexed pricing tied to a monthly average 
may in certain circumstances slow down a party's calculation and invoicing of 
liquidated damages payable under Confirmation 3.   Also note that, if the 
terms of the 3 confirmations are accepted, the "draft" and "not an offer" 
notations will need to be deleted from the top of each page.

Please call me with any questions. --David

Robbi

Sometime on Wed, Thurs. next week would be fine to get together (I'm out 
early next week doing the last of the roadshows on the Edison contract - I 
can't wait for the process to be over - it has been going on for over a year).

Call my assiatant Brenda Whitehead at 35438 to schedule a time.

Pete,

Attached please find my comments and suggested revisions for the Master
Netting Agreement with Enron.  I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same
comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the
provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with
someone from Enron or someone in our shop.

For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes
focused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we
should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for
example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron
Energy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we
may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and
Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an
exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect
at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks.

Ernie

great - I'll see you at the park on Wed

This is HTA...not USTA...so a rating isn't necessary.  So there is nothing to
worry about.  USTA is played in the summer, so you won't have to worry about
having a rating until next year.  Usually, if you play any USTA tournaments,
you will automatically get a rating the following year.  If you're
interested, you should try playing a tournament this year.  Unless you really
try to sand bag your level, they don't care about a rating.

Cindy

I think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before. I don't know the  rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.  I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile.... do you know what the rules require.   I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.   Thanks

Elizabeth,

I have utilized the structuring spreadsheets Tanya used in the original calculations to determine the PG&E receivables.  To the best of my knowledge the following are the settlement numbers for PG&E:

Enron Canada Corp.
April 1-5	C$2,195,876.67
		US$387,627.50
April 6-11	C$2,635,052.00
		US$465,153.00
March receivables unchanged.

Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
April 1-5	US$374,720.00
April 6-10	US$374,720.00
March receivables unchanged.

Please call if you have any questions.
Bill

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Liz,

Here is the administrative claim order.  Paragraph 2 provides that "This Order applies only to administrative expense claims pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 503(a) arising from the sale of electric energy or services for PG&E's customers through the California Independent System Operator (the "ISO") or from the sale of electric energy or services by the California Department of Water Resources (the "DWR") (collectively , "ISO/DWR Administrative Claims").  For purposes of this Order, ISO/DWR Administrative Claims shall not include the following: (i) claims arising from "reliabil,ity must run" ("RMR") charges, (ii) claims by the ISO, and (iii) claims by the DWR based solely on power purchased for direct sale to customers of PG&E, and for which the DWR asserts no independent claim against PG&E or PG&E's bankruptcy estate."

I understand that EPMI sold power to PG&E between April 6, the filing date, and April 9, the date on which EPMI terminated the contract.  Are these considered sales through the ISO?  If they are, we will need to file a separate administrative proof of claim for them by September 20.  If they are not sales through the ISO, the deadline does not apply.

Hi Vicki
Hope you had a good holiday.  When we spoke yesterday, I think I gave you a wrong number for Grant - His work number is 713 522 6300 (ask for Grant Cox).  He is expecting your call around 500 and will meet you in front of the Frost Bank Building on Norfolk (across from the post office).  Ella also has a note for you with this information.

Hi Ellen

Just checking to see when the federal estate tax return may be available for review.  Also checking to make sure you are also working on the Va  estate tax return. Thanks

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Elizabeth-  I sent you a letter today.  To summarize, I asked Lou Alexander to prepare an evaluation of the accounts at Morgan Stanley.  I did not get the information I needed so I sent the securities off to be valued by a company that will turn it around in 5 days.  Once I have the stock info, I can complete the return- without the expenses unless I get them from you before then.  We can deduct on the return any expenses you paid on behalf of your mother from date of death to present including federal and state income taxes.  Send me a complete list as soon as possible.  We can extend the return and pay an estimated amount of tax with the extension.  I would prefer not to extend the return if possible because it is so close to being complete.
The VA attorney told me that the consents need to be notarized.  I have re-sent them to everyone requesting that signatures be notarized.  I don't know why he couldn't let me know that sooner.

Dear Elizabeth;

As per Mark Haedicke's request, please be kind enought to provide me with the short term PPA template that Enron uses in North America and Canada.  Mark asked me to compare the US/Canada and the Brazilian versions for clients who do not have a good credit history and, as consequence, will not enter into a Master Power Trading Agreement type of document.

Thanks and Regards,

Sami Arap

Here are the files I received.  Lisa will be working with Ben to file the proof of claim on Wed. I'm looking at this am. fyi - we are likely going to move the negative ctc claim back to EES and EEMC.  That decision is also being made today.  Thanks for your help - I'll let you know what date to calculate the receivable from after I hear final confirmation from Ben.

I am following up a case that Global Risk Markets was working on about 3 months ago.  I believe it is called Deacero located in Mexico.  It was a power sale agreement and I think Bob Carter was working on the case while he was still with Enron.  We wanted to know what the status of the case was and who is now handling Bob's responsibilities. 

Thanks for your time,

Hi Ellen

I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have not been paid.  Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will provide you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA probate?  When will I receive a draft of the return? I assume we can if necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax? is that right?

Elizabeth Sager

Elizabeth-  I am working on the Federal Estate Tax Return for your mother's Estate and I notice that I don't have any expenses in my file.  Do you have a list of expenses such funeral expenses, etc.?

I expect to have copies of all the Master Agreements by 12:00 today, attached are the confirmations that are sent out in respect of the various delivery points.
	
             
	
I will need to see the ISDA, however, you are more familiar with what the standard language as it relates to the confirmation.
	
The NEPOOL confirmation does not reflect the most recent change that was made to fix the NEPOOL PTF points.
	
The language you sent me from Steve Hall closely resembles the current confirmation language used for the SP-15 and NP-15 delivery points.
	
From a regulatory perspective, as we discussed, we need to be better informed as to the issues and likely framework and structure of the RTOs, which will assist in the drafting of a relatively "certain" delivery point, however until the market is truly established I would expect there to be definitions which rely upon liquidity to feature and the different ways in which liquidity can be calculated, or the fixing of existing delivery points, or simply Seller's choice, possibly with some refinements and limitations as to where the power can be delivered.

As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

   of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss
   the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale

   Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m.

   very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The
   other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES
   and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to

Here is my proposal for a definition of Delivery Point to address the risk that RTO-West will change the existing delivery points to a zonal system:

Delivery Point:  Mid-C or, if the Delivery Point of Mid-C ceases to exist or is modified by RTO-West or similar entity, the zone, physical location, or bus that reasonably resembles Mid-C in terms of liquidity, homogeneity, and physical location. 

Any suggestions?

My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Cly=

ern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were =
starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But=
 in the meanwhile a preview.

The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  takin=
g credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was ve=
ry time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI membe=
rs who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours chall=
enging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will=
 be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After=
 hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose ne=
w language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to me=
et with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, usi=
ng the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evide=
nce of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be=
 able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too p=
ainful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  =
He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell h=
im line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is =
something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others c=

other name for himself.=20

For our call this afternoon.  This is very helpful.  I ta slo sounds compli=
cated, but I think you will se that absent a perfect world, Robert is sugge=
sting only minor changes to the set-off clause previuosly circulated by Mar=
k for EWS trading contracts.  Roberts has also attached more fully develope=
d provisions for both triangular set-off and for square set-off (which woul=
d be applicable under the Master Netting and Collateral Contract) which add=
ress the issues of mutuality, privity and consideration in greater detail.

  Further to our conversations yesterday and today, I attach the following:

1.  Memorandum of Square Set-Off Combinations;
2.  Memorandum of Triangular Set-Off Combinations;
3.  Mandatory Set-Off Language for EWS Trading Contracts -  Revision #1, bl=
acklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke;
4.  Clean copy of attachment 3;
5.  Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions; and
6.  Square Set-Off Provision

This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment.  At your r=
equest I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading =
Contracts as well as the set-off language in the draft Master Netting Set-O=
ff and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of set-off that w=
ill be enforceable in Canada.  (For the moment, I have considered the laws =
applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner, Kevi=
n McElcheran).

Unlike certain jurisdictions (including, for example, Great Britain), in Ca=
nada  a creditor's set-off rights are generally preserved in an insolvency.=
  Section 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 a=
s amended and section 18.1 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, S.C=
. 1985 c. C-36 as amended, both expressly reserve application of the law of=
 set-off in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply.  Contra=
ctual set-off provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provid=
ed the contract of which the set-off provision is part is itself enforceabl=
e (i.e. has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privit=
y and consideration).

Set-off is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with=
 an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar=
-for-dollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent=
 company.  This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who wou=
ld otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the setting-off credit=
or to the insolvent company.

The essence of set-off is mutuality: the setting-off of a claim and cross-c=
laim between the same parties.  The difficulty with the expansive set-off t=
erms sought by Enron is that they would permit "set-off" as between Enron a=
nd its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party.  My concern is th=
at such purported "set-off" is so different in substance from the common no=
tion of set-off which requires mutuality, as to be set-off in name only.  W=
ithout mutuality, I am concerned that a court may not recognize such "set-o=
ff" of obligations relating to third parties as "set-off" within the meanin=
g of Canadian insolvency legislation.  The concern is not only that a court=
 may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolven=
t state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estate's indebtedness to a cred=
itor.  The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purpor=
ts to do that as something other than set-off known under the laws of Canad=
a.  I am not, however, aware of any case law on point.

With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality, I have=
 incorporated language (referred to in the materials as an "aggregate liabi=
lity clause") to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and cross-c=
laim will be between the same parties.

The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in squa=
re and triangular set-off.  These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure=
 that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim =
and cross-claim.

Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts (att=
achment 3), I have the following comments:

1.    I have included wording to clarify that the option to set-off is to b=
e exercised jointly by X and its affiliates.  The reason for this is to avo=
id the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to e=
xercise inconsistent set-off options.  We must assume that this set-off pro=
vision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and va=
rious Enron affiliates.  If the counterparty defaults on more than one of t=
hese contracts, (or if they contain cross-default provisions,) the Enron af=
filiate that is a party to each separate contract would be "X" under that c=
ontract and would have the option to exercise the set-off rights thereunder=
 including the right to set-off against amounts it owes, amounts that are o=
wed to any of its affiliates.  Those affiliates may each in turn be "X" und=
er their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise set-off ri=
ghts.  While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsi=
stently in exercising set-off rights, making it clear that the option to se=
t-off must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates, minimizes any atta=
ck of the set-off provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the=
 potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to set-off.

2.  With respect to the requirement that the set-off contract must have con=
sideration, I have included an acknowledgement by the parties (including af=
filiates) that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants i=
nvolved.  This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of con=
sideration but is helpful.

3.  Paragraph (B) is included to address the mutuality requirement by inclu=
ding an aggregate liability clause, as discussed above.

4.  In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Co=
ntracts, the changes to the sentence including "limitation to" have been ma=
de to clarify that the set-off provision is without limitation to any other=
 rights which X or its affiliates may have.  I was concerned that the "with=
out prejudice" language in the prior draft, would leave it open to the defa=
ulting party to argue that the set-off provision cannot work to its prejudi=
ce.

5.  The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an att=
empt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved.  In attach=
ment 3 I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is =
not as clear and certain as it might be.  I have also attached a revised tr=
iangular set-off provision (attachment 5) which is clearer, more certain an=
d about one page longer.

Finally, I have included a square set-off provision (attachment 6) which af=
fords Enron (and any non-defaulting counterparty) even better set-off prote=
ction.  As discussed, I will include this provision in the Master, Netting =
Setoff and Security Agreement form.

I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience.

Hi Limor

The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of t=
he DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version =
to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written ag=
reement of all parties involved.  We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, sta=
rting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters toget=
her and permit setoff on a square basis.  This undertaking requires a fairl=
y extensive due diligence review. =20

Hope this explanation helps.  Call if you want to discuss further.

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Hi Elizabeth,

One question on the policy.  Why aren't we doing setoffs against amounts du=
e to/from affiliates of the Defaulting Party?

Thanks,

Limor

One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se=
rvices (EWS) manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights.  This is par=
ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com=
modity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of wh=
ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This=
 complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat=
ed entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual s=
etoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master =
contracts.

=09A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that =
will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with w=
hom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set fort=
h below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negoti=
ating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff l=
anguage be added.

MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR=20
EWS TRADING CONTRACTS

=09(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D=
ate, the Non-Defaulting Party ("X") may, at its option and in its discretio=
n, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party ("Y") by X or a=
ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), ins=
trument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affi=
liates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) =
or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp=
ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent =
of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y not=
ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after =
the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not =
affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, "Owed"=
 shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless o=
f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Term=
ination Date.  =09

=09Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be conver=
ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t=
he rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good f=
aith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c=
onverted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate t=
hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the releva=
nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothi=
ng in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other securit=
y interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff pr=
ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, =
netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other righ=
t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operatio=
n of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknow=
ledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of =
the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties =
would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further ackno=
wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip=
al and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affilia=
tes, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and oth=
erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as=
 it relates to Section ___.

=09(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre=
ement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default=
ing Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receiv=
es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may =
include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind w=
hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaultin=
g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag=
reement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early=
 Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

=09This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du=
e and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future p=
ayments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular se=
toff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language ha=
s been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. l=
aws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group =
will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic=
tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, =
prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be require=
d to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other=
 than Events of Default (e.g. "Affected Party" under ISDA).  Finally, when =
incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aw=
are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term=
s (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (app=
licable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should =
remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add=
 setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff la=
nguage into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determ=
ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi=
ll need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist a=
ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of=
 preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua=
lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be=
 able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distribut=
ed shortly.

Hi Mike

There will be a new document for consideration. Do you think it would be a good idea to see if anybody wants to work on it with us together before the next full meeting?  Hope the rest of you weekend went well.  Talk to you soon.

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Should I recirculate the document that you sent to me before or will you have a new document?  I hope to send out documents within a couple of weeks together with an agenda for a meeting.

As was discussed at the meeting, we would like to participate in the process of creating/presenting a long form of Collateral Annex. Thanks

Not to say I told you so about Teesside, but.....

Enron's Skilling Cites Stock-Price Plunge As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Po=
st By John R. Emshwiller  08/16/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Co=
pyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Jeffrey K. Skilling said that=
 the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s plummeting stock price was the mai=
n reason he decided to resign Tuesday as the energy giant's chief executive=
 officer after only about six months in the job.  In an interview yesterday=
, the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on his decision to leave Houston-=
based Enron. On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling insisted he had resigned for "persona=
l reasons" unrelated to Enron's business activities.  In the interview, he =
reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to resign from the company's b=
oard or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed the CEO's duties at the natio=
n's biggest energy trader.  However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his "=
personal reasons" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in =
a crucial business area during his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company=
's stock performance a "kind of ultimate score card," Mr. Skilling noted th=
at Enron's share price had fallen by some 50% this year.  Mr. Skilling said=
 he took that stock-price drop very personally. "I put a lot of pressure on=
 myself" for that decline, he said. "I felt I must not be communicating wel=
l enough" with investors. He felt this particularly given Enron's strong fi=
nancial results over the past several quarters, based largely on growing vo=
lumes in its trading business, which covers a range of items, including ele=
ctricity, pulp and paper.  If the stock price had remained up "I don't thin=
k I would have felt the pressure to leave," he said.  In January, Enron top=
ped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It closed Tue=
sday, before the announcement of Mr. Skilling's resignation, at $42.93 a sh=
are. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron traded at $40.25, after falling below $3=
7 during the day.  Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the d=
epressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron empl=
oyees, many of whom are shareholders. "People would say `What is going on w=
ith the stock, Jeff?' I would have to say I didn't know. It has been frustr=
ating," said Mr. Skilling.  The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in th=
e interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an amb=
itious, bright and thick-skinned business strategist whose long-held goal h=
ad been becoming Enron CEO. Mr. Skilling said that the "final straw" in his=
 decision to leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection w=
ith the deaths of three Enron workers in a power-plant accident there. That=
 trip helped reinforce "how tenuous life is," said Mr. Skilling, who has th=
ree children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged.  While M=
r. Skilling said Enron is in "great shape," his departure raised anxiety in=
 the investment community. Merrill Lynch, for instance, lowered its rating =
on Enron to neutral from buy based on "uncertainty" created by the resignat=
ion.  Yesterday, an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr. Lay plans to name tw=
o executives to the existing "office of the chairman" within the next few d=
ays or weeks. The spokesman said Mr. Lay hadn't yet revealed whom the two w=
ould be. The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilli=

Elizabeth and Mark,  thanks for your help in getting our bandwidth master sorted.  We've used the ISDA materials to relook at the formulation of the termination payment.  Could you possibly find it in your hearts to take a quick look at Section 5.4 regarding the calculation of the termination payment and the definition of Losses?  Again, I have tried to closely track the ISDA model.  Any thoughts would be gratefully received.

Tony, 

Please find attached clean and blacklined versions of the Neosnetworks Master Agreement:

If you have any queries regarding this please do not hesitate to contact me (+44 20 7783 4362).

Hi Travis
 
I already told Mark that I wanted you and Kay to go and he seemed to think that it was a good idea. For safety, would you leave him a reminder vm that you guys are scheduled to go in Sept and that the seminar is in NY with class expenses of 3200.   Thanks
 

Elizabeth Sager

I'm getting ready to make plans to go to this seminar on Sept. 19 -21.  Elizabeth, is there any particular approval process we need to go through -- it's $3,200 a head  

Please note new address and fax number:

Hi Can you get these to Ed Thanks

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Good morning, Elizabeth.

Sheila asked me to update the Electric Power Primer for the new people on the floor.

Rather than circulate outdated materials, I really need to add the current EEI Form in place of the old Master Purchase and Sale 

Agreement.   May I impose on you for an electronic version of your current EEI agreement?    Also, do you have a presentation 

discussing the EEI highlights?   If so, would you have an objection if we coupled it with the EEI agreement and made the pair 

available to new employees? 

I'm not under an immediate deadline, so please reply at your convenience.

Take care,
Ed

sounds great - meet you there

Hi
thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w C=
Y.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the=
 WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought=
, rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  =
How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion,=
 but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Elizabeth:

The EEI cover sheet defines West Firm as follows:  "West Firm" means with r=
espect to a Transaction, a Product that is or will be scheduled as firm ene=
rgy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the WSCC for which the=
 only excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (=
i) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agr=
eement; or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statut=
ory obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in t=
his Agreement, if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its publi=
c utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment=
 of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in Article 4 of =
this Agreement. =20

EnronOnline defines "West Firm" as "power that is or will be scheduled as f=
irm energy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the Western Sys=
tems Coordinating Council for which the only excuses for failure to deliver=
 or receive are if an interruption is (i) (a) due to an Uncontrollable Forc=
e as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreement if the WSPP Agreement gov=
erns this transaction or (b) due to an event of force majeure as such term =
is defined under such other agreement between the Seller and the Buyer that=
 governs this transaction (the "Agreement"); or (ii) where applicable, to m=

 applicable, if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public =
utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment o=
f damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in Section 21.3 of=
 the WSPP Agreement, if applicable, or as provided in the applicable cover =
remedy section(s) of the Agreement.  "WSPP Agreement" means the Western Sys=
tem Power Pool Agreement as amended from time to time.

I wanted to confirm that I should revise the EOL description to delete the =
hilited language.  Please advise.

Leslie

ok w me 

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Harlan and I have discussed the issue.  For all long-form confirms, EOL and over-the-counter, please describe the commodity as follows:  Firm (LD) Energy, consistent with the terms of the "Firm (LD)" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00) including without limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation attached as Annex A.

With the change to the commodity description to make clear that the Schedule P definition of Firm (LD) trumps the GTCs, we do not need to revise the GTCs at this point.  (I am updating the GTCs to conform to the EEI and will let you know as soon as the new version is ready for roll-out in the confirmation process.)

Leslie

Harlan,

Can you advise on the template?  Liz said you would also be working in ERCOT along with David.

Leslie,

Can you advise Sharen on the EOL GTC?

Thanks,
Genia

David Portz indicated that the long form would need to be modified to accept the new ERCOT language.  We have some deals that need to be confirmed on the long form with an ERCOT delivery point.  Can someone take a look at these and tell us what needs to be done, or do we send them out as is for now.

In addition, does the EOL GTC need to be modified to accommodate the new ERCOT language.  We have some deals to be confirmed on the EOL GTC in the ERCOT delivery points.

Thanks!

Tom, 
The person in Houston who will authorize the payment of this invoice is Elizabeth Sager. ----cgy

Christian--For two previous cases (technical sweep & investigation) our CFO has tracked down the right people in Houston to get the invoices paid.  To avoid future delays, pls advise soonest regarding the status of the invoice for the Makad investigation.  Do we need to speak with someone else about this?  Do we need to be sending this invoices to a different office?  Thanks, Tom.

I agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of "the lack of mutuality" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

As you know, we are working on the master netting, set-off and collateral agreement to be used with multiple entities, multiple products and cross-border.  I hope to have our comments on the form by the end of the week.  Hopefully we can then settle on a form and proceed for use with counterparties, such as Engage, etc.

One specific issue, however, is the incorporation of the type of set-off language that has been recently proposed by the Legal Trading Committee and, in particular, the use of "triangular" set-off.  The Legal Trading Committee agreed to restrict the set-off rights of the non-defaulting party to "triangular" set-off for two reasons:

1.	"rectangular" set-off would be stretching the privity/enforceability issue where the non-defaulting party's affiliates were not a party to the master agreement; and

2.	"rectangular" set-off could be stretching commercial acceptability with counterparties.

However, in the structure of a master netting, set-off and collateral agreement, I believe both these issues go away, and I think that "rectangular" set-off is in fact consistent with the arrangement.  Firstly, unlike a master trading agreement, under the master netting agreement both the non-defaulting party and the non-defaulting party's affiliates, as well as the defaulting party and the defaulting party's affiliates, all should be parties to the agreement, therefore addressing the privity issue.  Secondly, in terms of commercial acceptability, by definition I believe that the parties are agreeing to an omnibus relationship for setting off positions and collateral requirements across all product lines with all trading affiliates.

Please let me have your thoughts.

Regards,
Peter

Nothing to date has been communicated to PGE re settlement.  I'll keep you posted (that's a joke).

Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m. (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to proceed.  Thanks.  John

and  get to know some  folks  rather than jumping in head first into a
permanent  spot.If there is anyone  else I should contact who might have
some ideas  I would appreciate hearing  about them as well.If  you have a
chance  , could you send me  Kerry galvin's email address? Iam at  512  653

We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.  Also Do we need to include the 2,400 from Suntrust in my mom's estate since it was held by both my brother (who closed the account this weekend) and my mother?
Thanks

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

Elizabeth-  I got the statements you sent me and it looks like the value of some or all of the stock went down in between December and June.  Were any of the securities in the accounts sold or have you just held onto everything?  If its OK with you, I would like to call Louis Alexander at Morgan Stanley and ask him to prepare a formal appraisal of the securities as of December 31 and June 30.  He might be able to do this without charge since the accounts are at Morgan Stanley.  Let me know.

Hi Roly

Welcome back - I'm running to a meeting and then out this week for work and play, but will try to get hold of you next week. work wise, nothing jumps to mind (Azurix as I'm sure you are aware is the best move you never made),, but I will keep my ears open and my thinking cap on.

Hi, Liz  -

   I am back in Houston after  a  couple of months  in  Europe and Virginia
and  am  starting to look around  for  work post MDCK. If you hear of
anything, I would appreciate  your keeping me in mind. I would most like to
find some sort of  special project  work where I can fill a need  part time
and  get to know some  folks  rather than jumping in head first into a
permanent  spot.If there is anyone  else I should contact who might have
some ideas  I would appreciate hearing  about them as well.If  you have a
chance  , could you send me  Kerry galvin's email address? Iam at  512  653

Elizabeth,
 
Please note paragraph 5.  I have spoken wiht Tracy Ngo.  In addition to language changes, we willwant to confirm that the existing letters of credit that are in place are not torn up.  Also, Tracy had some thoughts about the matrix.

FYI..Jim 

        Attached is an initial draft of a letter agreement between AESC and LVC II, and Enron Power Marketing which is intended to set forth our understanding of the agreement reached between David Parquet and Dan Gordon yesterday.  Although prior versions of this document have been discussed with AESC, in the interest of expediting the review of the draft, it is being distributed to all parties simultaneously, and is for that reason subject to any further comments which AESC may have

concerning it.  

        Since I have not been involved in any of the existing agreements between Enron and Allegheny, I would appreciate it if those of you with knowledge of those matters ensure that I have accurately described in Paragraph 5 of this draft those agreements and the relevant parties to them.

        We look forward to your comments and to moving toward a resolution of the issues between the parties in the near future.

Oscar,
 
This is not a black and white issue.   I have already had several meetings with the desk heads and Elizabeth Sager on this very issue and work has begun.   This is a huge industry issue given the changing RTO landscape and its potential effects on the traditional "into" product.
 
Until there is clarity on the RTO market structure and transmission rights, there is simply not language that we can get comfortable with.  Rather than blame the traders and/or legal for transaction difficulty, why not immerse yourself into the MISO and Alliance documents and find potential opportunities.   Learn the difference between LMP and "into". What are the congestion areas in the Midwest.   What will the basis markets look like?   What is a basis market?What generation units will benefit from LMP/zonal pricing?   What generation will get hurt by congestion? 
 
With regulatory change lies opportunity for marketing transactions.   The fact of the matter is a 2003-06 Into-Cinergy trade (long or short) contains significant regulatory risk, and to protect Enron's shareholders, we need to price addition premium or don't do the trade at all.
 
On the other hand, getting long at a plant bus-bar in a bullish LMP location and getting short LMP seller's choice would be a good trade.   These are the types of transactions the marketing group should be thinking about.   Take advantage of the changing regulatory landscape, don't use it as a crux.
 
I look forward to discussing with you on Monday morning.

I am requesting that the Legal Department draft and approve specific language that the Mid-Marketing groups can utilize in proposals and subsequent contracts to address the issue of RTO development and the impact on the risk profiles of our commercial transactions.

As deal flow and longer term deals continue to increase, the issue of RTO development is having a pronounced impact on quantfying the risk the trading desk is willing to assume along with the pricing to be offered on particular transactions.

While it would be imprudent to avoid long term deals with primary terms that extend over the development timeline of the RTO's, we need to immediately begin to address this issue in our proposals and subsequent deal confirmations.

The Mid-Marketing Team would like to have generic language that we can begin using by 8/10/01. 

Thanks 

Oscar 

Sounds great  - 200 works fro me Alice Wright My assistant will try to assemble the Enron group and will confirm time with you.

Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m. (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to proceed.  Thanks.  John

hi steve
 
could you let christian know about the secretarty situation - I tried to cc him  on the earlier message  sent you but I just got a response saying no delivery.  thanks

Elizabeth, 

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about "ripple" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. 

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's "financial viability" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as "punishing" SPP/NP for "trying to enforce the law," or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  "Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?"  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

Elizabeth,

Greetings.  I hope you enjoyed your vacation.  

In the midst of all of the bad news from California, I thought I would pass on some good news.  You may recall that a while back I encouraged Gov't & Regulatory affairs to withdraw a complaint they had filed with FERC to suspend the ISO's underscheduling penalty.  I asked them to withdraw it because the CAISO Tariff said that the ISO would pay the penalty to Scheduling Coordinators that correctly scheduled load and did not incur the penalty (read Enron).  To make a long story short, Enron withdrew its complaint and FERC ordered that the ISO continue to impose the penalty for the time being.

We just received word today that the ISO is crediting us with approximately $30 million in underscheduling payments.  Although with the defaults we may not get full payment, perhaps we can use this as a bargaining chip/offset with California if we have to make refund payments to the ISO.

Steve  

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve

This is based on the settlement statements that the ISO sent me.

I'll be out alot next week - I have to go back to Co for work and Grant and I are going to stay the weekend but we will be back on the 12th.  Let me know if you find a place ... I'll also be thinking.  Talk to you soon.

GF - Talk to CY or SH about the West Reliant request.  Thanks

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

The two Reliant deals that were sent to Legal (the EOL and non EOL) have already been given to Leslie Hansen for review.

As for the Schedule C being added to the west trades, should Christian or Steve be the attorney to handle those?  Do we have an attorney in the group in Houston familiar with the WSPP?

Genia

David,
I understand you are speaking with Shari Stack of Reliant regarding the wording of the option confirmation letters.  I had two other questions that you might help us with.  Sent to legal (deal 702644.01, 700154.01) EOL and non EOL deal, Enron states: Firm (LD) Energy  Reliant is striking through and placing firm (ld) Energy in lowercase.  
[Portz, David]  I think Genia has already allocated these to another attorney(s) in the group, or if she hasn't already, will.   I think it matters which Reliant affiliate you are speaking of, because we only have the EEI in effect with one of them, and "Firm (LD)" is a defined product type under the EEI. 

Also on our West trades, Product:  West Firm Energy
Reliant is adding service schedule C. [Portz, David]   I am requesting that Genia Fitzgerald designate an attorney who will help you with this. 

I can refax the above confirmations for your review if needed.

NRG Power Marketing:  The past trades that have not been signed by the counterparty, are those considered executed now that we have an EEI agreement?  
Does it cover the additional language in confirmations such as SP 15, NP 15, Nepool language? [Portz, David]    Past trades brought under the EEI Master were referenced on an Attachment A to the EEI Master dated effective June 29th 2001, prepared by Rhonda in coordination with NRG.  As such, the commercial terms of those confirms (corresponding with the numbers on the Attachment A spreadsheet) have clearly been affirmed in writing by the parties; price has not been specifically affirmed in writing however, and the remaining confirmation boilerplate is intended by the parties to be superseded by the EEI Master's terms.  It would thus seem advisable to reconfirm any currently outstanding trades on using the format(s) of EEI confirmation agreed betweent he parties.    The specific language re SP 15, NP 15, & Nepool would remain in effect as to the underlying trades  --  the EEI Master's text does not treat those matters anyway.  

Thanks for your help!

I received a call this morning from Robert Minkoff.  His company is interested in buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I have not had any involvement in the PCA matter for quite some time, so I told him that I would pass along his name and number to someone who might know whether EPMI has any interest in selling its claim.

   Dede Russo and I are planning to have a surprise baby shower for Marty
   Jo
   Rogers from Axia at some point during the two-day EEI Working Group
   session
   next week. We will arrange to have cake, balloons and a few presents.
   All
   you participants are invited to the shower and if I have missed sending
   someone on this email - please forward it on to them.

   Regarding presents, I will buy group presents for the baby this weekend.
   You can either contribute to this or do something on your own (p.s. it
   is a
   boy). If you would like to go in on the group present, you can
   discreetly
   give me money next week but please let me know if so by email NO LATER
   THAN
   THIS FRIDAY so I can plan accordingly. I would imagine that $10 per

Dede Russo and I are planning to have a surprise baby shower for Marty Jo
Rogers from Axia at some point during the two-day EEI Working Group session
next week. We will arrange to have cake, balloons and a few presents.  All
you participants are invited to the shower and if I have missed sending
someone on this email - please forward it on to them.

Regarding presents, I will buy group presents for the baby this weekend.
You can either contribute to this or do something on your own (p.s. it is a
boy). If you would like to go in on the group present, you can discreetly
give me money next week but please let me know if so by email NO LATER THAN
THIS FRIDAY so I can plan accordingly. I would imagine that $10 per person
would be plenty.

Please call me (713) 207-5233 or Dede (713) 207-5240 if you have any
questions.

Thanks!

Shari

Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements, RM01-8-000

ACTION:  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
SUMMARY:  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) recognizes =
that the filing of individual service agreements and paper copies of quarte=

this data must be collected and made publicly available in a manner which i=
s both easily accessible and useful to the public.  To this end, the Commis=
sion proposes that each public utility under the FPA (public utility) would=
 no longer file:  short-term or long-term service agreements for market-bas=
ed sales of electric energy; service agreements for those generally applica=
ble services, such as point-to-point transmission service, for which the pu=

Please see the attached note.  As our mass market retail contracts for Enron Direct Canada are much more unilateral in our favour, as this is more acceptable and consistent in this market segment, the existing set-off language in those forms provides broad rectangular set-off only in our favour.  My inclination is to leave it that way for these forms unless you think otherwise.  Peter.

SENT ON BEHALF OF DEREK FLAMAN:

Further to our meeting on July 17, I have reviewed both the new mandatory setoff language as set forth in Mark Haedicke's memo dated July 12, 2001 (the "New Setoff Language") and the setoff language contained in the Enron Direct retail forms (the "Retail Setoff Language").  The following are the most notable differences between the two:

1.	The New Setoff Language is drafted for "triangular" setoff purposes.  The Retail Setoff Language is drafted for "rectangular" cross-affiliate setoff; as such, Enron Direct may setoff any amounts owed by Enron Direct or any of its affiliates to counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates against any amounts owed to Enron Direct or any of its affiliates by counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates.

2.	The New Setoff Language provides the non-defaulting party with the right of setoff - note that the non-defaulting party could be either an Enron entity or counterparty.  The Retail Setoff Language provides only Enron Direct with the right of setoff - counterparty has no setoff rights.

Given that:  (a)	the aforementioned differences are beneficial to Enron/Enron Direct, and (b) my understanding is that such differences are generally palatable to counterparties in the retail industry, please advise whether the New Setoff Language should be inputted into the Enron Direct retail forms.

Regards,
Derek

Hi Babak

Could you please give me a call - Our credit group has been trying to get in touch with your credit group regarding some margining issues but have been unsuccessful.   I also tried Sonnet but her voicemail is full.  Thanks for you help.

Thanks for this - it is very helpful.  It seeme to have taken everybody by surprise even regulatory.  Have a great weekend and I will talk to you next week.
 
ps on the midmarket change .... I'll circle the wagons as long as necessary.  No way, no how, no reallocation.  In the East, we allocate work based on project not client base.  The West will likely be the same but .. thanks for the heads up so we can react in the most thoughtful of ways.
 
pss on the secretary front, I've been exchanging messages with Karen so I can get the facts and unanimous approval - I'll try to get MH's OK next weekend.  Will call when accomplished.

Elizabeth, 

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about "ripple" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. 

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's "financial viability" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as "punishing" SPP/NP for "trying to enforce the law," or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  "Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?"  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

Elizabeth,

After going over the confirmation process with Kim Theriot and getting a
better understanding of that process, we have reworded
our finding as it relates to the confirmation template.  I think at this
point we agree that allowing read only access to the templates is not
beneficial for both groups.  However, we would recommend that legal at
least periodically review the templates (semi-annually or annually)
to ensure the confirmations are proper.  In addition, as an additional
step, have the deal clearing group attach the approval by legal to those
confirmations that require modifications so that an audit trail exists.
Take a look when you have a chance at the attachment below which has the
revised wording for the finding discussed above and get back to me with any
comments or questions.  Thank you.

Mark

Hello Mark -- I have attached an updated agenda with a minor adjustment:
Emerging Market Forms is changed to Developing Products Market Forms to
better flow with the Committee focus on developing products with an
additional focus on weather derivatives and bandwidth.  This also appears to
be the appropriate place to explore the need to update ISDA's Commodity
Definitions.

Unless you have any objections or additional thoughts I'll go ahead and
issue this agenda with the invitation tomorrow.

Liz-

Hope all is well.  This is a follow up email to the phone message I left you
this morning.

Please see the attached email from Enron's Kimberly Indelicato.  From the
information I have received it appears that this issue has reared its head
because we have asked Enron to sign our EEI confirmation when EKT is the
Seller.  I have looked through our executed EEI and I find no amendment,
addition, deletion, etc.... to Article 2, Transaction Terms and Conditions,
Section 2.3 Confirmation.  EKT believes that it is in compliance with
Section 2.3.  Specifically ..."Seller may confirm a Transaction by
forwarding to Buyer by facsimile within three (3) Business Days after the
Transaction is entered into a confirmation ("Confirmation") substantially in
the form of Exhibit A."

EKT believes it has complied with the requirements of Section 2.3.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

Sounds great - thanks for your help.

Elizabeth,

In his absence, Christian asked me to prepare long-form WSPP confirms to govern existing transactions between EPMI and the above counterparties.  While we are also working on EEI agreements with these counterparties, existing credit exposure is high and Tracy Ngo has requested that we move forward with the WSPP confirms as a stop-gap measure.  I would like to run the confirms by you for approval early next week before sending them to the counterparties.  Let me know if this works for you.

Feel free to contact me by email or phone at (503) 294-9829.

Hi Martin

Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US)  Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck.
Elizabeth

A trading counterparty of the Oslo office has rejected receiving an Enron Corp. Guaranty governed by English law and subjected to English jurisdiction on the basis that  judgments rendered by an English court may not be directly or safely enforceable in the U.S. (nor is New York or Texan law/jurisdiction an option in this case).  Perhaps you or your group could give me a quick guidance on the position of U.S. law as to the enforceability of English and foreign (civil law) judgments.  Additionally, I wonder if you've seen an arbitration clause in any Corp. Guaranty or can advise whether such an approach to dispute resolution would be acceptable to Corp. (since it is to this c/p).  Many thanks.

Martin 

no problem

EAS-

I have a Dr.'s appt. Wednesday afternoon and if it would be OK, I would like to take my discretionary day on Friday.

Hello Everyone,

I am Bowling, yes, you saw right bowling for Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)  Saturday, July 14th.
So I am fishing for donations   << OLE Object: Microsoft Word Picture >> 

Would any of you marvelously wonderful, generous, philanthropic people, like to donate to the cause (and I don't mean the Suzanne Kelly cause)?  All donations will benefit research for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and 40 other neuromuscular diseases.  Any donations would be greatly appreciated.  I can be contacted by e-mail or at 713-345-4192.

Thank you all in advance,

Sincerely,
Suzanne Kelly

Yes - we will likely need to draft new product definitions as well as determine the impact on our long dated Into products.  I have a meeting w Christi Nicolay at 400 to start discussing. I'll keep you updated as I learn more . Thanks.

Elizabeth:  Does the RTO order require a task force to draft new language?  Let me know.  Mark

Has anyone begun to address the issues surrounding the EEI product definitions and the new rules associated with "transporting" power across the new RTO/ISO control areas? Upon discussions with parties involved with the Midwest ISO ("MISO") when scheduling power through the MISO control area a party will no longer designate an interface but only a source and a sink and the Control Area will determine the best path through its system. How will this affect the obligations of the products as defined under EEI. In particular how will this affect the "Into" product definition if the buyer and seller no longer have the ability to select an Interface?

Can you come on October 31 at 9 am to our one hour underwriting meeting in RAC to present the materials you gave at the Legal Conference?

The Wimbledon story is true enough if you think you'll need your overcoat .... on your trip ...... tomorrow.   It really is cold you know.  
My kids, in the meanwhile, think I did play ... they are so tired of me hogging the TV all day (morning to record, evening to watch).  They applaud each point, vainly thinking it is the end.  Which by the way, I hope you got to see.  Monday's match was unbelievable. Any chance LLGM is thinking of opening a London office, replete with ... oh, never mind.  See ya on Wed (just call whenever is convenient)
Elizabeth:  sounds good for Wednesday.  Does something in the 12:30 range sound OK for you?  As of right now, I am planning to fly down Wed. a.m. so that should be pretty safe.  I heard you were tied up all weekend in the Wimbledon doubles matches--is that true?  John

Hi guys - here is a WSPP request for products.  Can you send them the CAISO language.  Should we send other language.  Can one of you attend (I will be on out on vacation starting July 20th) Thanks.  Hope all is well.
The call will involve a discussion of products.  Could you send to me the changes which you have been making to the CalISO product that Enron and others are using?  If there are any other product issues that you want to discuss, please let me know.  I will forward to all on the list what I receive.

Hi Andy

I apologize for the delay in turning the Morgan draft of Collateral Annex - regular business got in the way and we were finishing the final touches on the Collateral Annex that Enron will use pending "adoption" by EEI of its collateral annex (I will forward a copy to you when done).  This process of discussing our internal draft really helped frame some issues in general and will facilitate our putting together a good draft for the EEI group.  I talked to Carol this morning and she is working this week on incorporating all the comments received  into the Morgan draft and we should have something to you no later than the 16th. 

Carol's number is 713 853 3989 if you need to reach her for any reason.

Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in August.
Folks have been asking about the draft Carol is working on.  Could you check on the status and also forward contact info for her?  Thanks.

Hi John

Thanks for the email - I will call you later about this email but in the meanwhile, I'm trying to get new accounts set up with Hunt so that we can separate  mom's IRA into 3 accounts.  Can you email me your SS#.  Thanks

Hi, Liz.   Mom's car is being worked on this week, and I should get it back
tomorrow.  It will probably take me another month or two to get it licensed
in Maryland, because I don't want to take a day off from work to deal with
it.  I wonder if you would please start thinking of some system for
disbursing property from the estate.  Figuring out what to do with the car
has been more than vaguely troubling to me, and I think I figured out the
major reason why.  There are some X number of items of property in the
estate that need to be dealt with.   Each of us will likely want to keep
some and not care about others.  Some of them will likely need to be valued
within the estate, and some of them we can probably disburse informally and
outside of the estate.  How do you want to divide these things up?  The car
just seems to be the first of these things that we need to deal with,
because it costs money to maintain.   Shall we have a lottery for all of
the personal property items?  Shall we sell everything and disburse cash?
Or shall we do something in between?  I would like to deal with the car in
the context of everything else.  I do need a new car at some point soon,
but there is nothing sentimental to me about that car  that would make me
want to keep it (except that it is a convertible, which I could not justify
buying for myself at this point) unless I get it for below market value,
which would not be fair to you or Chi.   The blue book value of the car is
only about $2000, I think, at which price I would probably choose to keep
it until my legal fees are done with and I know where I stand financially.
It is possible we could sell it for $4000 - 5000, but I don't know.   I
know I would not pay $4000 for it.

Looking down the road, I know I think about wanting to improve Andrew's
room, and I think about wanting one of the chest of drawer's that are at
Bob's house.  This is probably sentimental, because I don't think Andrew
will care anytime soon, but, in any case, I don't know what the things are
worth.  I do know that I would like to have a system in place where I don't
need to worry too much about what dollar value we each think something is
worth.

Hi Chris

1.  We don't have a "one off form" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.

2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).

Hope all is good and Addy is doing well. Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.  See ya all soon I hope.

Elizabeth - Two things:

1.  One of our originators has been talking to a Canadian counterparty that wants to do a one-off term (3 year) purchase and sale transaction "into Entergy".  Would they need to put an EEI form in place or is there another document they could use for a one time transaction.  The customer is a pulp, paper and forestry products company.   

2.  We expect to release a form of EEI master in Toronto later this week.  With the warm weather and the 8 month process I have had to not only act as draftsman, but also meeting organizer, communications coordinator, and a number of other roles that have been extremely satisfying.  While I am satisfied that I managed to keep the group from making too many changes to the EEI form I look forward to closure on this project.

Harlan - these are documents that David furnished to Mitch early on, so .... here they are for what its worth.  Thanks
 

  

thanks for your help - we received signed copy today.  talk to you soon.

All:  Attached below is Enron's attorney's revsion of my draft letter

been reviewed by EPMI, however, and there may be additional changes from
them.  Please let me know by cob today if you have concerns or suggested

I have spoken with Bill Bradford. Could we add an agenda item "Rules of Engagement"

Hi Larry

I haven't talked to Bill, but everyone else is OK with letter.  I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.  Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.  If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.  Thanks

Attached is a draft of the Extension Agreement prepared by PG&E and revised by me.  Larry is fine with all changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any comments. Current standstill expired on the 20th and LCs expire on the 29th(Friday).

 Bill - LCs must be soon replaced ; Is someone working on this? Do you want me to look at draw conditions on revised LCs to make sure they track language in Standstill Letter (ie only draw on non-payment in accordance w master)?

Hi Larry

Thanks for the email and the first draft.  I am attaching my proposed changes to the draft - I thought it might speed things up if you and I came up with a form we think works and then circulate it to our respective commercial folks for their approval.  Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.  Thanks again for all  your help.  Talk to you soon.

 

Good morning, Elizabeth.  Thanks for your call.  Attached below is my first
draft of the extension agreement.  I'm flying without instrumentation on
this, though, and your review and comments would be very helpful.  I'm tied
up for a good bit of this morning, but will call when I free up.  Larry

Hi 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that "only I" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.  At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.  In the darkness of early morning, we continued.  A temporary calm exists;  the tropical depression looms.  Call you when the rain ceases.
ps Boston was great, thanks
How was your trip to Boston?  It was a bit "hot" for Boston this weekend
(something like 82 degrees).  Anyway, hope you all had a good time.  I
think I need a martini (I have put 2 kittens to sleep in the past two days
and 2 others have died in my house in the past 3 days, yuck).  Any chance
you can slip out earlish tonight for a drink?  I have my 5 o'clock lawyer
call, but might be inclinded to skip it since I also have a 4 o'clock
lawyer call on bankruptcy issues.

Sheryl

yes positively- this day has been horrible - I'll call you on Wed

can we meet thursday anytime just so we can finish before 2:30 or friday

Question1:=09In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessm=
ent or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following=
?  We understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing E=
All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans=
action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct=
ed over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to all p=
urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t=
elephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In add=
ition, Enron's risk management process is required to be approved by the En=
ron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as=
 a publicly held company.  Enron's risk policies are provided in Enron's pu=
blicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a =
quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk m=
anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron =
trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies=
.  This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C=
hairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of =
transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In a=
ddition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the=
y can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group appro=
ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em=
bedded within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed thro=
ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l=
imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty's bid or o=
ffer via EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there i=
s no human intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit =
checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future=
 price volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f=
low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnl=
ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit =
limits or breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unles=
s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated=
 such that credit limit is still available.

EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters =
into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on E=
nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter=
ms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each=
 commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement i=
s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera=
l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro=
nOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline =
transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the=
 counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count=
erparty chooses to accept or not online, should the counterparty not want t=
o accept to language in the contract (for credit or other reasons), the Hel=
pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou=
p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n=
egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.

Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect=
 data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,=
 does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL col=
lect, use or manage data regarding cookies?

It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's=
 mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no=
 capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is. =20

EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled. =20

Question 3:=09Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades =
showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing=
 such data?  If yes, when?

There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction da=
ta from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin=
e (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides custom=
ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which =
they acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online =
charts for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices=
.  Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa=
d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also all=
ows for administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterp=
arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li=
ne with their own systems.

Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron=
 will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac=
tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For e=
xample, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas =
Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En=
erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commen=
ce on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available t=
o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day'=
s transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo=
rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.

Question 4: =09In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Net=
works flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?

EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen=
ding on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that hand=
les U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi=
an Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office =
utilizing a "bridge":  a process that is capable of communicating transacti=
on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potenti=
al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom=
er with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office system=
s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, =
such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and=
 credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all=
 sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.=
  Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re=
gulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction.

The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through En=
ronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this no=
tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty, =
the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi=
ed by the system at the same time. =20

The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as=
 information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a transa=
ction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that=
 captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.  Enron =
Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does, howeve=
r, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to our s=
ettlement and credit systems.

Question 5:=09Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained =
by EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?

EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The tra=
nsactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases) m=
anaging the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the commo=
dity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos=
t a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is =
policy across all databases.

In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,=
 real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13 comm=
odities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes e-com=
merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t=
ook place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a proprietary, or "=
one-to-many" trading platform. On a "one-to-many" platform, one entity, suc=
h as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a "broker" type platfor=
m). =20

EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t=
he second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both =
the sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer p=
reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month=
s, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices cou=
ld have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the 'bid and off=
er prices" all the time to make more informed decisions.

The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight=
 as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") has enforc=
ement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for pot=
ential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulato=
ry authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale. =
=20

The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over=
 financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant t=
o the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA"), Enron can only trade derivatives with=
 counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Suc=
h transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract =
Participants ("ECPs")(generally, corporations, partnerships and other entit=
ies that meet net worth or asset tests). =20

EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is =
a principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a "trading facilit=
y" as defined under the CFMA.  As a proprietary platform, EnronOnline uses =
Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro=
n and its customers. =20

Attached are draft responses to FERC staff's questions relating to EOL rais=
ed during and after their visit to Enron.   Please provide comments to Lisa=
 Yoho (x53837) or Christi Nicolay (x37007) by COB on Monday, June 25th.  =
=20

Thanks!

Christi and Lisa

    CALIF. DWR AGREES TO FOOT WINDFALL PROFITS TAX FOR SOME
     Some generators that have reached long-term contract deals
with California will not have to pay a windfall profits tax if
it's approved by the legislature, reports Dow Jones Newswires
after an state Senate Energy Committee hearing yesterday.
Instead, the Dept. of Water Resources will foot the bill.
     DWR director Ray Hart told lawmakers: "In some of our
contracts, in order to preserve economics, we had to assure
(generators) that we were not going to tax them." Critics said it
didn't make sense since the state would essentially be taxing
itself. One official with Dynegy Inc. said dealing with the DWR
"was like playing poker with a second grader" since the agency
seemed willing to "give up a lot" (Dow Jones Newswires, Jun. 21).

Hi Elizabeth,

Please find attached a form of a form of retail gas contract and retail electricity contract which we are currently using.  In the retail gas contract, the relevant provisions of the terms and conditions are s.19 Obligations to Third Parties, s.25 Amendments and s.26(c) Termination.

In the retail electricity agreement, the relevant provision is s.25(c).

I hope this helps.

  
If you have any questions or difficulties accessing the documents, please give me a call at (403) 663-2812.

Thanks,

Mark

Firstly, we had some clauses that were in used pre-Alberta dereg. in wholesale confirms that were intended to give us outs in the event that we were found liable for market interference (which ultimately we were not) under "Project Stanley", and also to deal with the fact that there was some threat that market opening may be delayed or that there may be adverse regulatiory interference (such as price caps).  We no longer use these clauses and they were problematic for a number of reasons, including that they were difficult to draft in a way that disguised the issue from our perspective and nonetheless made the transaction "firm" and acceptable to our counterparties.

We also have more general reg. out language in our retail contracts, which by their nature are far more unilateral and less negotiated.

Mark Powell can e-mail you all of these clauses.

Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks

AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.

Register for the seminar through our web site at:

Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks

These contracts are the CDWR deals that got released over the weekend - I'm glad you have them (I was getting copies from Reliant but I'll wait for yours... it will be really interesting to see how the CDWR deals were done).

Elizabeth and Steve, 

Suddenly Jeff Dasovich was on my line telling me he was shipping all of the "released California contracts" up here for quick legal analysis. My first reaction was:  why does Enron have to analyze them?   He is apparently part of a working committee of some sort that is advising the government.  These are the contracts that Davis has held on to so long, but is now releasing, and which will show that he bought high priced power and locked it in for long terms.  Jeff says he is in a room with a bunch of idiots who know nothing about contracts and they are all asking questions about the "out clauses."  He wants us to tell him what the "out clauses" are all about.  Enron never signed a long term deal, so I am wondering what, besides a kind of bizarre curiousity, would have us in that room down there trying to help a bunch of hysterical bureaucrats paw through a foot of legal paper.  

We will get the contracts tomorrow morning and haul them along with us on the plane on the trip down, then talk with Jeff from Houston.  ----cgy

Ed,

I am going to assign the EPMI gty. below to Leslie as she has had a working relationship with Reliant in the past.  Did you also send this on to the other Enron entities that need to review their guarantees?

Genia

We recently recieved notices regarding the cancellation of the Reliant Energy Resources Corp. guarantees.  Attached is the proposed form of replacement.  Please review as soon as possible.  I will be preparing new credit for the EEI and will provide to you next week.

Ed Sacks

Attached below are the new Gty drafts that Reliant is proposing to us.  Please forward the appropriate draft to the responsible attorney for comments and approval to get this process started.   Most of the gty's that we currently have will be terminated this month and need to be reissued with the new Guarantor.

Thanks--Veronica

Veronica,

I'm sending a blank gty to start the negotiations for the following gty:

Here is the form of PG&E letter that we used after consultation with LaBoeuf - it has a few more words.
 

EES wants to terminate energy contracts(futures cintracts) with two bankrupt entities. Can you let Bob Williams know if you have any comments/suggestions to his letter?
Pending Mark Haedicke's okay, here are my suggested termination notices to Unisil and Tri-Valley Growers:

     UNISIL:

                [Date}

                [Jason to provide attorney name]

                         successor by merger to PG&E Energy Services Corp.("EEMC"), originally entered into
                         between EEMC and UniSil Corp. as of December 5, 1997, and subsequently assigned 
                         to UniSil Acquisition Corp. (the "Agreement")

                  Dear ___________:

                  Pursuant to Section 3.3.2 of the Agreeement and Section 556 of the Bankruptcy Code, EEMC hereby terminates 
                  the Agreement, effective immediately.

                  Very truly yours,  

                   Marcus?

TRI VALLEY GROWERS:

                    [Date]

                    [Marcus--who is Tri Valley Growers' bankruptcy counsel?]

                           by merger to PG&E Energy Services Corp. ("EEMC"), entered into as of August 28, 1998 (the "Contract")

                    [Same as UniSil except Contract not Agreement]

did you book?

I understand that the Broadmoor is sold out for the night of the 9th, including the block of rooms held for the WSPP Contracting Meeting.  There is a waiting list, but the waiting list is long.  Here is a list of alternate hotels/resorts in the area, the hotels/resorts have been checked and they do have rooms available:

Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort  (2.5 miles away from Broadmoor)
3225 Broadmoor Valley Road
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-538-4000

Doubletree World Arena       (3 miles from Broadmoor)
1775 E. Cheyenne Mountain Boulevard
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-576-8900

Sheraton Colorado Springs Hotel     (3 miles from Broadmoor)
2886 South Circle Drive
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-576-5900

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but when the arrangements were made for the meeting, there were plenty of rooms available at that time.

Thanks for the reminder - I have calls into Bill/Michael but .... no thoughts yet.  Lisa seems to think PG&E has lost motivation to do anything.

 
High and dry in the HEIGHTS
DOCTOR SAGER - available for notes  at any time in exchange for timely (read PRC) testimonials 

fyi - we have scheduled our wholesale training session for Wed, June 20th at the Doubletree

Elizabeth:

I assume that you may have already handled this, but just in case I thought I would remind you that the expiration date under the existing standstill agreement is June 20th.  My general sense is that I thought we probably would want to extend it, at least once to see if any type of deal is possible.  Is that the current thinking?

I assume that your groundstrokes are pretty powerful now since you have been practicing for a few days with very haeavy and soggy tennis balls.  In all seriousness, I hope that you made it through the weekend ok.

Let me know if you want to follow up.  I am looking for a "doctor's note" to escape from Sithe.

Elizabeth,
Hi!  Next month LSI is holding a conference on restructuring in the Southwest (Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico).  I would like to attend.  Would Enron pay for my tuition and travel expenses?  The cost of the seminar is $397. 
The conference is July 19 and 20 (Thursday and Friday).  Christian will be on vacation that week, but he said that he thought it would be fine if I went as long as I was available by cell phone.

ENERGY RESTRUCTURING IN THE SOUTHWEST

July 19 & 20, 2001
Las Vegas, Nevada
Alexis Park Resort
A B O U T T H E C O N F E R E N C E

"In the wake of California's energy market turbulence during the past summer and the subsequent state of emergency beginning in January 2001, states throughout the Western region are reexamining and, in some cases, reversing their policies regarding restructuring of the electric utility industry. This has resulted in ever changing and frequently confusing laws and policies affecting utilities, energy service providers and customers in Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. This conference will help lay the groundwork for energy professionals from all sectors to better understand current market and regulatory conditions in the Southwest, and the faculty of expert speakers will provide insight as to how evolving policies will shape the markets of the future."

Program Co-Chairs: Arthur O'Donnell and Fred Schmidt, Esq.

Credits: CA: 14 MCLE credits; NV: application pending. Call about other states

Who Should Attend? Lawyers, producers, public and private distributors, customers, brokers, regulatory agencies and anyone else involved in the area's economic development

Thanks for the words - given my week, my month, my year, I need all the reminders I can to refocus and prioritize.  Hope all is well with you.

TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY:
(Written by Andy Rooney ..................................., BUT FROM ME!)

I've learned....That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an
elderly person.

I've learned....That when you're in love, it shows.

I've learned....That just one person saying to me, "You've made my day!"
makes my day.

I've learned....That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the
most peaceful feelings in the world.

I've learned....That being kind is more important than being right.

I've learned....That you should never say no to a gift from a child.

I've learned....That I can always pray for someone when I don't have the
strength to help him in some other way.

I've learned....That no matter how serious your life requires you to be,
everyone needs a friend to act goofy with.

I've learned....That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a
heart to understand.

I've learned....That simple walks with my father around the block on summer
nights when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets
to the end, the faster it goes.

I've learned....That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask
for.

I've learned....That money doesn't buy class.

I've learned....That it's those small daily happenings that make life so
spectacular.

I've learned...That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be
appreciated and loved.

I've learned....That the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me
think I can?

I've learned.... That to ignore the facts does not change the facts.

I've learned....That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only
letting that person continue to hurt you.

I've learned....That love, not time, heals all wounds.

I've learned....That the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to
surround myself with people smarter than I am.

I've learned....That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.

I've learned....That there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies
and feeling their breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....That no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.

I've learned....That life is tough, but I'm tougher.

I've learned....That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the
ones you miss.

I've learned....That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock
elsewhere.

I've learned....That I wish I could have told my Mom that I love her one
more time before she passed away.

I've learned....That one should keep his words both soft and tender because
tomorrow he may have to eat them.

I've learned....That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.

I've learned....That I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do
about it.

I've learned....That when your newly born grandchild holds your little
finger in his little fist, that you're hooked for life.

I've learned....That everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all
the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.

I've learned....That it is best to give advice in only two circumstances;
when it is requested and when it is a life threatening situation.

I've learned....That the less time I have to work with, the more things I
get done.

I've learned....Friends are very rare jewels, indeed.  They make you smile
and encourage you to succeed.  They lend an ear, they share words of praise
and they always want to open their hearts to us.

It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care.  Send
this to everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means sending it back to
the person who sent it to you.  If it comes back to you, then you'll know
you have a circle of friends.

HAPPY FRIENDSHIP WEEK!  YOU ARE MY FRIEND,  I AM YOURS, AND I AM DEEPLY
HONORED!

I got the package - I just found out that Mark is out so I'm trying to get Lance to sign.  Will email you when done. Thanks 

Hi 
Just wondering if you got the package I sent via FedEx last week and had had a chance to get the letters signed.  
I heard that you got more reinforcements recently (Travis and Kaye), and I hope that things continue to go well there.

List:

COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

Oh no.  In the meanwhile,

Ella learned to tie her shoes. Unbelievalbe , but she just did it, just like that.  I talked to her about having Ms Jane help her learn and she put me to shame.

Sam misses you.

I want to book the Broadmoor - it looks great, 3 days tennis, 1/2 day Friday, Sat and Sun, August 10, 11, 12.  Dede is booked, and I have a call in for you and me.  You'll come, right?

I miss you.

I signed up for a little mixed doubles on Friday night, 630 -830.  Do you want me to sign you up?

Everybody is fine.

tomorrow and i can leave.

Out of my hands.

I'll let you know.

In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call.

Don't forget to book the court at the same time as the room! ----cgy

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.
To All:

Bill McCoy has completed an initial draft of a credit annex for consideration by the drafting committee and interested working group participants.  If you provide your comments to me, I'll circulate them.  Bill is willing to have a conference call to discuss when everyone is ready.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Dear Market Participants:

Methodology used in developing the NYISO Virtual Bidding Credit
Requirements:

Day Ahead Market Hourly Zonal LBMP and Real Time Market Integrated Hourly
Zonal LBMP values were used as the data source for developing the NYISO
Virtual Bidding Credit Requirements.  These values are available on the
NYISO web site.  The time period of June 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001
was used.  Peak hours are defined here as the hours of 6am (06:00) through
and including 10pm (22:00).  The absolute value of the difference of the
DAM and R/T price was calculated for each peak hour.  The 97th percentile
of these series of prices was calculated for each zone.  The maximum of
these zonal 97th percentiles was calculated to be $159.33.  The data
manipulation and calculation was performed in MS Excel. The attached
spreadsheet contains the data used in the June 2001 to August 2001
calculations.

By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps.

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a "rectangular"
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Paul Puchot

Ella has an appointment for 1 hour 1130-1230 with Loiuse (recommended by Ms Ing and who is also a good friend of Mary Baisich the women in Clear Lake I was waiting on ) 6 blocks from AOS next Wed.

how about Mon 1:30 

Bonnie and Elizabeth, Calpine agreed to reschedule Elizabeth's deposition to
Tuesday 6/19 at 10:00 a.m. at our office. Elizabeth, are you available on

Leslie -- attached is an agreement Enron needs to execute.  Can you initial for us?  We need to do this ASAP since Keith needs to set up some training sessions with SPP.  It may be that Jim Steffes (VP) for Corp. or Kevin Presto should execute for EPMI.  Thanks.

 

Please see AEP's comments to the EEI Collateral Annex attached.  I have

Perhaps we could clarify the following issues at our next meeting:

*	Is there a difference between credit assurances and performance
assurances?
*	Is a guarantee considered a credit assurance or a performance
assurance?
*	In sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c), I am not sure that a margin call is
clearly defined. I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as
a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this
definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the
amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution.

Your comments would be appreciated.

Hi Joy
 
I RSVP'd yes to this but did not know of the about Indian Princesses schedule- Ella and Grant will be out of town on the 20th so will not be able to make the Scouting for Food event. Sorry.  Thanks and talk to you soon.

Hello Brownie Families,

 

Our 1st grade Brownie troop is starting up!   During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!

 

A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.  

Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a "Scouting for Food" patch.

 

The specifics are:

Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.

Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026

A parent needs to accompany each  child.

Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764

 

There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.

 

Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.

 

If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

 

FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

 

Troop #12478 Leaders - Claire, Sheryl, Barbara and  Joy

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as always thanks for your help.

Hi

THought you might get a kick from this.  Hope you made it home smoothly and spent the weekend playing soccer.  Talk to you soon.

Look at California's spin on contract provisions preventing California from seeking FERC review of contract prices.  California officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power.  Rather than protecting suppliers, these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutiny.---sch

THE STATE
Energy Pacts Bar State From Seeking U.S. Review of Prices
Crisis: The provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations. Consumer advocates want the agreements redone.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

October 15 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Buried in the fine print of the long-term contracts California officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the state's right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high.

Critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated.

"You would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances, because it's patently ridiculous," said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). "It demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts." The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are "just and reasonable." If the FERC finds otherwise, it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits.

In recent weeks, Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities Commission, has asked the FERC to review two of the state's long-term power contracts. The prices and terms of those contracts may be "unjust and unreasonable," Lynch said. Neither contract had the no-challenge clause.

But when asked about contracts that include the prohibition, Lynch expressed outrage.

"They didn't want anybody looking over their shoulder," she said. "From my perspective, that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state. . . . If they thought this was a reasonable contract, why wouldn't they want FERC to uphold their deal?"

State's Bargaining Position Was Weak

The companies with no-challenge clauses in their contracts included Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, Dynegy Power Marketing, Sempra Energy Resources, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., Coral Power and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading.

S. David Freeman, the state's chief negotiator on long-term power contracts who was recently named head of the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis.

At the time the contracts were negotiated, the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases.

"Our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in January," he said. "They were asking, 'Is this a serious deal? Is the state of California committed to it?' What are you going to say--no? [Then] you're not going to get a deal."

The state began a hurried effort to negotiate long-term contracts in January after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights. The costs threatened to bankrupt the state's utilities, which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers.

State officials negotiated dozens of contracts, some lasting as long as 10 years, which offered prices ranging from $58 to $249 per megawatt-hour--a far cry from the $500 per megawatt-hour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time.

But by summer, the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped. California suddenly found itself paying more under the long-term contracts than the $15-to-$30 per megawatt-hour offered on the spot market.

"Look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts. They were pretty much desperate," said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

"We were talking about windfall profits, taxes and seizing power plants, and I think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down, which they have."

Michael J. Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said the clauses provided "the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say we're willing to invest in California."

"It's not that we're superseding anything, frankly, it's that we've said we don't want the party we've done the transaction with to try to derail it," Niggli said.

He acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review.

"The question becomes, 'Will FERC accept that or consider that?' " he said. "And then, 'Do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form?' "

Bowen and Freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny. "Frankly, I wasn't too concerned about the clause," Freeman said. "I don't think it's enforceable."

Enforceable or not, Bowen said, the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek FERC review.

"The very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasn't an evenhanded situation," she said. "I believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances, but that doesn't excuse [officials] from the responsibility of trying to improve the situation now."

Hi Kathy

Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.

Elizabeth Sager

Hi Liz,
 
It was fun catching up with you at  Dr.Injak's.  Like you, I married a geologist (my dad and brother-in-law are  also geologists).  It's a nice change from lawyers.  
I hope Sam is doing OK.  What did the doctor  say to do for him?
Let me know what your schedule is like and we can  meet some time.  I'm fairly flexible, but have a nanny only 2 days per  week, so the rest of the time Connor is with me.  My little  shadow.
 
Ciao,
Kathy Ellis Cook

Elizabeth,
Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back on Monday.

COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

Thanks for the feed back - it may not have been the same Greg Johnston (she said that her Greg had an "e" at the end of his name)

FYI

Alice's first day at Enron will be this Friday, June1st. She will be in employee training on the following Monday.  Alice will also be supporting Harlan Murphy, a new lawyer that will also start on Friday.  Thanks

Greg and Peter

Pamela Hickerson called and wanted to know if I would be interested in speaking in Calgary in Oct. at seminar her organization is hosting. Greg I think you may already be speaking. Is that right?  Would this be a good opportunity?  She wants me to speak about US power trading contracts and on-line trading.   Any thoughts if this is worthwhile?  Thanks for you input.

Hi

Sounds great - what do you think about 7-11 or 12 so the kids can "watch the sun set, too"

Liz-
Willy and I were thinking we would get a sitter from 5pm-11pm on Saturday
night for Sam , Ella and Lucy. What do you think?? The agency charges a
$ 30.00 flat fee and then anywhere from $10- $15 an hour after that.

POWER SALES AND TOLLING ARRANGEMENTS
IN TODAY'S MARKET

On Tuesday, June 5, 2001, Baker Botts will be presenting an internal legal
training seminar entitled "Power Sales and Tolling Arrangements in Today's
Market" in the main conference room on the 13th floor of our Washington
office, 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (The Warner).  Bob Bohme, of our Washington
office, will be the speaker for the program.  He will address a number of
drafting and negotiation problems commonly encountered in power sales and
tolling agreements.  Although the program is geared toward lawyers, it may
also be of interest to non-lawyers involved in these negotiations.

THANKS

As with any pearl, and in your case, enough has been said.  Given everything, else don't fret over this one. I have already enough ammo.

Meeting at Ella's school on Thursday June 7th @1130 w Ms Pickett, Tatum and Ing.

Hi
 
Steve is likely the right person - good luck

713-853-6349 

We are re-evaluating the EBS trading structure.  Currently, EBS uses a series of LLP's to minimize/avoid Texas franchise tax.  I detest LLP structures, as they can be hard to maintain; Lisa feels the same. Our EBS tax contact (Wayne Gardner) advises us that ENA/EPMI handle the franchise tax issue with some form of out-of-state swap, or something along that line.  I'm looking for a contact person who might know something about it.  I'm guessing Stephen Douglas is a good prospect, although I understand he is out.  Any thoughts/suggestions/cautions?
 
Thanks,
 
Kay
 
 

Carol

Can you sit in on this call with me ?   Thanks
Since I will be traveling on Friday - we had to change the conference call on Thursday 2pm EST...If you are able to participate, please call 1-800-.860-2442  In addition, based on responses received regarding availability to date, we are tentatively planning to have the working group meeting in Houston during the week of July 23rd.

Hi Paul

 I have asked JANET MOORE to pick this up from Janice.  JANET's number is 57400.

Janet and Genia

Here is message and info re VEPCO.  Janet can you pick this one up from Janice? Genia can you get file from Janice's office and give to Janet?  Thanks
Elizabeth,

Who will be taking over Janice's negotiations with VEPCO?  Their attorney, Shelley, called and wanted the new Enron attorney to give her a call.  Her number is 804-273-4149.  I apologize that I received this call this morning, but am not getting to you until now.

Paul

Hi John

I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY ), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about invoicing.  

Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs next week.

On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?

Thanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is Lauren ... just call the regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will call you back.

sounds great

Kriste can hit at 12:15.  Can you join us?

Hi

Kriste can hit so we are going to try to meet at 12:15.  Can you join us late? 

Hi

Looking forward to seeing everyone - a babysitter for Lucy, Ella and Sam sounds great.  Let me know if you need me to do anything.

Must be popular -  racquets not due in now to TW until the 25th at the earliest. What's a girl to do.

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

per our discussion 

Attached is a brief memo I prepared in anticipation of the meeting scheduled for Wed., May 23rd, to discuss setoff issues.  Please call if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks

Hi guys

I just remembered that we talked about playing today (1030?) Can anybody make it?  If not, let's try to reschedule.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

can you call brent for me - I'm leaving for dc in a few minutes thanks

Williams Energy has commented on the form of EOL amendment and there are two issues I need to get your opinion on before responding.  Can you let me know when you have a few minutes to discuss it?

Thanks,
Brent

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, howe=
ver, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least m=
ostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 5=
/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which =
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is=
 designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's requi=
rements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories of r=
equirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business participatio=
n in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has adoped a =
"General Commercial Plan" to comply with such requirements, XOM has promise=
d the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  And =
that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to ascer=
tain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in busine=
ss w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a "General Commercial Plan," s=
o we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the last para=
graph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women and min=
ority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under this con=
tract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such things=
 and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's abilit=
y to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and Cathy =
Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy Riley t=
o have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, but h=
e did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to this=
.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 5/1/0=
1 draft) to add a final sentence "The Federal Contract Supplement is attach=
ed as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to the e=
xtent appplicable."  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, bu=
t I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for e=
xample, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), a=
nd Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small busi=
ness requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on this =
or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for bot=
h parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resultin=
g from the "gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its =
managerial and senior supervisory personnel".  You can see the full details=
 of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (sam=
e draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last rou=
nd and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article=
 7 because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver=
 applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptio=
ns to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligen=
ce of its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates b=
ack to the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobi=
l hired a lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged=
 the testing staff to "fudge" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that =
was not in compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dolla=
rs lost were the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages =
were limited to the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab c=
ompany.  So, it's a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's mana=
gers decide to turn off the lights at all the refineries for some specious =
reason, they need to have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued wit=
h them about this, based on the nature of this contract, the power trading =
business, etc. but to no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language i=
n Art. 7, w/ the following rather narrow change, might work for both partie=
s, but it's up to you, now.
=09UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONS=
EQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFIT=
S OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, =
UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that nothing =
in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's liability un=
der Article 10.4(b). =20

Let me know if you have any questions about this. =20

Janice

OK with me - go ahead and prepare final version and then Joe and I will meet with EPMI to traders.  Thanks

Elizabeth,

EESI would like to add the following to your revised Confirmation Agreement (red text only):

Special Conditions, paragraph (2) subparagraph (iii) shall be modified as follows:

"(iii) that any remedy that EESI may have against EPMI under this Transaction is limited by the remedy actually obtained by EPMI under the NYSEG Transaction (unless EPMI shall have failed to pay any uncontested amounts due and owing from EPMI to NYSEG under the NYSEG Transaction or EPMI shall have failed to deliver the Attributes received from NYSEG to EESI, in which case EESI shall have a claim against EPMI for the replacement value of the Attributes not delivered to EESI)"

If the above referenced change is acceptable please forward to me a revised Confirmation Agreement.

Regards,

Richard

 

Here are proposed revisions.  Give me a call after you have reviewed. Thanks

 

Joe & Elizabeth,

I received the revised document from Will Frederking, EESI Legal which is attached for your reference.  The only items that have been changed are in Special Conditions:
Second Sentence was divided into four parts (i), (ii) (iii) & (iv)
Ninth line "or representations" was added after the words "any Affidavits"
Sixteenth line "upon written request from EESI" was added after the words "between NYSEG and EPMI, and"

Joe,  my proposal for Contract Price section is to complete with $3.65 / MWh.

Will provide the payments, billing and notices information as soon as I receive from EESI Legal Department representatives.

Let me know what you think.

I got tickets!

I'll try again - here is TVA confirm with a few minor changes. 

Hi John

Give me a call on this - I was thinking either Marcus Nettelton or Carol St Clair in Houston could help you. Which one will depend in part on how you think the timing will go.

Thanks

Here is the slightly revised TVA Confirmation

Call with any questions.

Thanks

 

Hi Shari

Just a few minor changes  - give me a call and let me know if you think OK.  Talk to you soon.

I have reviewed Chris' version of the Confirmation below.  I have made a
few changes to it now that there is only one Delivery Period.  The attached
is red-lined for ease of reference.

As far as I am concerned, it is ready to go. Let's see if Elizabeth
concurs.

Thanks,

Shari

I thought Derek was great.

I would like to get back to Derek on his trip to Houston last week.  We (Canada) have signed off, including commercial approval from Milnthorp and Cross, subject to satisfactory interviews in Houston.  Note:  Jim Derrick was not available but have scheduled May 25 to send Derek back to Houston to meet with Jim.  Peter.

should I get tickets?

Hi 

Can you make sure we sent a copy of the Newport presentation to him.  Thanks
Dear Ms. Sager,
 
This is one of the attendance of EEI Power Marketing Transactions workshop  on April 18, 19.  
Thank you for your presentation, it was very helpful to me and I  really enjoyed it.
I asked you to send me the documents of your presentation ( your first  presentation on April 18) 
by mail or e-mail, and you said you would do that.
I know you are so busy, but if it's possible, would you kindly  send them by mail or e-mail below?
I look forward to your kind reply.
 
Sincerely,

Can you call Larry and find out if he received and if not, resend, thanks. Phone no. is on lower email.
Elizabeth:  No sign of the document yet.  Are you sending a siignature-ready
copy on Enron letterhead, or should I simply print off a copy, perhaps
re-addressed from Roy to Mike, and send that to you or to someone else at
Enron?  For the life of me, I can't recall what arrangementswe made
yesterday (I'm getting so much older, it seems, and so rapidly!).  Thanks.
Larry

In accordance with my voice message, attached is the Standstill Agreement,
which by copy of this letter I am asking Christian  Yoder, one of Enron's
lawyers in Portland, to have executed by Tim Belden and then faxed to you
at 415 973 5520 (fax) 415 973 3817 (telephone) .  If all is in order,
please have the agreement signed by PG&E and returned to me at fax number
713 646 3490.  If there are any problems, please call me at 713 853 6349.
Thanks for all you assistance in getting this finalized.

(See attached file: standstill3.doc)

I agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think Christian, Steve and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.   

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

The dealers and some of the customers are ok with an EEI but some important counterparties are anti-EEI.  BPA comes to mind.  Digging in our heels on an EEI-only position might make it difficult to get up and running.  Do you have a view of this?

calling!  The dentist rebuilt the tooth on Wednesday, and I am waiting
to see if it will survive.  It looks hopeful, since it hasn't changed
color.  Are you all coming to our party tomorrow?  Susan

intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.  I've been talking to Jim and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.  This issue needs to be addressed soon.
 

Elizabeth Sager 
713-853-6349 

Elizabeth,
 
My understanding is that all inter-company transactions were terminated upon bankruptcy.   Is this correct?

Kevin - 

In the event that the agreement reached on February 09, 2000 between EESI and EPMI (regarding EESI's purchase of a Call Option under the terms stated below) still good,  EESI shall exercise that Call Option.

We are still on for 3 at the Houstonian. I have 2 appointments at 4 for
pedicures.  Will either of you be able to make it with me?  If not, I
need to cancel them.  Anyone interested in a late lunch/last minute
christmas shopping around 1:30?

Travis
 
I read through the document this am and made very few changes.Attached are my minor insignificant comments.  I will be in likely on 28 hopefully by 730.  See you then.

Elizabeth:
 
Here is the draft.  To the extent that it is helpful, EPMI is where PGET was in the last deal; Party A is where EPMI was last time; and Party B is Avista.  It's late, and the document is getting confusing, so I'm sending it to you now without proofing it.  I'm taking it home with me and will read it again tonight.  Have an 8:00 conference call in Mary Cook's office or in the office that I am sitting in right now (Harry Collins' old office).
 
Take care.

I dropped off an original form at Lou's office.  According to Beverly,
who was not in the office yesterday afternoon, returned my call this
morning, could not find the fax I sent yesterday,and said an original is
not necessary, all of the forms will be sent by overnight mail to New
York leaving at four o'clock this afternoon.  I think we have all done
all that we could do and it is in Beverly's hands now.

Would you please remind me about the parties to the master netting agreement that you called me about last week?  I know I already had it on our list to exclude, but I am trying to keep track of which ones I have actually spoke to people about.

Thanks, Trey

look at first document

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

As discussed,  (1) current draft of master setoff agreement:    Recall that distinction needs to be made between parent in defined terms "AEP" and "AEPSC"
throughout the doucment

(2) Mary Cook redline of Master Netting Agreement, circa 11-6-01, showing what was sheared out when CSA is removed:  

(3) Current Mary Cook from Master Netting Agr with CSA:     
For roadmap as to what has changed since AEP draft roughed out from standard format vintage 11-6-01, see Mary Cook e-mail of late this afternoon, which tracks updateing changes.

Will call you in a minute on this

Elizabeth Sager

Just to confirm

	Payment through Wed - 11/14 (with interest) = $14,153,688.78
	Payment through Thur - 11/15 (with interest) = $14,155,586.71

The Settlement Agreement is written based on a Wed payment - if they want to argue for another $1,100 in interest, then we can send it to them in pennies.

Hi Dave  
Here is a revised draft for discussion purposes only of the MNA, marked to show changes from the prior draft of 11/8.  In order to get this to you for your review as soon as possible, I am by copy of this email sending drafts to others in Enron's legal, credit and commercial groups for their first review;  accordingly, there likely will be additional changes based upon their review.  Please call if you have any questions or comments. Thanks

We need to repsond to this.  Tanya- can you confirm the lend and park exposure.	

Steph - please print and add to the list.

Bill,

As mentioned during our conference call this morning, we have significant
Lend and Park activity with ENA (and some activity with Enron Energy
Services).  Potential stressed net exposure peaks at $ 12.4 million in April
' 02.

Due to the recent downgrades of Enron Corp.'s (Guarantor of ENA's
obligations to PG&E) senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by S&P and other
I would appreciate your letting me know when the L/C will be issued.  Thanks

The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.  
I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.

Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.

Kevin and Elizabeth,

Attached is a proposal summarizing our restructuring talks with VEPCO last week.  We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They'd requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.

Discussion summary:
Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).
Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.
VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).
Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index
Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany
Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary
Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01

Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to "fill in the boxes". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.
	
AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.
	
Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues. 
	
It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.
	
The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.
	
Signed you up for this call in your absence.

thanks susan for the update.  when you talk to cathy see if we can get a draft anytime today/tonight - the only chance I will likely have to review it will be Wed morning, very early (around 4 or 5 am).

Susan,
  
  Thank you for all of the documents.  I am expecting that we will be able to turn another draft out tomorrow (Tuesday) but I do want Sam to see it before it goes out and I have not made contact with him today (Monday).  I will touch base with you again tomorrow on timing.  I am using very little of the original draft and instead, am using almost everything that you sent to us.

  The outline of notes from Alan and Mike that you sent to me seemed to reference Mike Roan's comments.  I have the ouline with Alan's comments and their joint outline but I do not have a stand alone document for Mike Roan. 
I
  will work with what I have but if you do have a separate document from Mike and want me to use it, could you please send it to me if you  have a free minute?  The other material from Alan and Mike seems helpful.  

Thanks very much,

Cathy

Attached are:

1.  The outline I e-mailed you previously, with Alan Comnes' comments.
Basically Alan has added a Section II, which arguably could be
incorporated into Section IV of the previous outline.  

2.  An outline of some notes from Alan Comnes and Mike Roan (both
economists).  Some of these points may be useful to add; please do so at
your discretion.

3.  EPSA's draft comments for your information (could not remember
whether I had forwarded them to you).

Hi Moms,
If you have some time on Tuesday afternoon, we  could use some additional hands at the Brownie meeting.  One of our  projects will be to make a "sit-upon".  The girls will be lacing and  beading and we think some extra hands to help will be necessary.   Please reply if you can make it.  We probably will be  starting the project around 3:50 or 4pm.  
Sorry for the late notice and thanks in  advance,
Joy Lee

You are playing Line 3 at 8:15.  The park (Oaks of Woodlake) is on the corner
of Ella Lee and Tanglewilde.   Ella Lee is one block north of Westheimer
(Between Briar Forest and Westheimer).  And Tanglewilde is one block east of
Gessner.  Park on the Tanglewilde side (there is a small parking lot or you
can park on the street).  Please bring water.  They have a water fountain,
but no ice.   I'm sorry you have to keep playing the late match, but that's
the way the lines keep working out.  I won't be playing, so would it be
possible for you to keep the scoresheet?  You can sign as captain, and I'll
just get the scoresheet from you when I see you.  Maureen Garrett will be
playing Line 4 at 7:00pm, and she can show you how the scoresheet works if
you have any questions.  Thanks a lot!

Cindy

 
Here is an unproofed draft of examples.  Please forward to the appropriate people at LLG.  Thanks

Hi Cindy

We are playing Wednesday (10/3) at Oaks of Woodlake (near Westheimer and

Gessner).

2 Lines @ 7:00

Hi Bob
 
Thanks for the invite - Unfortunately (likely for me only ... I haven't hit a golf ball since the last time I played with you), I will not be able to make it on the 17th- maybe next time. Thanks again.
Elizaabeth Sager

From those that have responded (Scott, Mike, and Richard) it looks like October 17 or October 19 are the two best days.  There are still spaces available! 

Chris Ferrazzi Bill Wiggins and Gene Nettles want to play golf with you at Champions!  I told them a weekday would probably be most palatable.  Please let me know if you are interested and if so what time and days would work for you.  Thanks.

Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response

Answering Susan's question, the EPMI's draft comments on the reporting requirement NOPR are in fact consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill.  As initially drafted, that bill would essentially require FERC to do what it proposes in this NOPR to under its existing discretionary authority.  We have used many of the arguments in the draft comments in our discussions against this aspect of the Bingaman draft.

Attached is a draft of EPMI's comments on the Reporting Requirements NOPR.  Alan Comnes and I will be working with ENA Legal on some revisions to the draft and will circulate those revisions within the next few days.  Of course we would welcome your comments at any time.  John, I assume this is consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill but let us know if anything needs to be changed.  

EPMI's comments are due next Friday, October 5. 

Susan Lindberg

  Attached are the draft comments.  I apologize for the delay.  We were distracted by the FERC meeting - exciting day.  You all must be happy about the Commission's discussions on RTOs but uncertain about the market power initiatives.

   Please call Sam or me with any comments on the filing.  

Thank you,

Hi Scott

Enron was heavily involved in the EEI.

Anything and everything in the EEI can be changed.  I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.  We also add others from time to time.  Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.  Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.  On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.  (We were under tremendous pressure to "release" the document - after release we do not want to "re-release" unless something is misleading.)  If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page. 

   This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendments

Elizabeth Sager

Elizabeth:

I am one of the contract attorneys from Bracewell & Patterson  assisting EES on various projects.  One of the matters which has been delegated to me is the review of a Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement between EES and A'lones.  I met with Richard Ring yesterday, and he indicated that you might be able to answer a few questions.  

First, Richard has informed me that ENA was heavily involved in the development of this document, and, as a result, the form is used "as is" and without amendment, save for information to be provided in the Cover Sheet.  One of my "marching orders" is that choice of law provisions in EES paper should require Texas law.  The Edison form opts for New York.  Is this something that can be changed? 

Second, what about more substantive matters, such as who takes the lead in sending transaction confirmations?  In the A'lones transaction, it is contemplated that EES will be the Buyer.  The Edison form places primary confirmation obligations on the Seller.  I am informed that EES prefers to be the confirming party, regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller.  Is this something that can be changed?

Third, there are a variety of typographical and reference errors.  i.e. double commas (see paragraph 2.2), doubled phrases (paragraph 5.1(h)(i)), and possibly mistaken use of defined terms (see use of "Product" in second line of paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2).  What is the Company's position on correcting these types of items?

I apologize that this is being e-mailed, as it would probably be quicker by phone, but my connection to the phone system is lagging somewhat behind my connection to the computer network.  Thank you for your time and attention.

Elizabeth -

Here are the comments from me and Dede. I have given it to our Credit Dept.
and asked for comments but I doubt they will have much to add. Call me if
you have any questions with what we wrote.

With regard to the full-blown WSPP Collateral Annex, Dede and I think it
would be better to get the EEI one in a final form before converting it
over to fit into the WSPP. Otherwise, we could be revising the 2 documents
in parallel.

I am planning to get the short draft WSPP Collateral Annex over to you
today.

Thanks!

To All:
 
Please let me know your availability for a conference call  next week on 10/1-10/3 or 10/5 at 2pm Eastern TIme to discuss the  following:
 
1) Getting a EEI Contract Working Group organizational plan in  place asap.  The best antidote for preventing an Energy Industry Standards  Board from taking over the EEI Contract management is to have a separate,  well-defined and broadly-supported group in place.
 
3) Agenda and schedule for the next meeting of the Working  Group.
 
3) Adding new members to the drafting committe.  In  particular, Noel Trask of the Excelon Power Team has asked to join.
 
ASAP, I would like to get the optional provisions  circulated earlier this week up on the website and through the listserver   along w/ the announcement of our organizational proposal and future working  group meetings.
 
Thanks.

Hope all is well with you, Tracy and the kids.  How is Addy (opps, spelling is bound to be wrong)?  Are you coming to the legal conference?  And now for the real reason of my email - Can you send me Tracy's telephone number.  I've been wanting to call her for months and say hi but the stupor got in my mind and I couldn't shake it free. Its a beautiful day here today - the first for months and I'm committing to a new .... well, at least a call to Tracy.  Hope to see you at the legal conference.  Did you hear I have to speak?  At least it is with Klauberg.

FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW
  
09/24/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday. 
"I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market," concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case. 
The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said. 
"Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on," Cintron said. 
Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region. 
"The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers," the judge said. 
The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case. 
     
At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001. 
In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. 
The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December. 
Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission. 
"Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market," Cintron concluded. "This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner." 
"Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard," Cintron said. 
California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million). 
Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds. 
Cintron was persuaded by the "ripple" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds. 
"Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task," Cintron said. 
"The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market," the judge said. 
"Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale," she said. 
The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed. 
In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market. 
While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices. 
Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.

To ensure that you are not embarrassed or surprised by anyone, this is where we are with Consumers.
	
Marcus

A quick update on where we are:

We have asked for documents from Consumers and should be getting those in the next week or so.  We have also asked to take the depositions of the two Consumers' bookkeepers who allegedly made the "payment mistake."  Those should take place in the next three to four weeks.  To date, Consumers has not indicated a desire to conduct any discovery whatsoever.  Unbelievable.  Our counsel believes that Consumers doesn't really think this case will be arbitrated; but rather is hoping that as we approach an arbitration date, we will become much more willing to compromise.  As far as an arbitration date is concerned, nothing is set yet. We have agreed to approach the arbitrator (Professor White) after the depositions and check his calendar for available dates. I do think that, given Consumers cash-poor situation, they will attempt to get this matter resolved by year-end.  

Call me with questions.  Otherwise, I will keep you updated.

Andy

As most of you know Genia will be out of the office for a period of approximately 4 weeks from the 4th October. 

During this period Alice Wright will, in addition to her other responsibilities, be available to assist in the preparation of cover sheets and other aspects of work normally performed by Genia. However, while Alice has spent some time with Genia over the past few weeks gaining an understanding of the preparation of EEI Cover Sheets, this is a new area for her and she will require both our assistance and patience.

During this period, for example, it is likely that the attorneys will, from time to time, need to complete cover sheets using the credit work sheet and I would encourage all of you to spend some time with Genia to make sure that, if required, you will be able to perform this task. There are clearly other agreements which we all ask Genia to prepare and  any such agreements should be prepared by the attorneys until Genia's return.

Our 1st grade Brownie troop is starting up!   During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!

 

A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.  

Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a "Scouting for Food" patch.

 

The specifics are:

Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.

Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026

A parent needs to accompany each  child.

Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764

 

There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.

 

Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.

 

If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

 

FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

 

Troop #12478 Leaders - Claire, Sheryl, Barbara and  Joy

I think so too... 

I think Mary's idea is good - like with Calpine, we can just let them know that the draft is only for consideration.

I am overloaded on end of quarter deals and market disruption etc.  I suggest just sending out the current status of the form to begin negotiations, with the suggestion by comment that the parties may wish to develop a CSA type of attachment.  Then I can catch up to you on the flip side and Tanya will see that things are moving forward.  What do you think?  

Mary and Elizabeth:
Tanya is desperate for me to send something to Williams and I keep putting her off.  I have run out of delay tactics.  Any suggestions on what I should send out?

As part of its efforts to assist the markets resolve certain issues arising
out of this week's events, ISDA has been asked to consider the implications
of certain continuing problems with futures exchanges and price source
publications for commodity derivatives.

Attached in the form of a draft statement from ISDA are a series of
proposals that have been made by a number of institutions active in the OTC
commodity derivatives area to resolve pricing difficulties.

We welcome your comments on these proposals.  The purpose of this
distribution is to encourage all participants in the markets for these
products to consider the issues raised and, we hope, to come to some
consensus position that can be reflected in a statement in the style of the
attached draft by ISDA.  Please send any comments to Kimberly Summe
(ksumme@isda.org) as soon as possible on Friday morning.

Please contact me at ISDA at 212-332-1203 if you have any questions.

Hi Peter
 
I am going to be out of the office the rest of this week but lets talk early next week about this .  Thanks
Elizabeth

Elizabeth, please call me to let me know how you want to proceed on this. 

I reviewed with Mary last week the set-of language for the trading forms in light of Robert Anderson's review and suggested revisions.  Mary had reviewed the language with your outside counsel and for reasons, most of which I did not necessarily follow to be honest, they were not agreeable to Robert's suggested revisions (other than the "without limitation" language (which I note has now been inserted only in part, and therefore may still problematic, in that it refers to being without limitation to either party's rights, which would include the defaulting party's right to object to the enforceability of the entire set-off provision or to assert some alternate form of set-off arrangement)).  I agreed with Mary that I would again review that matter with Robert.

I have again reviewed the matter with Robert, and he remains concerned with the language as is, since the triangular set-off as proposed without also dealing with the issue of mutuality, which is fundamental to the concept of set-off, results in a contractual agreement (assuming that we get past the privity and consideration issues), to call something "set-off" that fundamentally is not set-off.  Robert's concern is that if the issue of mutuality is not addressed the current language could be viewed by a court not as set-off but as an assignment of a third obligation as security, that may be unenforceable for various reasons, including non-perfection.

Robert also makes the following points: 

1.  His suggested revisions already are a compromise from what he believes would be required in a more detailed provision addressing these complex issues;

2.  To the extent that we introduce triangular set-off that may not ultimately be enforceable, we are running the risk of the entire clause not be allowed by the courts, and therefore having no right to set-off;

3.  As drafting points, the "without limitation" language still provides the defaulting party with an argument to avoid the entire arrangement, and there is no specified date for the currency conversion;

4.  In terms of the issue of consideration, it is an issue of contract formation, which is fundamental to a contractual right of set-off;

5.  In terms of when the mutuality of the obligations arises, he is agrees that it would be best that it arise form inception, but he thought that would be difficult to sell commercially, and therefore setled on default but prior to elected termination.

In short, Robert's point is that even with his revisions he would have concerns, but without his revisions he has serious concerns around enforceability, and it is difficult for me to simply ignore his advice given both his reasoning and my experience with Robert's advice.

In terms of where to go, I think there are the following solutions: 

1.  We can see this as a Canadian issue, and therefore incorporate Robert's changes in the Canadian forms only - physical and financial;

2.  We can have Robert speak to your outside counsel and see if they can't come to some common ground on more universal language;

3.  We can leave the matter as is for all forms. 

(I am more comfortable with 1 than 3.) 

Why don't you give me a call.  I am sure we all want to move past this and, ackowledginging the risks, simply need to agree on a definitive approach.

Peter.

HI 

So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  

ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.

Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.

Elizabeth Sager
713-853-6349

I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours.  Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs, munis, and federal PMA's I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract, it's almost a religion.  One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran.

Whether it's assimilation or merger, or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education, we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract.  Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract.---"Why should I change, the agreements are virtually identical?"

Elizabeth, 

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers "talking points"  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories. 

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of "How Enron views the WSPP" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.   

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements. 

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions. 

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.   

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result. 
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.   ----cgy  

Christian Yoder has graciously agreed to host a symposium comparing and contrasting the WSPP and the EEI.  The meeting will take place on Oct 31 (Halloween) at 1:00 PM in Mt Bachelor.

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what "suggestions" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.  So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something different?

I sold the 10 MW off peak to STEC.  Enpower 796442.  I thought the length was in the Asset book, but it appeared that the lenth was in the Ercot Mngmnt book.  So I put the sale in that book to keep everyone flat.  I did not make any other changes to Enpower.

Hello, I'm pretty flexible about food.  All of the things you mentioned sound good, so I can just eat the same stuff you guys do.  See ya in a few days!

Eric

Hi eric, 
I just wanted to write and ask what type of foods you like to eat.  Especially breakfast foods.  I don't normally keep food in the house (and the food I do have is ancient and/or not that great - Ask Adnan!), so I wanted to know what you like so I can go grocery shopping and actually cook this weekend :-)   
Are you a simple guy, or are you a bit complex?  I only have cereal, which is what I eat daily.  But I'm sure you have different tastes. Adnan likes to have his coffee w/ a pastry on weekdays and banana pancakes w/ eggs, fruit and bacon on weekends, so I have that taken care of, but I need to know what you like.   
Another thing... We don't want you to worry about spending money on food.  You'll be well taken care of.  We won't let you go hungry.   
Anyways... hope your excited...  :-) 
Talk to you later, 
Maylynn

Here is my homework following Carson's format as best I could.  Let me know if I need to change/add anything.  Thanks.

Eric

Boys, 

I'd be delighted to gather and format all of the information for a "nice and pretty" presentation. I would just ask that you e-mail me your info by the end of Wednesday, Feb. 6. 

Gracias,
Maria

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

Hey there,

Hope everything is going well.  I have some bad news.  In case you have not heard, my Dad passed on a week ago Sunday.  I was in LA for Adnan's wedding when my brother called.  Drove up to SF Sunday night, funeral was Monday afternoon.  I stayed in SF for a couple days, but there wasn't much I needed to do.  My brother is and will be taking care of paperwork and my Dad's apt and stuff like that.  So I drove back down to LA and stayed there for a couple days before returning to Houston.

Life at Enron is pretty down these days.  I am very fortunate to still be employed.  As you prob know of the Houston employees were cut loose last Monday.  On Friday they swiped about half of ENA.  It was a bit of a shocker.  I thought layoffs would be minimal around this group.  Origination is almost non existant now.  Some good people I worked with or out.  Since I wasn't here Friday, I was really nervous coming in.  But I think it's ok for now.

They are in negotiations with a few banks to buy the floor, or what is left of it.  They'll probably form a new patnership with a new name and everything.  Honestly, I think that is llikely to happen.  It's just a question of what will be left by the time that all happens.

I see on my streamer that CPN is down to 18 1/4.  Ouch.  Morgan Stanley downgraded the whole sector, what a bunch of geniuses.  Let's just hope for the best.

Ok then drop me a line when you have a chance.  My home address is esaibi@houston.rr.com in case Enron bites the dust.  Later

HI, i'm scheduled to arrive at 1:25 PM on Nov 30, flight 1287.  Looking forward to it!

Eric

Hi Eric
 
Quick question?
 
What time will you be arriving at LAX?  I need to know so that I can ask for part of the day off. 
 
Thanks,
Maylynn J

Here's the load mix for Southern and TVA, for the region and top 5, in case you haven't gotten that far yet.  Don't understand why TVA (the utility) has no res/com load, but that's what PowerDat had.  Enjoy.

Sorry, Continental.

What airline?

Listen, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.  That was not my intention.  I still care about you.  How could I not?  We were together for so long.  I'm just uncertain right now, about what type of relationship I would like to have with you.  I don't know.  Ok, thanks for listening.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. 

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years. 

Ken Lay 

Hey there, I got a call from Marta in your HR about some type of "Financial Portfolio Managment" deal.  The VP is TIm Kramer.  It sounded like some type of Risk and Control, analytical position as opposed to trading.  So I told here I was not interested for now.  Anyway just wondering if you knew anything about this group, if it's something I should look at.  Thanks buddy.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a new 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron's Internet-based transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron's increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized expertise in financial risk management.

In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City. 

Enron Freight Markets
In March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, Inc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business.  EFM also started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its first month.

East Power Origination
On Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the Midway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt peaking power plant.  Next steps for this facility include receiving a water permit from the South Florida Water Management District and an Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Enron Canada
Ken Lay addressed a breakfast meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade on Wednesday, April 4, as part of the "Power Breakfast Series".  His topic was "Moving Forward with Electricity Deregulation."  Before his speech, the chairman of the Board of Trade commented that "this was the best attendance ever" at one of their breakfast meetings.  After the meeting, Mr. Lay spoke with reporters from Reuters, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and Report on Business TV emphasizing Enron's commitment to deregulation of the Ontario power market.

IN THE NEWS

JAPAN: Enron presents power plant plan to Japan government
TOKYO, U.S.-based Enron Corp on Wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in Japan. The move brings Enron one step closer to realizing its plan to build a power plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in Aomori prefecture.
"We submitted our basic plan to build the plant to the governor of Aomori prefecture today in line with last November's announcement," Tatsuro Seguchi, president of Enron Corp's Japanese affiliate Encom Corp, told a news conference. "We are aiming to start construction of the plant in 2004 and start operations by 2007 since Japan's power market is one of our highest priorities," he said.    03/28/2001  Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2001.

I need some quick education on transmission.  In a paragraph or two can you explain how you go about deciding what transmission to buy for a given schedule.  

I need to get a take on the over all strategy when buying transmission.  Is it based mostly on price and location?

Steve at Pac says he spoke with Jeremy about the cut on Sunday.

Monika Causholli
04/16/2001 04:49 AM
We had a very strange cut today starting HE 1-6. Tag # 016370L where the gen is EPE- E-CISO-PACE   happened to be a cancelled tag and none of the counterparties including us did not know anything. After spending hours on the phone with CISO and PAC John @ PACE found that this tag had been replaced by tag 16381N   but none knew anything about it. This tag was for 78 MW and it was done by a PACE prescheduler.  We were trying to find a new sink in the meantime so before this new tag was found the following went RT

HE 01 78 MW to APS  (APS took the power)
HE 02 sank with LADWP @ $0. I agreed with John at PACE that we are going to charge PAC for HE 1-2 LDs
Then for HE 3-6  the power was sent to PACE for the original deal price at PV.

John at PACE was going to leave good notes to his prescheduler about this cut. I did not do anything HA to manage the cut (in enpower, Lotus notes ) as JOhn at PACE did not consider this a HA cut but a DA cut that nobody knew about. We left it up to the preschedulers to agree on this cut.

if you have questions ask me,
Monika

Hello,

I need one ticket to Las Vegas leaving on Friday 4/20 and returning Sunday 4/22.  I have a ticket reserved through my travel agent leaving Portland at 4:20pm and returning on Sunday at 12:30pm.  I reserved this yesterday as the spaces seemed to be filling up.  The price on this is $550 round trip.  My only need is to be back Sunday on an early flight.  I can hold this ticket for a few days.  Let me know if you can do better on the price and I will cancel the reservation.  If not let me know and I will book it.

Thanks,
Holden

We have a receipt from CRC at Mead to fulfill the other 25mw's.  Also we have a light load receipt at Four Corners from EPE that we are wheeling on APS transmission to fulfill the light load at Pinnacle Peak.

Holden

Your table shows a short of 25 RTC (vice HLH) at Pinnacle Peak.  In
addition, we are only buying 25 HLHat Mead 230, but have a short of 50 HLH??

Steve
This is everything for PNM.  We still need to buy 25mw heavy load at
Pinnacle Peak.  PNM did everything else.  I will send you a complete email
as soon as we procure the last piece.

Thank you,

The Enron PGE Park Committee (comprised of some employees from the groups above) is working together to ensure equitable distribution of tickets so that everyone on the floor will have an opportunity to attend games. 

In order to allocate tickets in the most beneficial way to those who are interested, please respond to the following questions by Monday afternoon, April 30.  If you would prefer to reply verbally, stop by Debra's desk and she will write them down.  Debra also has information about the games if you have questions.

Are you interested in attending any Timbers soccer games?  
If yes to Timbers games, about how many games would you like to attend?  
If yes to Timbers games, how many tickets would you be interested in getting?

Are you interested in attending any Beavers baseball games?  
If yes to Beavers games, about how many games would you like to attend? 
If yes to Beavers games, how many tickets would you be interested in getting for each game?

If you have no interest in attending Beavers or Timbers games, please let Debra know.

Keep in mind that there must be at least one Enron employee with guests.  Tickets cannot be given away or sold.  Contact Debra if you have any questions.

I would like to attend this class.

Thank You,
Holden

We will be offering Derivatives I training on-site.  If you are interested in attending, please let Amy FitzPatrick know no later than May 21st.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:  		Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:		8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum prices, etc.

I have purchased 78mw of transmission monthly firm from APS for May , Palo Verde to West Wing.  The oasis number is 21253 and the deal number is 594301.  This replaces the daily transmission that I had previously purchased.

I also reserved 50mws of tranny monthly firm from APS, Palo Verde to Four Corners 345.  This is from 5/2 - 5/31.  Oasis # is 21254, deal number is 597347.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 2nd

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

REGARDING THIS TEST, A QUESTION HAS ARISEN ABOUT ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN
SHOULD ANOTHER (NONTEST) UNIT TRIP DURING THE PERIOD WHEN AGC IS
SUSPENDED FOR THE TEST.
The CMOPS Chair, the Test Director and WSCC Staff discussed this
question and all are agreed that the control area(s) affected by
tripping of a unit not intended as part of the test should return AGC
to service and attempt to meet DCS requirements.

Bill Comish
WSCC

To all WSCC Control Area operators

This is the 7 day notice of WSCC System test on May 8, 2001
for the proposed Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR)
 Operating Policy obtaining the system response information
 under the existing MORC spinning reserve policy.

The WSCC is proposing changes to the Operating Reserve policy
 that would change Spinning Reserve practices to newly proposed
 Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR). The new policy specifies
 the minimum MW component of FRR that should be achievable in
 60 seconds. A Summer(Fall) test is also being planned for June 7.

**
During the generator dropping tests all WSCC Control Areas are to
 suspend AGC 3 minutes prior and restore 4 minutes after the
 generator trips.

This is to have unhindered governor response throughout the system.
**

The test sequence is similar to the June 2000 WSCC System Test

WSCC Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR) generator dropping test
 May 8 (light loading)

All times are in Pacific Advanced Time (PAT) and are subject to change
 when the tests are finalized.

May 8, 2001

1250	Make final preparations for compliance with test objectives
		to be completed not later than 13:10

1310	Start continuous sampling of SCADA data (2 second sampling if
possible)

1315	Chief Joseph Dynamic Brake Test 1

1317	AGC suspended and disable plant setpoint control at Hoover.
1320	Hoover (750 MW) generation trip
1324	AGC on
		and restore generation setpoint control to normal
1325	Start Hoover generation ramp-up
	 (restore to pretest level within 5 minutes.)

1337	 AGC suspended and disable setpoint control at NW RAS
1340	NW RAS (1250 MW) generation trip
1344	AGC on
		and restore NW RAS generation setpoint control to normal
1345 	Start NW generation ramp-up
	 (restore to pretest level within 5 minutes.)

1350	Stop continuous recording of SCADA data

1415	Chief Joseph Dynamic Brake Test 2 (Tentative)
1420	PDCI Mid-Level Probing Signal Test sequence
	 (Four 2-minute tests), Tentative
1440	Finish test

Each control area is requested to complete the Frequency Responsive
Reserve Survey
form for each of the two generator tripping tests.  Refer to the
instructions in
the April 16, 2001 letter e-mailed to the WSCC Area coordinators.

Good Evening,

We just completed the Chapter 11 application to zero-out the schedule volume on selected deals.  The new executable is located at  o:\portland\westdesk\california scheduling\chap11.exe.

We did some preliminary testing with Phil Platter and all looks good.  We will migrate the new application to production on Monday using the traditional method so that it will be accessible from the Enpower toolbar.

Phil can show you how to create the short-cut.

Thanks,  David Poston

Thanks Dave

Good Afternoon,

We have just completed the first part of the application requested this afternoon that will zero-out the schedule strip volumes for deals selected through this new program.  The program I am sending you now only selects deals.  The ability to zero-out the schedules will be available in about an hour.  However, we want to get the program out to you guys as soon as possible so that you can find any potential bugs.

Thanks,  David Poston

7.  Lastly, double-click the short-cut and the application should come-up.

 

ps - Mike Tully will be available to help if you have any problems.

I would like to attend.

Please let me know if you would be interested in attending a Derivatives III course in Portland (next year).

(We are working to create a training calendar for 2002 and would like to be sure we have enough interest to offer DIII next year.)

Thanks!

Yes, I would.

Holden, let me know if you want to sign up for this fantastic opportunity.
 
Anybody have candidates for this?
 
Tim
 
A Developmentor manager has an introductory VB class locally that he is trying to fill.  I took a COM+/2000 class from them in December, and they are first class.  How many of us would be interested (no commitment at this point)?
 
I believe this is Developmentor's 12/3 one-week course (see  <http://www.develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=10>)  It ordinarily goes for $1800 per person.
 
Mike N, can you give me some guidance regarding how much cost per person or how much cost total you would be prepared to pay.  Again, he is trying to fill up a class that is about to be cancelled, and I think he would be willing to negotiate.
 
Tim, would you or anyone on your floor have any interest in this?
 
Michael

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

I would like for this product to trade for Sunday and Monday together.  It would be like the Sunday-Monday light load product that now exists except we are stripping out the HE 7-22 on Sunday.  Therefore I would like to include the non-holiday Monday.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Also, any word on the Pinnacle Peak delivery point?  We do not need to provide a bus as this is a common delivery point.
 
Thank You,
Holden

Looks okay so long as Holden confirms that he want the delivery days to cover Sunday and Monday only.  I get Monday if the Monday is a holiday.  Holden, do you also want to cover a non-holiday Monday?
 
Leslie

Leslie, 

Please take a look at this loadshape as well for Hoden Salisbury: 

OffPk 8hr  PPT 

The transaction is for the hours on each Delivery Day (i) beginning with the hour ending 0100 (12:00 am midnight) and concluding with the hour ending 0600 (6:00 am) and (ii) beginning with the hour ending 2300 (10:00 pm) and concluding with the hour ending 2400 (12:00 am midnight) (8 hours each day) Pacific Prevailing Time.  "Delivery Day" means a day during the term of the transaction that is a Sunday or Monday, including any day that is a NERC holiday.

Thank you,

The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system.  

Holden,

SRP is comming back saying that they do not see deal 805316 on 9/12.  Can you look into this

That is it.  We are currently out by this amount at Craig in the postion manager.  Let Tom or Mark know if you have any questions, or call me.

Holden,

  Can you (Mark or Tom) provide any off-the-top-of-your-head information about El Paso?  Marina is doing a project in school and had the following question:

Virginia,

I am doing homework now, and I need your help. For my finance class, we are 
investing for real a 1 million $ in the stock market, my sector is Energy 
and I am doing a recommendation on Thursday this week. I am trying to decide 
between 2 stocks: one is El Paso Corp, the other one is Philips Petroleum. I 
know we do business with El Paso. Any valuable info that you can provide me 
with will be a great help (i.e. are they a good customer, how are they doing 
in your opinion, that type of info).
Sorry to bother you with this but it is really important. I will be making 
my presentation in front of the Trustees of the fund.

Thanks,

Marina

alrighty then......just let me now what the new deal number is  and i'll close out this dispute......

Thank you

I do remember this deal, we were forced to bookout by some a-hole at pinwest because of the disaster and our inability to secure a scheule from DYPMI and Morgan who was upstream of AEP who was scheduling from home (as was I).  Tom  did the deal with Pinwest our buy for $40, and I did the deal with DYPMI our sale at Index.  I told the SW guys about this the following day, and in the mayhem, the deals probably did not get put in.  Holden and Tom and Mark were all aware of this at the time, and one of them may have also modified our deal with DYPMI.

They can throw those deals in, or I can.  Just let me know.

Cara

Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the sheets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and Staci remembers the problem.    

Let me know when we can talk about this

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 

?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

I have noticed that your seven day forecast has not been updated for several days.

Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website. These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.

Stack Manager Changes

Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website. 

If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font.

To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose "Inactivate Stack". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose "Activate Stack". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons.

					 

Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website. Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive. Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.

Website Change

Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.

If you have any questions please call me at 31787. Thanks.

Holden-

  Can you look at deal # 702460.1.  This is priced at $2.70 adn all other tranny for hte month is at $2.84.
  Can you confirm what the price is or if there is a special deal this day?

  I think the OASIS # is 17737

We have the approval from the business unit (Matt Motley) to implement Index Option deal type as such:

Index Option will be a physical option with a strike @ an Index.
For a BDay option expiry the analysis will work as follows:

The forward position will be valued taking the deal strip hours, these hours
will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared
to the forward underlying price will be estimated as exercised. Only the hours
in the money will be evaluated.  For the day of exercise the hours evaluated will
be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.

This is how we would analyze each hour.  
The sum of each hour will be the value of the option.

For each hour:
HE7 = 
Strike = Forward Price (since Index is not available)
Underlying = Forward Price * scalar
Vol = Daily Vol
Rate = Libor
Time = same as daily (treated as a daily option for time)

Vo =f(u,s,v,r,t)
V = Intrinsic + Extrinsic

Matt I need written confirmation regarding the analysis of the new Deal Type "Index Option" for IT to implement.

Index Option will be a physical option with a strike @ an Index.
For a BDay option expiry the analysis will work as follows:

The forward position will be valued taking the deal strip hours, these hours
will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared
to the forward underlying price will be estimated as exercised. Only the hours
in the money will be evaluated.  For the day of exercise the hours evaluated will
be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Buy Call: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price above the mid
Buy Put: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price below the mid

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.

Update...

The Internal Communications department has not yet released the original video. I don't have an ETA at this time.

I would like to have a feel for how many people are still interested in viewing this meeting. Please send me an email if you are interested in viewing the replay of the All Employee Meeting. I will then communicate with those who are interested. DO NOT select reply to all as it will go to all Calgary and Portland employees.

Regards,

Dan

All,

The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday. There were several IT teams (your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams) that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised. I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audio/video streaming services.

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application. This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October 2001 which was set by business. Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug, 16 (today). This didn't provide much time for preparation and testing. During the troubleshooting for each of your sites, the Network team (Scott Shishido and George Nguyen) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance. I will be meeting with the Web (Edward Ray) and Network (Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues.

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so. I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

Dan Dietrich

I would never do that.  That transmission is not mine.  The only Nevada tranny that I used that day is Enpowered under #'s 702461 abd 704751.

Thanks

Holden,

Do you ever call in NPC (t) with out a reservation.  NPC has two blocks of 400 mw's for the 27th and 28th and I don't know who did it and it is not in Enpower.  It looks like it could have been preschedule with the shape of it.  There isn't anything in the real time sheet.

Guys-

   FYI  --  Public Service Company of New Mexico charges ancillary as follows:

  Schedule 1    Scheduling, System Control, and Dispatch Services -  $0.047 per MWh
  Schedule 2    Reactive Supply and Voltage Control - $0.066 per MWh
  Schedule 9    Loss Compensation Service - $3.00 per MWh.  This $3 is based on a $100 market price x 3%.  I have disputed this charge, arguing that the market (and as you mentioned the Cap) is well below $100.00.  I should be hearing from them soon and I will let you know when I do.  That could bring down  your total ancillary cost from July 2001 going forward.
  New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax - 5.75% of gross charges for the month.  This taxes applied to all schedules that remain within New Mexico. )For   example from Four Corners to San Juan).

Attached is a spreadsheet outlining this month's charges as of today (not accounting for any changes that may come in response to my dispute).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello,

I am trading for Enron West Power and am curious if we are set up to view your trading screens.  If so what is the login procedure and if not what is required to do so.

Thank You,

The prices on deals  683397 were 672851 changed and the deals now need to be autoscheduled.  Can one of you please take care of this?  If a price is changed outside of a certain window, the deal then needs to be autoscheduled in order for it to go to Unify.  Gwen Williams will submit a DMS entry for these deals.

Here are the purchases we made for next week.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Holden

 

So how should these deals be Enpowered in the future?  Cara has wisely warned me not to Enpower multiple strips to avoid this double counting.

Mark, Tom, and Holden,

In reference to the DPR impacts of $ 132,000 (WAPA) and $133,000 (SRP) that you were expecting, here is an explanation of why you will not be seeing that in your PMA's:

The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.  

deal #  539126: 3 strips @ 2216 = 199,500 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $66,500).
deal #  538832: 3 strips @ 2180 = 196,200 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $65,400) .

Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.  

When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.

Here is a discription of the Risk - Settlements process:
Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.

So the question was: When it came to recognizing a variance in Settlements, why weren't we seeing a + amount back to your books for 2 of the strips that I zero'd out? 

Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....

Heather Dunton and I did alot of searching for the answer and we found that:  When Risk flashed these deals in April, they flashed them according to a single MW month charge.  Regardless of how many strips there are, the deal is set up as a MW month and should, therefore, calculate as one single charge for the month. 

We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal). 

 The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.

When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.  

I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future. 

Thanks for your patience while we figured this out.
Let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks,

 Virginia

$35 is correct, I changed it.

LD Mirant for the loss of revenue due to cutting the schedule.  As long as we are kept whole financially then there should not be an issue.  Please let me know if you need any more info.  I assume that you will do the annuity but let me know if you want me to.  

Thanks,

Dear ST_SW Traders,

FYI - 
There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.  It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.  Mirant is at fault for the cut. (our up-stream is PAC).  
We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.  (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).  

We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.  They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)  We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.

It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.

Just wanted to let you know and get your input.

I have purchased 11mw of firm monthly transmission from Mead 230 to West Wing 500.  The enpower deal number is 671184 and the oasis number is 21397.

I am in the Portland office and using Foster.  When I run the transmission report I get an SQL error that I have enclosed a screen shot of.  Also I cannot run the batch scheduler.  Please let me know if you can help.

Thank You,

WALC refers to the Pinnacle Peak delivery we are currently performing on.  In Enpower it is referred to as:  Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region - WALC.  The deal number is 705583.  Please let me know if you need any more information.

Thank you,
Holden

I will confirm deal numbers with the desk.  Its our understanding (per the 1:30 CST call) that we are continuing to make deliveries to WALC, which is WAPADESERTSW, and Edwards AFB, which is believed to be WAPADESERTSWAFB.  We will definitively identify WAPADESERTSW and Edwards deal numbers.

    If we assume that  
      47358	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region	            WAPADESERTSW
and 98773	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	WAPADESERTSWAFB

were terminated as well only the desks of two deals  852890 and 853003 should be changed
from EPMI Long Term Southwest to EPMI - West Performance 

Casey, can you do that with Deal Entry for me please so I can avoid one long procedure for two deals.

Thanks,
Kroum

I am not sure of your question, but DESERETGENTRAN has been terminated.  

 Stephen,

Now we have the question
if the deals with

29894	Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop.	DESERETGENTRAN

or 

      47358	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region	            WAPADESERTSW
and 98773	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	WAPADESERTSWAFB

had to be on the list

As a matter of fact we are talking for fixing maximum 6 deals:
(Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop. was not changed in two only)

Deal No
552607	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region		EPMI - West Performance 
622299	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	EPMI - West Performance 
638076	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	EPMI - West Performance 
705583	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region		EPMI - West Performance 
852890	Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop.				EPMI Long Term Southwest
853003	Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop.				EPMI Long Term Southwest

which could be done with Deal Entry as well

Thanks,
Kroum

WAPA Deseret is probably associated with Deseret G&T.  I suspect WAPA is purchasing power on behalf of the G&T to meet its obligations.

Kroum,

Hopefully this helps:

WALC - WAPA Lower Colorado - Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region
WAMP - WAPA Municipal Power-NP15 - Western Area Power Administration - Sacramento Area Office
WAPA Deseret - Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	

It looks like the only one you haven't run is the WAPA Sacramento Area Office.

Let me know if you have any more questions.  Thanks.

Steve

I spoke with Bloomberg's Paul Callahan.  He confirmed that all daily trades are a $15 flat fee.  On the case of a spread trade like we executed yesterday the $15 flat fee still applys.  Although a spread trade implies two trades, only $15 is charged for the whole package.  Please let me know if you have any more questions.  Also, what do we need to do to change the default in Enpower to better reflect the fee structure.  I believe that term trades are still on the old rate basis.

Given all of the recent news about California-related litigation, I thought that it would be a good idea to hold an information session for people on the desk about what is happening with Enron on this front.  I have asked Richard Sanders, who is ENA's chief litigation lawyer, to make a special trip to Portland to talk to us about it.  He will be prepared to review the foundation of all of the current lawsuits that are ongoing and what these lawsuits mean to Enron and to us as traders and marketers.  

I strongly encourage you to come to this meeting as I think that you'll find it very useful.

Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email. Perspective comes quickly
at 8000 meters and today, thinking back on the ascent and all the rock
climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my
perpetually clumsy condition (wrsened by AMS), I am happy to be alive. The
weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and
dying, including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for
the north side. By the time i am allowed to send this, the media will have
already begun reporting on this tragedy. I was slowed by my vomiting and had
i continued, i likely would have been trudging up with this group.

In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends: ensuring
his safety so suz and i could take a vacation. He is stuck on the ridge now,
dying, and will likely be dead by morning. One of our strongest guides is
with him and he, too, will probably die. This guy is super strong but the
altitude has snatched him. We're in shock here and can do nothing but stare
into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight. I have been
assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives. A
member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning, 3
Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge, and a spaniard is flirting
with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema, despite Chris
Warner's valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night. When i
think of this mountain now, i think only of death.

Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first time
he has unleashed the team for our own. It is a totaly professional
logistical operation (locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up
into the jet stream), relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly
strong. Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come. The
guide and the client spent the night on the ridge (8650 meters), incoherent
and immobile, freezing, but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a
desperate stumble home, climbed the second step (brutal) for the second time
in 10 hours, and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark.
Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes, reaching
top camp (8300 meters...still incredibly dangerous) at 11:30 pm. It was a
relatively warm night (just below)and both client and guide were seen moving
space blankets this morning through the telescope. Alive. But they could not
stand. One could not see. No comms. Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics and
you are sure to read about this.

Coordinating therescue from the Col, Russ then rousted all available bodies
and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days, Purba and
Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone, humping oxygen. The
American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up
their summit attempt (remember, they failed last week and also failed in '99
so this is a huge sacrifice) to make the rescue. It looked bleak this
morning but after some injections our teammates began to move, carried by
the strong Americans. As i type, they have been moving at a snail's pace and
the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselves.We hope our
sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an
absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue. Remember, that ridge is 14
inches across for stretches, dropping 10,000 feet on either side. When i
gazed down 2 nights ago, it was truly like staring out of the window of a
plane, so steep was the drop. The sherps are going to have to be supermen.

From the ridge and high camp, chris and asmus (they've been wasting there
for over 36 hours now) have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter descent
to ABC. They are sucking some themselves to ensure we don't have a
double-rescue. I'm feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help
with the rescue, assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive. Too high
for a helo on this side so we'll have to platoon them down asap. Other
members who summitted earlier are still up too high, too slow descending
from 'safe' camps, and i may help them down as well. So i will not be back
by mem day--we have to get these people down.

The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope, sulking
and making occasional trips to the waste moraine. The client was slower and
slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field. I thought: uh oh.
Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold
and the guide was pursuaded by the client. Soon russ was on the radio
screaming at the guide to drag the client down, but the hour grew late and
suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap, both men immobile
and nearly incoherent, the guide kicking and draggin the client, to no
avail. Asmus was with them and performed valiantly, as i mentioned, but no
one was in a position to help. At that height, every second counts and the
other teams rushed past on their way to safety. When you rush into a burning
building you can't linger, especially if your physical performance is
literally cut in half.

I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  it's hard to think f
anything else as they progress home, mumbling, step by step. I have messages
from their wives but they are unable to [process spoken language at this
point. Even if they get down, i wonder what the results will be. It's really
sad. I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--i'll explain the process
when i get home but siffice to say you literally can't boil water fast
enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude. My heartbeat at top camp
was 180 when i was 'resting' in my sleeping bag before the attempt. My
tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids
coming at a rate of a liter an hour, doing nothing.

I feel lucky today. Very lucky. When i think of my own descent, alone,
throwing up along the way yesterday, i realize just how razor-thin this
whole thing is. There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my
jumar on a supposedly new rope, ony to reach the anchor point to find a
ten-year-old knot, totally fried by the uv rays. Other times i stepped in
snow footprints and slipped, sliding down on my stomach until the rope
jerked taut. Too many ways to die here.The aussie who gave me his water in
the bowl may have prevented another casualty. Who's to say? Problem here is
that, unlike the events we're used to when we sprint to the finish line (we
used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the
finish), you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the
mountain. And it's so hard to do that. Is a quarter tank enough? Half? Or do
you need even more because, in truth, you are dying from the moment you
leave camp 3 (not even top camp).

I will pass this info only when the word is out--sorry--but will keep you
updated from there once i talk ro russ. It's hard watching friends die but
we're helpless down here.

I need all of the Foster applications on my local profile.  I have some of them on local and some of them on my terminal server profile.  I need the same Foster profile that Diana Scholtes has on her local machine.  As of this morning I still do not have it.  Please let me know when my profile gets updated.

Thank You,
Holden

Chip,

	The issue seems to be that of an Information Risk Management problem where they haven't pushed out all the application access to Holden's profile.. I had put in a ticket with (31411) under your name for this matter on Monday. I will call them and ask them to escalate this matter.

i'm sry..hunbun

You called me hun!

I exercised my options today...for various reasons.

First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5
today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i
really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.

Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were
selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to
enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron
Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was
released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India
deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably
going to move back down.

Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee
"consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see
many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and
the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly
dissapating.

Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price
levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy
money....I can always take the money market and get back in
enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but
the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few
thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite
uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.

OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if
that market continues to trend up.

So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever
written.
Talk to you later hun

I would wear nice slacks and a nice shirt...maybe like you would wear to a nice dinner if you didn't have to wear a jacket..that kind of thing.  I don't think a suit is necessary.  See you friday!

Hey You,

I will see you Friday.  Do you think I need a suit or
is this more casual?

what do you think about having another get together at our house on saturday.....we could barbeque or come up with something else.....it's so nice outside...i think we should take advantage of the weather.  let me know.

Thanks.  Give me a ring when you have a chance.  I baked both the cakes last night.  Love to tell you about it.
By the way...that is the best damn chocolate cake i have ever had...that was exactly what i was looking for.
Talk to you later.

2-12" cakes may work ok but you might swap the positions about half way
through the cooking time.I'm pretty sure it will take longer than the
prescribed time but it will work. To acurately test them,touch the top of
each layer.If the finger marks bounce back you're there.If they remain
indented.bake a little longer.Perhaps 2 minutes at a time.If you have any
pressing issues call my cell(713-725-2676) Good luck    Den

Made the ganache last night...tastes great...do you glaze it on the cake or frost the cake?  It said frosting..but to me it looked glazeable.
Ran to make a cake during lunch to pick up last few things.  What do you think about baking 2 12x2 cakes in one oven at the same time...staggering the pans?  I was wondering if it wouldn't bring down the oven temp because it might interfere with the air circulation in the oven.  Oh well...not sure what I'm going to do.

Their recipe is fine.Sometimes I get to feeling a little frisky and I use
others.Good luck and let me know if you get in a bind.    Den
Question:
For the engine cake do you use the recipe for the ganache on there or a
different one?
I was planning on trying their recipe.
Tonight i'm going to measure out everything.  I'll keep you updated.

Did you get a chance to try those recipes yet?How was Vegas?  We had a
pretty good time.Let me know how your doing.   Den

Count me in, but the dogs will probably have issues.  Talk to you later.

Todd is trying to reserve a large (sleeps 16 comfortably) cabin on Lake
Travis around the 4th of July holiday.  The 4th is on a Wednesday this year
so he'll probably reserve it through the proceeding or following weekend.
I'm just trying to get a head count for now so anyone interested please let
me know.

We rented this place a couple years ago and had a great time.  It's located
on the lake and has a private boat dock.  Todd will most likely have his
boat for skiing and cruising the lake.  Other activities include Jet Ski
rental, wind surfing rental, sun bathing, cooking out, and drinking.

John

I called and it's available. I'm going to send them an email this afternoon
and find out what the charges would be. I spoke to Bob's wife and she said
that it goes for $600 a night, but that for an extended stay he will usually
negotiate.

I guess the next thing we would need to find out is how many people would be
interested in staying at the house. Can you send Mark a note and let me know
how many of the folks in H-town would be interested and for what days?

Excellent....i will be in town that weekend.  You just name the time and place.
I was definitely mint-juleped...i love that.  I think those were the last days of disco for mo.
I plan to be very lame for the next few weeks..read a lot...spring cleaning, that kind of thing.
So hopefully i'll hear from you soon.  Take care,
Mo.

Joseph.F.Reid@accenture.com on 05/14/2001 12:22:55 PM
Hey,

Yes, I tried calling on Saturday night but you must have already been mint
juleped (if that is a verb...you tell me?)  I actually did not make it down
this weekend...forgot it was Mother's Day so I stayed here and did the
brunch thing with Mom and Grandma in Connecticut, will be coming down on
Memorial Day Weekend so maybe we can say hello then.

I'll try calling you this weekend anyway and we can swap our relationship
stories.  Glad you had a good time in Kentucky and you made it home safely.
Talk to you soon...promise.

joe

            Monique.Sanchez@enron.c
Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a
voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very
intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was
maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.
Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the
next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you
soon.
Take care,
Mo.

how does a tossed salad w/ tomatoes/mozzarella and balsalm vinegar sound....and then maybe some sort of something else...sauted breast of chick??

I will be busy baking the cake.  I am just crossing my fingers that the oven doesn't wig out on me mid cake..........you might have to sedate me if that happens.
We'll talk later.

Yes and no.
I think in many ways he is very similar to us.  This is the lifestyle he has always led since college.  To settle down and lay roots somewhere is something that I know from talking with him pulls at his conscience often, that he wants at many levels....but is unfamiliar and therefore scary for him to consider doing.  

Just like our desire to live that kind of lifestyle...seemingly free, having only enough money to get you to the next destination...is extinguished by our practicality about things like retirement...providing for a family...and having money to do things that require money to do like ski trips, alaska, etc.

I think this just goes to show how difficult it is to make major lifestyle changes that go against years of living and thinking differently.  Not just adapting to new creature comforts but changing one's mindset...which is scary...and difficult.  

More than you bargained for in a response eh? 
We are leaving here at 11ish..the flight leaves at 1pm.  I'll give you a call before we board the plane.
L-mo.

Go ahead, tell me this doesn't make you just a little jealous.

well,
for those of you that thought i was sticking around portland....uh, psyche!
just kidding...uh, whoops!

actually, portland was great.  i plan on returning there post-summer to
give it another go...hopefully with more money in the account for those
financial droughts.  unless of course a climbing trip to thailand happens
to come up!!!!!

as for now...stop sending all those letters to portland and just change the
address to minnesota.  as always, cookies and chocolate are always welcome.

here i shall reside with the bugs and anything else that'll try to crawl
into my sleeping bag.  i will be here from the 11th of may until the end of
august.  email is still prob'ly the best way to get a hold of me.  by the
time i get there, i'll have a new cell # so you can leave voice mails
anytime, otherwise you can usually leave messages on the office phone.

in case that itch to travel gets to you this summer and you find yourself
in the northwoods with no where to rest your weary head.....always know
that you can stop on by at a moments notice!

so until the next time, be well, smile plenty, and hug someone you  love.

off belay,

well,
for those of you that thought i was sticking around portland....uh, psyche!
just kidding...uh, whoops!
 
actually, portland was great.  i plan on returning there post-summer to give it another go...hopefully with more money in the account for those financial droughts.  unless of course a climbing trip to thailand happens to come up!!!!!
 
as for now...stop sending all those letters to portland and just change the address to minnesota.  as always, cookies and chocolate are always welcome.

Phillip,

Courtney needs me to watch the boys on Thursday in order to get organized before we leave for Italy.  I can be reached on my cell phone 713-408-6256.  Please have Anne update the newcurrentday sheet in order to manage my position.  Please call me with any pertinent market information.  I will see you Friday.  Thanks for the help.

Thanks,
Mike

Hey there, 
haven't done the recipes yet. I'm actually planning on doing just the chocolate one.  I am going to do another cake that is a white chiffon cake w/ white choc buttercream frosting.  It also has the buttercream/fresh berrries/ and seedless jam in the layers.  I'll let you know how that turns out.
My plan is to do the frostings/ganache on monday..and bake the cakes on tuesday...assemble wednesday.  I've been wiggin out about it because I am doing this to feed 30 people and I have not been practicing at all.......But....i slapped myself around yesterday to calm down and i'm ready for it.  I will do all the measuring on sunday too..so i think i'm giving myself enough time.  Wish me luck.
By the way...I loved Make A Cake..AND they have those expensive silicone molds on sale from 67 to 40 each....i bought a financier mold.  The guy is getting rid of them because they don't sell.  You may want to pass this on to Dan.
I'll let you know how it goes.  John is joking with me by asking "When are the cakes due?"....like it is homework.
Talk to you soon,
Mo.

Did you get a chance to try those recipes yet?How was Vegas?  We had a pretty good time.Let me know how your doing.    Den

Hey,

Yes, I tried calling on Saturday night but you must have already been mint
juleped (if that is a verb...you tell me?)  I actually did not make it down
this weekend...forgot it was Mother's Day so I stayed here and did the
brunch thing with Mom and Grandma in Connecticut, will be coming down on
Memorial Day Weekend so maybe we can say hello then.

I'll try calling you this weekend anyway and we can swap our relationship
stories.  Glad you had a good time in Kentucky and you made it home safely.
Talk to you soon...promise.

joe

Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a
voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very
intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was
maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.
Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the
next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you
soon.
Take care,
Mo.

We should talk soon and it actually won't be that long before I come into
town again.  I'll be down the weekend of May 12 that Thursday night and
nothing would make me happier than to spend a chunk of the afternoon at The
Ale House again.  A few beers always helps these kinds of conversations
because they are difficult emotional things to think about and that is best
done if you are willing to let your guard down.  I have been thinking a lot
about my relationship and what it means to me and I would love to share if
you are willing to listen.  You haven't slowed the traveling down at all I
see...all I claim in terms of travel are weekly trips to lovely suburban
New Jersey.  Enjoy the Derby (if it wasn't this past weekend and I'll talk
to you soon)

peace, love and flowers

Hey there,
I would love to have more deep conversations on these topics.  Maybe we can
schedule a long phone call sometime since i'm sure it will be a while
before you come in.  I am so bad about answering my phone in the
evenings...i just shut down shop when i go home....but we should definitely
talk.  I'm interested in hearing about you as well.  From our talk last
time it seems we may have some of the same dilemmas.  I've got a trip
coming up to the Kentucky derby next weekend...was in vegas last
weekend....but will be around here until mid june when john and I go to
alaska.  I am slightly ready to slow down now...way too much travel...john
and i need to spend more quality time together.  I don't know how you do
the long distance relationship..it would be very hard for me.  I guess I
crave more constant attention--high maintenance---Ha!  Kidding.  Anyway, it
is always great to hear from you.  Hopefully we can talk soon.
Take care,
Mo.

baking, food preparing, favorite Enron employee?  I promised i wasn't going
to let you go another 12 months before i talked to you again and i'm
keeping my word.  We have a lot still to talk about in line with the
conversation we had at the Ale House...you know, good times, good friends,
good beer and deep conversation about love, career, marriage and what we do
with our lives.  Respond when you can and I hope all is well with you.

Talk to you soon,

Here is a copy of the itinerary for all the clients staying at the Best
Western on Blenkenbaker Lane. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks!

 - BEST WESTERN ITINERARY.xls 

Mom,
I know you are really strapped to find people to take care of granny on the weekends and i know the costs are adding up as well.  But, if you find someone who can come on saturday or sundays for the day or even for a few hours on a weekly basis i can help pay for that expense.  With the weather improving,  I think it would be good for your stress to be able to get out in the morning and go to the park and just walk the memorial loop and be oustide.  Do you think Robin could come for a few hrs on sat or sunday mornings?  We could meet at the park, David could meet us as well.  I do have a few trips planned for the near future, but I would be very happy to meet you at the park to go walking or at Hanks when I am in town.  I would not be able to cope well with the stress of my job without the outlet of going to the gym or the park to work things out..  Let me know how I can help.

Went to the doctor this morning.  Was telling him about the mild chest pain
(over the left side) that have been coming on and lasting no more than 5
minutes. Told him I have been under a hugh amount of stress for quite a long
time and that I thought that could very well be the problem.  After giving
him the wonderful health history of both maternal/paternal side, he decided
to do an ECG and complete blood work.
	 ECG states an "abnormal ECG -- non-specific T wave abnormality".  I
will have to read about the T wave.  My blood pressure was 178.  Never
before that it ever been over 110/80.
	I am now waiting for referral approval for both a Stress Test at St.
Lukes and a bone density/mammogram at St. Joseph.
	I feel confident that everything is allright, but I thought just in
case I should keep both of you posted.

Just spoke with Rebecca...the guys wife.  She says he has a grandfather clock repair tonight to do....not sure if 7 will work.  I told her we had just wanted to check it out while it was still daylight outside.  She is going to phone her hubby and get back with me.  I also gave her your name and cell phone.  She said that this truck is her husbands "baby" and it is breaking his heart to get rid.  Thats a good sign.  I'll talk to you later.

Monique,

I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend but
with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun and
you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I think
you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value you
what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm very
good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what is
happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a strange
way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are available,
respond by email when you can

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

Hey there,
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.  Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.  
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to you soon,

where did you get the toast?

Toast with S-Jam for b-fast!  Yummy!

hey there,
wondering what you'd like to do tonight for dinner?
i know you probably need to do stuff like pack for germ.
i am supremely grouchy.  i will do my best to perk up for you when i get home.
i forgot shoes so i will not be joining sue at hanks.
my plan was to go home....start drinking...and do some desk work/sparebedroom work.
just shoot me a line when you get a chance...........latersky.
Mo.

I think i'm in for the following:
stop at store on way home...pick up buttermilk
get on couch for hr long nap
cook dinner...bacon and eggs..biscuits and jam.
we walk the dogs
we share laundry
i'll do dishes
bath
bed
start the day over manana w/ a run at memorial early.
Mo.

No need to perk up for me.  I should learn to live with you on days like
this.

Yes, I do need to pack/start laundry.  I'm flex for dinner.  Two
suggestions:

1. Eggs and bacon (me)/biscuits (you).  Dishes (me).  Walk with dogs (us).
2. Meet at home, slip into our running gear, grab the dogs, and go to
Memorial for a jog.  Stop on the way home and pick something up for dinner
(veggies with tofu).

new deals are: -14,784
curveshift was: 51,652

positions and curves are attached.  take care of yourself.  call anytime.

  

hey there,

i will probably not have the aol on in the mornings....too distracting....but i wanted to let you know that i will continue to send you an email everyday after curves until you let me know you have closed all your positions.  give me a ring if you need anything, or shoot me an email.   i'm sure you are also talking to janie.  
take care,
mo.

Thanks for the tickets.  We had a great time.  They were actually dead center of the covered area...perfect......and much better than the field considering the lightening storm and heavy downpour that lasted about an hr.   We even got sprayed by some bi-directional rain..it was wild.
Anyways, thanks again.
Mo.

hey there,

i am just anti-msgrs for a while.....just too much chit chat overload for me...not you...just everyone combined....i'm really a loner..ha ha
...anyways.....just letting you know...sure i'll log in later today.....i'll holler if i need to work anything.
mo.

tuttobene?
vincents? w/ grappa bar before?
latersky

I'm in, and as far as i'm concerned the more laid back of a place the better....i've been to a lot of stuffy restaurants as of late...but seriously i am flexible if we go stuffy.  just let me know when and where.

hi guys...i know that over the past few weeks i have been asking you guys if
you could come out to a prebon/ene dinner on next thursday may 31st at a
site t.b.d......the day is about a week away now and i hope that we can all
still hang out...i'm emailing you guys to see who is still in or if there
are any ":flakes" as the date grows closer...additionally...where would you
guys like to go?....any place new in houston that we need to check out ?
just let me know so i can make the plans and if i left anybody out who wants
to go ( sneal, griggs, martin, huntman, frank ) the more the better as far
as i'm concerned...thanks

donny 

hey there,

this just in....we may all have var limits now....lavo imposed a million dollar fine on our group bc we exceeded var...of course we just exceeded it by 130k....you can imagine our reaction and the discourse....i'll let you know what comes out of that.

so it looks like you did no trades today.
your curve shift is -218.
mike went out w/ fixed price phys today.  it looks like elpo has picked city gate to manipulate this month....they are lifting the fixed price like it is going out of style.  june basis at the cg ran.
the juan cash today was mostly given.....i think matt was able to cover stuff pretty quickly...and with no fluff...ha ha

i guess that is about it.  aga was 118...with 110 being our expectation.  the screen fell a bit as a result

we have prebid today.  hope you feel well.  talk to ya later.
attached are just the curves since your positions are unch.

later,
Mo 

I'm glad you remembered my email.  Glad to see you too.  Now that I have your email you are sure to get the invite for next years partyI actually ran into Anthony Magdaleno about 2 weeks ago.  Do you know him?  He was in the same volunteer group w/ Monica and I.
I think we are going to meet up at woodrows again this friday.  I like the location....and some different faces as well as opposed to the kirby crowd.
I work on the west gas trading desk here at enron....if you have friends who work in gas as well, perhaps i know them.  Of course this place is like A&M....huge.  Take care and hopefully we'll see each other out again. Say hello to Monica for me.  Maybe we can meet up sometime after work for drinks.

Monique

i'm glad we ran into each other at woodrow's on friday.  hope you had fun.
i had a blast.

a lot of my friends work at enron now, maybe we know more people in common.

have a great day!  maybe i'll hear from you soon....

rosie

Monique,

Why don't we meet at the Ale House at 3:30 and share a beer or 2?  Can you
do that??

Hey there,
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry
jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.
Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to
you soon,
Mo.

   Monique,

   I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend
   but
   with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
   in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
   most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun
   and
   you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I
   think
   you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value
   you
   what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm
   very
   good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what
   is
   happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
   going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
   hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

   You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a
   strange
   way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
   troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
   through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
   time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are
   available,
   respond by email when you can

   Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

Hey there,
I don't have David's new email address.  I wanted to see if you all wanted to get together on the house on sunday.  We could grill something outside if you all want.  I'm not sure if David and Terry have other plans.  I would like to bring over a cake.  Let me know what works.

This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

hey there,

curve shift: 56,497

  
not much going on...we are all listening to that conference....my ears are hurting ..i think it has given me a headache.  
i'll talk to you manana.
Mo

I am determined to get you to smile at least 5 times today....I think I've seen one so far.

just curious...are you leaving on friday or sat.

I can see this will be difficult.  I will also settle for 5 dirty looks or physical assaults.

I am determined to get you to smile at least 5 times today....I think I've seen one so far.

Melba,

Mike is interested in putting out some of our west eol products on a 24 basis, similar to the nymex desk.  However, we would like more information on how this would work and  what kinds of controls are available for products to shut off automatically.  If you have time today, perhaps you could swing by our desk and give us more information.  Sometime in the afternoon would be great for us.
Let me know.
Thanks,
Monique

Hey there,

I have a broker dinner on thurs.  These things can drag out...so I'm not sure I'll be able to stop by.
Best of luck in school.  I enjoyed hanging out with you the short time we knew each other.  Forward me your new email address when you get one.  I'll write you if I take the plunge and reverse the long trading/short cooking spread.  Who knows.
Take care,

Mo

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!

Brian

I was very worried last night.  David's note made it seem like something had happened.  I didn't know my phone was out.  I hardly use it...i'm really not a phone person.  But when I realized it was out yesterday...cingular was closed and i couldn't call.  John is getting in today.  I am doing a fun run tomorrow morning and we will be in the rest of the weekend.  I should get the phone taken care of later this afternoon.  This evening I have another broker dinner.  I will try to call before I got to that.   Talk to you later.

I called you Wednesday night and got the message that your phone was
disconnected.  When I got the same message on Thursday, I got worried.  I
called John's phone and left a message.  Hope you get reconnected soon.
David and I are thinking of going to Ft. Sam tomorrow morning.  Need to buy
some things on post.  Will talk to you this evening.

Love you much,
Mom

Yo!
Yes, I believe your typical campells will have little mushroom pieces in it.  And kmart would be a good place to buy a pyrex dish (glass baking)....of course you could borrow any supplies from me any time.  Are you cooking up some grub for a lil lady???
I heard you all had a great time.  Saw the pic of you that john said you "woke up" for at the brewery.  Maybe we all can get together for a brew before john and i are off for alaska on sunday.  we will be gone for a week and a half.  Maybe friday after work.
Let me know if you have any other cooking q's.
Mo

Hey Momar.  Did you have a peaceful  week?  We had a blast.  I've got a couple of Q's for ya.  Does  cream of mushroom soup have actual mushroom pieces in it?  And where would  be a good place to buy a glass baking/casserole dish?
 
Thanks,
Robbie

Hey there,

Hey Mo.  I got the final email on my positions and it looks like I bought a tiny bit too much Q3 san juan at -74 on my last click.  Would you mind just transferring the scraps back into your book?  I think it's literally about 250/mm a day -- you can see it on tds.  Thanks again.

Ha.  I will definitely not be on that list.  Lets just say 32:30.  I was just focused on not puking when I crossed the finish so all I could make out was a big 32 on the clock. Thanks.

An estimate works fine for the ERC.  As far as I know the site that usually posts results, www.runnertriathletenews.com only posted the top 3 spots in each age group.

jeese, we don't have to leave this place just bc my trading profits are in a death spiral.  i can always stay here and bake cakes at the omni till you are ready to leave.  and then of course we have to consult the dogs and see what their schedule looks like.  ugh---this day is so bad.  i feel so helpless it just sucks.   i will give you a call when i head out to the hpy hr...did you get my message about AK?
talk to you later.
M

I got back form Germany on Friday and have been trying to catch up with work
before our trip to Alaska.  We leave this Sunday the 10th.  Monique's
brother is going to watch the dogs while we're gone so don't worry about it.
It sounds like you've got your hands full.

It's great you're buying a house.  We just can't seem to figure out what we
want to do.  Monique is so stressed out with work right now I'm not sure how
much longer we'll be in Houston.

Did you get a good loan?  Did you get your truck yet?

Hi Worm,

How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!
What are the dates you are going to Alaska?
Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?
Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!
I have two offers on the table right now.
Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one
I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,
I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.
How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?
Let me know.
Love,
Jul

Hey there,
I am actually off to Alaska on sunday with john and am gone until the 20th...so maybe you can call me before then.  Take care,
Mo

Monique,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we could've
gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days and
then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to
catch up on and I am going to be tenacious in my attempts to get a hold of
you...let me know when you have time to talk.  I am out this weekend but
maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.

Take care and stay safe.

Bear Destroyed after Fatal Attack in Canada 
Compiled by Outside Online
June 6, 2001 A black bear that attacked and killed a camper in Canada's Northwest Territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports. 

Coroners determined that the bear shot yesterday was the same animal that mauled 18-year-old Kyle Harry on Saturday while he was camping with friends near Yellowknife. The bear had been shot by a RCMP officer at the scene of the attack on Saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear's chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer, a wildlife official told the London Free Press. 

Harry and five other teens had camped overnight on Friday before four members of the group left early on Saturday morning, the London Free Press reports. Harry and a 14-year-old girl stayed behind and saw the bear come into their campground around noon. They pulled their food inside of their tent then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent. The girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car. Harry, caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge, was found dead by officials. A report yesterday by The Outdoor Network says the bear was feeding on Harry when officials arrived. 

On Sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal, employing a helicopter and infrared scanner. Another bear shot on Monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack. 

On July 2 of last year, 24-year-old Canadian biathlete Mary-Beth Miller was killed by a black bear while on a training run at the Myriam Bedard Biathlon Centre near Quebec City.

Hey there,

Mom, can you forward this on to David.

I am going to forward you our flight itenary from home this weekend.  We leave at 9:30am on sunday.  We are going to go into Columbus sat morning and then will stop by David's on Saturday to prep the yard and set up any necessary stuff for the dogs.  We will drop the dogs off though on Sunday morning very early.  I don't want to leave them there overnight for the first night by themselves...though usually they are fine to stay by themselves...I just want to make sure that the yard will be secure.  

The company we are going with is called Alaska Discovery.  Their website is www.akdiscovery.com  .  We will be staying at their inn on the days prior and after our actual expedition.  The trip we are doing is called the Glacier Bay Expedition....trip start date being the 11th.  On the 19th we fly back to seattle and will have to stay there overnight.  Our return flight to Houston is wed the 20th at 6ish in the morning and we will both be coming into work when we get in.  We will pick up the dogs that evening.

I am going to leave David my cell phone bc the tags on the dogs have that phone number on it.  To get into the voice mail just dial the phone number  713-516-0651 ....and the password is 1743.  The dogs eat together and share 1 1/2 coffee cans full of dog food once a day.  They eat in the evening.  Pearl takes medication twice a day and one of them is supposed to be taken with food.  We usually just give her a few treats in the am with the pill.  We will leave treats along with the food.  

I think that is about it.  Thanks again for taking care of the dogs.  We really appreciate it.  I will call before and after we are in the woods to check up on things and we will pick them up wednesday evening.

Talk to you later.  Mom, John and I will come by before we leave.  Probably Saturday evening.

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

ok Mr. Big. Sounds like Jimmy Nelson in college complex has hit you late
in life.

I'm back in Houstonon June 7, 2000. Let me know.

If PG&E's LOCs are related to the now cancelled long term power trades, they 
clearly should not be renewed. What are the SCE LOCs for?

	William S Bradford/ENRON@enronXgate
	04/17/2001 10:46 AM
		 
Thanks.

What about Pacific Gas & Electric Company and Southern California Edison 
Company?

Bill

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

Let's discuss.

Bill

The following LC's expire on 4/30/01.  Due to the issues in the West, please 
advise if we need to amend the expiry date.

Why don't I start sending you a brief e-mail every Friday summarizing
activities in the case for that week and what is coming up soon.  Nothing
fancy or time consuming, just a brief update

For example:

Today:

          (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have to
disclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 1998, even about
March 1998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice of
counsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred ruling
whether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 1998
concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.  (I want to find out
what this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)

          (2)  Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort by
Natwest to postpone the trial in California until September.  I don't think
Natwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.  I am not
planning for  ECT Securities to take a position.

          (3)  We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath's report, after
removing a big section discussing Hellmold's report in light of Tom Hatch's
statement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECT
Securities.

Later this week:

        Hellmold's deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY.
 I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say, or not
say, about ECT Securities.

Do you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about Ponti Singh's depo (and
also her remark on the street to Brian that McDonald is going to blame Enron
for something concerning related party transactions?

Joe Eisenberg just floated a trial balloon with me.  Joe is at risk of losing 
the CFO and counsel, something I reported yesterday.  On top of that, the 
creditors committee is balking at spending a part of the approximately $20 
million of "unencumbered" cash to keep the doors open and generate numbers 
that only benefit participants.  Joe is thinking about a liquidating plan.  
He didn't have all the details, but he did mention several points.  Some 
amount would be set aside to pay the trade debt.  He used a $5 million 
number.  The total unsecured debt (not including participants' claims) could 
be as much as $20 million if rejection damages are included, so those 
creditors would stand to get around 25%.  The balance of the cash, after 
paying administrative costs, would go, directly or indirectly, for the 
benefit of participants.  The litigation and claims resolution would be under 
the control of the participants.  Some of the cash would pay for accounting 
work.  Other cash would pay for prosecution of litigation claims under the 
direction of a committee.  In the end, whatever cash remains together with 
any recoveries from litigation, would presumably be distributed to 
participants.  I assume the plan would designate some individual to supervise 
the wind up process.  The participants committee could remain in existence to 
supervise the process.  If we structured such a plan, we'd try to push it to 
confirmation quickly, assuming support from the creditors committee.  The 
option may be appointment of a trustee.  We should discuss our preference so 
that I can get back to Eisenberg promptly.

Richard and Andy,
I am forwarding this for your information. Is this a case which you are aware 
of? I understand that Bracewell is representing Ecogas.
    Bob Vote

Here is the information with respect to insurance coverage.  Please forward 
this to Richard Sanders.

- -EWK
Correct...the comments below, both with respect to defense and indemnity, 
apply to Enron Corp. and Mr. Maffett.

Thanks,

Rob

According to the petition, Mr. Maffett is an Enron person.  Please confirm 
that you are extending cover to Enron and employees.

- - EWK
Have received and reviewed the Plaintiff's First Amended Petition relative to 
the above.  Please note this matter is subject to Gulf Company's insurance, 
subject to the following reservation of rights, given the allegation of  
"personal injury" which is defined in part as:

Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or 
organization or disparages a person's or organizations goods, products or 
services.

As such, we would have an obligation to defend the entire lawsuit, even the 
allegations associated with "breach of contract".   Our obligation to defend 
this matter in its entirety would cease in the event the covered count of 
slander and defamation were to be dismissed.

With respect to indemnity, we will only respond to an award for damages which 
(1) flows from the allegation of slander and defamation, and (2) which were 
not made with knowledge that they were false.

Our obligation to pay defense costs begins today.  Please advise if counsel 
has already been retained given what has been submitted for review is the 
Plaintiff's First Amended Petition.  If counsel has already been retained, 
then they will need to be issued our standard Engagement Agreement, and 
should be instructed to begin a new billing cycle today.  Please see that 
they provide you with a copy of their entire file.

Please call in the event you have any questions.  I trust you will share this 
email with the appropriate operating company, and counsel for Mr. Randall 
Maffett so they are aware of same.

Harry---Please find out exactly what they are filing---get a copy of it if 
possible and lets set up a conference call to discuss.

Richard - please let us know if it makes sense for us to file anything in 
connection with this motion.  (I would think probably not.)  Also, any luck 
in getting the PX to set forth its position regarding release of collateral 
in writing?

SDG&E is planning to file a motion in Judge Moreno's court requesting an
Order vacating (as moot) paragraph 6 of the Preliminary Injunction (which
permits participants to withhold amounts previously paid in charge-backs

Please see attached letter sent out Friday, May 26, 2000.  

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a conf. call on this for 
Friday. Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard 
today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that 
they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to challenge 
our setoffs. Any news?

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the process 
of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular has Enron 
completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the 
Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to 
hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file 
something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the 
possibility is out there.

SDG&E is planning to file a motion in Judge Moreno's court requesting an
Order vacating (as moot) paragraph 6 of the Preliminary Injunction (which
permits participants to withhold amounts previously paid in charge-backs
from payments owing to the PX in connection with the normal invoicing
process) and stating that SDG&E is entitled to the amounts it has withheld
pursuant to paragraph 6.  SDG&E will argue that FERC clearly ordered the
charge-backs to be rescinded, and accordingly, that the reason for the

I have been asked to verify my understanding of Milbank's relationship with 
Enron for a group of Pacific Gas creditors with whom TN has been in 
discussions.? I sent them the following this afternoon:

I spoke with Paul Aronzon, the lead Milbank Tweed partner on the creditors 
committee engagement.? Aronzon said that Milbank Tweed does not represent 
Enron as general counsel or in any other significant capacity.? Enron uses 
Texas counsel when needed, but mostly relies on its very large inhouse legal 
staff.? Milbank Tweed has a large energy practice and works on transactions 
with Enron as lenders counsel, as counsel to entities in which Enron owns an 
equity interest and as outside counsel on isolated bankruptcy matters with 
Enron's in-house legal staff.? Aronzon said that if anyone has further 
questions regarding Milbank Tweed's relationship with Enron they can contact 
him directly (213-892-4377) or Lisa Mellencamp, Enron's general counsel (I 
believe that she can be reached at 713-853-3820).? Milbank Tweed will also be 
filing an application with the court, in connection with its representation 
of the unsecured creditors committee, which will list all potential 
conflicts.? This should be available on the court's web page - -?

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

I thought there was a pre-meeting at 9:00 am?

I did not participate in the call last week because I thought it was only 
concerning financial consultants. Shortly before the meeting,a more detailed 
agenda arrived by e-mail(which may be par for the course but I find 
irritating). Please find out 1) what was decided and 2) what is the agenda 
for tues. Thanks

The Committee interviewed financial advisors yesterday.  The list included 
PriceWaterhouse, KPMG, BDO, Stonefield Josephson and Neilson, Elggren.  The 
preference seemed to be PW, in major part because it was actively involved in 
creation of the Power Exchange systems.  There was an obvious concern about 
the potential for conflicts given PW's role for the PGE committee.  In that 
regard, we were told (1) that there is a different standard for accountants 
than attorneys, (2) that counsel for the PGE committee didn't perceive a 
problem, (3) that there would be different teams handling each of the cases, 
(4) that it was highly unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the 
underlying numbers (ie, that PW would at the same time be supporting and 
challenging numbers in claims litigation).  We've asked PW for assurances 
that if there is any challenge, it will be available to support the 
participants' position.  We're waiting for a response.  For the moment, no 
second choice has been identified.
Before the interviews, I spoke with Marc Cohen.  He's frustrated with Joe 
Eisenberg.  Joe has been slow in generating a stipulation to transfer 
litigation responsibility to the participants committee.  Consequently, Cohen 
went ahead and drafted a stipulation himself.  Evidently Eisenberg is about 
to sign off, and the matter will be presented to the court presumably on 
shortened time.  I took the opportunity to urge Cohen to press Eisenberg to 
prepare a liquidating plan.  In that regard, Eisenberg did go to the 
creditors committee and propose using $4 million of the $20 million of 
available cash to support a plan.  Not surprisingly, the creditors came back 
asking for $18 million.  Cohen's sense is that there may be a deal in the $10 
million range, particularly if we can persuade the trade that the 
participants may themselves have a claim against the $20 million.  Cohen is 
giving thought to how we make that case.  If we can agree on a number, we can 
get rid of the trade creditors, shift responsibility for the wind up to a 
liquidating agent of our choosing and close the bankruptcy case.
Cohen apparently has made no headway in efforts to reconstitute the PGE 
committee.  He's concerned that the second largest creditor does not have a 
seat at the table and questions whether the presence of such entities as 
Enron and Dynegy adequately represents the interests of the broad range of 
Power Exchange participants.  Wearing our CPX committee hat and the duty that 
comes with that, are we comfortable leaving things as they are rather than 
encouraging our counsel to pursue the matter with some formal motion in the 
PGE case?  Unless I hear to the contrary, I'll assume that our position in 
that regard has not changed and that if there were a committee vote on that 
particular issue, we'd abstain.
I see that some efforts may be underway to compel the Power Exchange to 
release collateral.  Is that something we'd consider joining?  Bob Nelson

I figure that the draft engagement letter between Enron and AGSK got pretty
far down in your piles these last several weeks, so I am taking the liberty of
attaching the current draft to this e-mail.  This matter is sufficiently
significant that we really should have a memorialization of the terms of our

used to cover the audit reports by one or both of the privileges.  Im also 
curious as to whether the same approach has been used with respect financial 
audits regarding internal controls.  Pls let me know.

Perhaps this will become the new outlet for Bernie's pro bono talents.  But
with him you never know.  The negative view would be:  he is still
litigating his 1986 divorce decree 15 years later, so why do we think he
will leave us alone now or next decade?  The only thing I am looking forward

McCUTCHEN, DOYLE, BROWN & ENERSEN, LLP

http://www.mccutchen.com

Attached for your comments is a revised complaint in inverse condemnation, 
with the PX and Reliant as plaintiffs.? I am sending it separately to Susan 
Rossi, in-house counsel for the PX.? Since our last conference call we've 
discussed the various forums and pending actions with FERC counsel for 
Reliant and Enron. My understanding is that the PX wants us to act and will 
cooperate with us.? 

Marc, I haven't circulated this to the whole group because I wanted to go 
through you.? What is the appropriate next step?? A call with the 
decisionmakers on this issue so that we can make a plan to move forward?? Can 
we do that Monday or Tuesday?

I've set out Reliant's conclusions here.? 

1. There is no forum other than California state court in which we can get 
compensation for the commandeered contracts because of the Eleventh Amendment 
issue.

2. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with the FERC 
proceeding in Tucson Electric. 

3. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with Duke v. 
Davis or with any other proceeding anyone may want to bring alleging that the 
commandeering itself was illegal (e.g. on preemption grounds).

4.? As we discussed, nobody (including PG&E and SCE) wants the Board of 
Control to be deciding anything if we can avoid it.? We would suggest going 
along with the PX's suggestion that the bankruptcy court should be staying 
the Board of Control action because of the interventions of SCE and PG&E, who 
are taking the position that the compensation should go to them.? Then, we 
can go forward with the inverse condemnation action in state court (we picked 
LA as the forum because LA residents are less affected by the energy crisis 
than most others in the state, and because it's convenient). If PG&E and SCE 
are permitted to intervene in the state court action, we can stipulate to 
relief from stay so that it can go forward.? This way, the Board of Control 
is effectively stayed while the state court action goes forward.

5.? Richard Sanders expressed the very real concern that we don't want SCE 
and PG&E's defenses to liquidation of the block forward contracts to be 
decided anywhere but FERC.? We think we should be able to avoid that: since 
SCE and PG&E have already put the issue squarely before FERC, that defense 
could be stayed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine pending FERC's 
decision.? We would argue that the whole case need not be stayed in the 
meantime, since the governor's duty to compensate holds no matter who is owed 
the compensation, and any proceeds from PX contracts will be funneled into 
the Moreno escrow account.

6.? As we also discussed, we can file this complaint in the name of the PX, 
Reliant, and any other market participants who want to be plaintiffs (we just 
need names and a few facts to allege for each plaintiff). Or, as someone 
suggested, if the PX Market Participants Committee is an entity that has 
standing, it could be filed in that name along with the PX.? Either way, the 
prayer for relief asks that all funds be deposited in the Moreno escrow 
account for disposition consistent with FERC's decision in Coral Power.

Howard-- I strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the 
Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation. When we originally hired 
Greenberg, we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30 
minutes--5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience.. Some in the 
group thought that they were the right choice over, for example, Andrews & 
Kurth, because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at 
the courthouse than at FERC. I clearly think we made the right call in this 
regard. However at the time we made the choice, I made the comment, which I 
am sure all of you remember, that if we were going to choose litigation 
counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job. If 
that happened to be Greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview 
like the rest. The fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get 
the job. That research is transferable.This is a billion dollar issue for the 
group. Enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are 
absolutely sure they are the best there is. I have talked to the attys for 
both Mirant and Reliant and they agree with my position. I think we need to 
talk about this at length.

	04/26/2001 09:47 PM
		 
Brian:

With respect to your first point, I will instruct Greenberg Glusker to
modify the footnote regarding McCutcheon Doyle to indicate that the
Committee "will consider supporting" an application under section 503(b).
While the Committee has not yet considered the question, as you point out,
nevertheless we anticipate that McCutcheon Doyle's assistance will be very
helpful in the prosecution of the commandeering litigation.  If that proves
to be true, as I suspect it will, the Committee should not hesitate to
support a section 503(b) application on McCutheon Doyle's behalf at the
appropriate time.

With respect to your second point, one of the primary reasons discussed for
the Committee's decision to hire the Greenberg Glusker firm was the strength
of its litigation group, its experience with "inverse condemnation cases"
and the need to move quickly to control the commandeering litigation.  The
Committee did discuss its concerns regarding the attorneys retained by the
Debtor to handle the commandeering litigation but I do not recall any
reservations or qualifications concerning Greenberg Glusker's prosecution of
the commandeering matter.  During our Committee meetings, Greenberg Glusker
has already reported to the Committee the substantial time and effort it is
devoting to the commandeering matter, along with the McCutcheon firm.  Of
course, it goes without saying in any employment application that the
Committee always reserves its right to change counsel or hire special
counsel when appropriate.  Accordingly, I see no reason to make any changes
to the Greenberg Glusker employment application to address this point.

Please let me know right away if you disagree.  By copy of this email to the
other Committee members, I ask that they also let me know right away if they
disagree.

Thanks for responding quickly.

Howard:

I don't believe the Committee has agreed to recommend that McCutcheon Doyle
be compensated for its "commandeering" litigation support.  I'm not saying
the Committee wouldn't, but we have not taken formal action.

Moreover, the Committee has yet to determine who should prosecute the
"commandeering" claims once the Committee acquires control over them.  Prior
to Greenberg, Glusker's engagement, the Committee determined to reserve for
a later date whether special counsel should be retained.  I believe the
Committee would like to hear from Greenberg, Glusker again a description of
the firm's qualifications in this regard as well as interview other firms
which may be qualified to take on the task.

Thanks. Frankly, at this point, it is anyone's guess how this will develop. 
Given your distance to Spokane, Is there a local counsel that you would 
recommend---one with good ties to Jugde Whaley.

Maybe it goes without saying, but to dispel any doubt:  if the class action
suit that we discussed yesterday remains in front of Judge Whaley, and if he
handles the case out of Spokane, and if you decide that it makes sense to
retain co-counsel from Washington (a lot of if's, I know), I hope you will
consider our firm, and more specifically our office here in Seattle.  I have
defended numerous class action suits over the years, including, on behalf of
Northwest Airlines, a claim of price-fixing among major air carriers in the
setting of travel agent commissions.  As I mentioned, I also have some
knowledge about the roots and consequences of the current power crisis on
the West Coast, and I have some experience with Judge Whaley as well.  A
detailed personal resume along with a list of recent cases I have handled is
available on the firm's website (www.susmangodfrey.com).

Whether it ultimately makes sense for Enron to retain us in this case or
not, don't hesitate to call again if there is any other way I can be
helpful.

14  LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

   Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items 
of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron 
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate 
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such 
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse 
impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

   Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in 
Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company 
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and
Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or 
royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of 
which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into 
two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first 
matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and 
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the "Panhandle program," a 
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was 
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In 
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated 
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing 
to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain 
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with 
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court 
ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded 
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' 
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute 
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and 
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no 
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these 
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or 
results of operations.

   On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto 
Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in 
fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding 
property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, 
operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not 
provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and 
their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third 
parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer
Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, 
Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed 
in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court 
of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, 
business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  
After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all 
parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these 
suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was 
injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages 
attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for 
settlements or
final awards. Numerous claims have been settled. Although no assurances can 
be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of 
operations.

   Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial 
operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.  The OPUC granted 
PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent 
of its remaining investment in Trojan.

   The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to 
litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of 
Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to 
the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens 
Utility Board (CUB).

   In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with CUB and the staff of the 
OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in 
the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, CUB agreed to withdraw from the 
litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan 
litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the 
settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE's 
investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, 
either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of 
ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement 
agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With CUB's withdrawal, URP 
is
the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation. URP has 
indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE 
recovery of its investment in Trojan.

   Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances 
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results 
of operations.

   Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and 
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require 
expenditures in connection with the
construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for 
remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air 
Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These 
increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on 
Enron's financial position or results of operations.

   Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater 
remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur 
material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

Looks fine.

 Richard,

 Some time ago, you and I recommended to John Nowland, and he agreed, that we 
didn't have a case against the ship or the supplier of this product ("Elang 
Crude, fit for export"), but that we would try for a quick settlement with 
the cargo underwriter.  Attached is a draft of the proposed letter to the 
cargo underwriters.  David Best, Matt Lee, and I have reviewed and approved 
it and recommend it to you.  The red-lining will of course be cleaned up.  It 
will either be signed by Jim Studdert of our insurance group, or sent by him 
with a transmittal letter signed by him.

 Please let me know whether the letter is acceptable to you.  Thanks.

 Britt

Britt -

I have now identified the e-mail and attachment to which you referred in
your message on Friday.  For some reason it is not on my system but I now
have the hard copy from the file.  The covering message was very brief:

     "I attach an amended draft with the amendments highlighted in black."

I attach the draft hereto and apologise for the delay.

With best regards,
Helen Godel.

Richard,

     The only significant deposition this week is taking place in Minneapolis.
 The deponent is Arthur Cobb, a disclosure/due diligence expert retained by
Robins, Kaplan in several cases in which Enron is not named.  Mr. Cobb's
report did not mention ECT Securities, and the California plaintiffs did not
designate him to testify in the CA cases, so we decided not to attend his
deposition.  We are getting daily transcripts by e-mail.

     Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation and
damage issues is being deposed in San Francisco.  Roland has a scheduling
conflict, so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt.  The subject on which we want to
ask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after the
initial offering.  This is a very discrete area, easy to understand, and
Jonathan is on top of it.

     I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath.  Gerry
worked very hard on his report, putting in about 50% more hours than he
thought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report.  He is
very focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in 30
days.  I think Gerry did quite a good job, and we definitely need his best
effort going forward.  I would urge Enron to pay Gerry's bill very promptly.

     Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers to
interrogatories from us.  It is much ado about nothing.  We just want to deal
with it in the least expensive way.

     Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country, including
in CA, seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employee
conversations.  My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff,
and Natwest is trying to limit their losses.

     We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing. 
It is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law. 
The problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision (pro
rata, not relative fault) in the state securities statutes and a common law
doctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault.
 The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action against
ECT Securities, but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligent
misrepresentation causes of action.  How all of this works together is
virtually uncharted.

     With reference to your question about procedures at trial, none of the
defendants has cross-complained against the other defendants for a
determination of relative fault in the pending case; and, on the basis of the
current pleadings, no such determination will be made at trial.  If Enron goes
to trial and loses, along with others, theoretically the plaintiffs could
collect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the other
defendants, post-trial, for their respective shares of the liability, whether
such shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault.  We are working on a
memorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you.  I think you will
find that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle (assuming that we can
get the price low enough.)

Richard-

I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
you.

Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's
Lagrave Field.

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Williams, Reliant, Enron, Duke, AES, Dynegy, Mirant and Sempra have been
invited to a meeting with the Governor.  The press release provides: "The
agenda will include "unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power."
Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor
(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s)).
We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues to
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or
as evidence in any of the pending cases.  Are any of your clients also
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?
Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call
(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and consider
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant
should attend with its own counsel.  Please let me have your thoughts and
whether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available to
participate in a conference call.  Thanks/

Hi John.  I wanted to get you (and Richard Sanders) thinking about a request 
we have received from Owen Orndorff (who, for Richard's benefit, is one of 
the principals in Rosebud Energy Corp., the general partner of Colstrip 
Energy Limited Partnership ("CELP"), in which Enron, now through the "Condor" 
vehicle, holds a 25% limited partner interest;  CELP owns a waste 
coal-burning QF in Montana).

Rosebud has expressed an interest in filing suit against Montana Power 
Company ("MPC"), the facility's offtake purchaser, for MPC's refusal to allow 
CELP to remarket power above the minimum contract demand under the facility's 
PPA.  I will fax to you and to Richard a memorandum that the Doney, Crowley 
firm, which traditionally has done some work for CELP, has prepared regarding 
litigation theories and chances of success.  Owen has preliminarily scheduled 
a partnership meeting to discuss this issue (among others, as yet identified) 
on April 25th in Chicago.

My preliminary reactions to the Doney memo are that, at the time it was 
written, at least, there were a number of issues that had not been fully 
enough  researched for the partners to be making a decision.  I will ask 
Terry Donovan if further work has been done by now.  My initial reactions are 
that (1) having the PPA be the subject of a pending lawsuit could make our 
current efforts to sell our interest much more difficult;  (2) the potential 
is there for MPC to cook up some kind of counterclaim, which, even if not 
successful, puts additional pressure on the PPA, could draw out the 
litigation, and add costs, not to mention problems for our sale, and (3) the 
effort could result in as yet unknown costs to the partners (since, as I 
recall uner the partnership agreement, the costs would be borne by the 
partners - ??).  I also need to check and see just who within Enron is 
supposed to call the shots on the strategy for this, given that the 
investment is now held in Condor.

I will be out of the country on vacation beginning late Friday, April 6th, 
until Monday, April 23.  I'd like to touch base with you before I leave, 
since there won't be much time to develop our response to Owen prior to the 
meeting on the 25th.  At that time, we can also talk about what might come up 
on the sale effort while I'm out (at this point, there shouldn't be much, as 
Terry seems immersed on another deal).

I'll be in SF all this week trying to close on Pastoria, but am reachable at 
the office there (415/782-7800) or by pager (800/316-0430).  Thanks.

Michelle & Richard:
 I wanted to be sure that each of you were aware we have been given written
instructions from Enron accounts payable operations to send all legal bills
to a Houston P.O. Box, and not to any other address.
 In the past we have talked from time to time about each of your preferences
for sending our  legal bills. We will follow the instructions we have
received, but I wanted to be sure that each of you knew about this, and if
you still want copies of the bills sent to you for your information, just
let us know.
 Best regards,

 Bill

You know Mark Haedicke well. The meeting on the 9th has been cancelled in 
favor of the Thurs call.

Richard:  when Carl and I were down in HN a few weeks ago and met with you 
and Mark, Mark had suggested a meeting on May 9th in HN to discuss all of the 
status of all of the litigation matters and to coordinate with the various 
filings being made and anticipated to be made in the bankruptcy court by EPMI 
in the PG&E case and in the PX case (or through the Creditors or Participants 
Committees).  Do you know if that meeting in HN is still on or has that 
meeting in person been "overtaken" by the Thursday afternoon litigation 
update calls?  Thanks  John

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

Twanda Sweet will coordinate with you to get the dial in number..

Michelle Blaine has requested a flat screen for her computer.  Please let me 
know if I can move forward with fulfilling this request.  Thanks!

Stephanie:

Go ahead and order the computer battery for Gail Brownfeld.

You  need to get approval from Richard Sanders by e-mail so you will have a 
record he approved it (because he is the cost center owner) before you order 
the flat panel for Michelle Blaine.  Please note, the standard flat panel for 
our department is a 15" panel, definitely not an 18".    When Richard 
approves it you can go ahead and order the flat panel through iBuyit.  

The usual procedure for our department is the cost center owner needs to 
approve any requests for computer equipment before they are purchased.

Thanks.  I hope you are doing well.

As you might recall, I have been given the lead on the volumetric production

particular.

As you know, I have heard the long story from EOG.   You suggested that the
next time I was in Houston that we try to meet with Julia Heintz Murray to
get the more to point version from the ECT / Enron perspective.

I will be in town next week for the "measurement summit."  I could come
earlier, stay later, or carve out some time during to talk to Julia.  This
might be a good introduction for Andy as well.  (Of course, Barrett is also
included if his schedule permits.)

Tuesday afternoon, or Friday morning, in approximate order of preference.

you want me to come?
Richard,

Wanted to drop a line to see if you had any word/guidance on the 
termination/dispute language.  Can you call me early next week?

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a meeting w/ you, Jeff 
Dasovich, Jim Steffes, Mike Kirby and Robin Gibbs for Monday or Tues. 
regarding the strategy to deal with Sen. Dunn. Should we include anyone else?

need to talk to you about Dunn's hearing in Irvine next week....it will be on 
may 18th...Loretta Lynch will be testifying as will Bob Pease, legal director 
of FERC..because this is an offsite hearing, I don't know if they will be 
taping it..they will have a court reporter...I will attend, but I didn't know 
if you wanted to send an attorney.

Is it too late to take credit for this?

FYI, following-up on this matter, after discussing the matter with their 
counsel and confronted with a $3.5MM lawsuit, Lakeside acknowledged the deal 
and executed our paper.  Regards, Peter.

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year 
fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM 
(US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by 
that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of 
Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was 
subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that 
basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on 
guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put 
in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the 
guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique 
who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good 
understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  
Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is 
currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good 
understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than 
Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired 
last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.

Is it too late to help you on your antitrust question? I am around all week.

Just a quick note to say thanks for hooking up with my brother Steve. He is a 
pretty talented guy and I hope he can help you out.

Attached is an updated EWS Litigation Status Report.

Can you forward me some information regarding the French firm we discussed 
last week?

I asked my asst to set up a meeting w/ you( it has been set up for the 22nd). 
I am trying to get a better handle on the Neg CTC's--how they are 
earned/accrue. She should have set it up for your office. I will come to you.

Can you give me a quick update that I can send to John Nowlan re Vinmar and 
the other case( I cannot remember the name of the case)

After your arbitration is over, can you give me a quick (and short) update on 
Pacific Virgo that I can forward to John Nowlan.

Two Questions for you Mike:

1) What relationship does Sen. Dunn have W/ Aguirre or Milberg Weiss---has 
hein the recent past, or is he now joint venturing cases with them?

2) Does the Lt. Gov have any ability by reason of his office to get access to 
the materials given to Sen. Dunn.

Robin:

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to the 
issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch trial 
lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

I admit that this is a little unclear--sorry. Obviously, I am heading up the 
overall CA litigation strategy for Enron. Robin Gibbs in Houston is our lead 
trial counsel in all the CA cases. He is out of Houston. Mike Kirby was hired 
as local counsel in the San Diego cases, but both Robin and I have been 
impressed with his judgment and we would like to expand his role a bit. I 
have asked him to lead the Sen Dunn response but he is coordinating closely 
with me and Robin. Is this as clear as mud?

Sandi-to follow up our telephone conference this afternoon, I understand that 
the hearing in Irvine will be this Friday, May 18 at 9:00, rather than 
Thursday, May 17. I will be there and will await receipt of the specific 
address. I called Heather and she is faxing me a map of the location. As I 
indicated, and as Richard Sanders mentioned in the earlier conference call 
today, I am taking the lead in dealing with Sen Dunn on behalf of Enron. 
Please send to my attention the transcripts of the prior hearings and any 
videotapes. I will make sure they get copied and distributed to everyone who 
needs them. The firm name is Post Kirby Noonan & Sweat LLP, 600 West 
Broadway, Suite 1100, San Diego, CA 92101. The phone is 619-231-8666, and my 
direct dial is 619-557-4402. The fax is 619-231-9593 and my cell phone is 
619-871-8121. This should cover everything you requested. I look forward to 
meeting you in Irvine on Friday.Thanks.

What position should I take?
	"Jeffrey A. Krieger" <jkrieger@ggfcmk.com>
	05/15/2001 11:42 PM
		 
Howard Weg has asked that I poll the committee members because several 
members of the committee have advised that they believe we should take a 
position supporting PG&E's motion to vacate the UST's appointment of a 
Ratepayers' committee in the PG&E bankruptcy case.  The idea is to file a 
brief joinder stating that the Participants' Committee in the CalPX case, 
representing constituents which are the real parties in interest of over $1.9 
billion in claims against PG&E, as scheduled by PG&E in its list of 20 
largest creditors, supports the motion and the joinder filed by the PG&E 
creditors' committee.  Our joinder would state that there is no statutory 
basis for appointing a ratepayers' committee and that it is not in the best 
interest of the estate.  We might also indicate that we agree with PGE and 
the PGE creditors' committee that there are other means for ratepayers to be 
heard which make more sense than giving them official committee status.  We 
would also appear telephonically at the hearing, this Friday, at 10 a.m.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like a conference call on 
this issue.  Also, please let me know as soon as possible if you object to 
the committee taking this position.

Thank you.

Hi Richard--

I had dinner with Gilles August, the managing partner of the firm, on 
Friday.  I think his firm is exactly what you are looking for.  They have a 
number of partners who had high level partners in the Government.  However, 
they also have a strong litigation group if that does not work out.  As I 
said last week, their firm patterns itself after US firms.  Gilles himself is 
a member of the New York bar.

I asked Gilles to send you information concerning his firm directly.  Gilles 
tells me that he is going to be in Texas on business sometime soon.  He would 
be happy to stop by and visit with your legal team.

Gina--Will you please e-mail Gilles Richard Sanders contact information, 
including his e-mail address, his office address and phone contact 
information.

schedule might slip to some extent.

The other possible candidates that I have heard about are the Susman Godfrey
firm, the Kaye Scholer firm (although I am waiting to see a preliminary
resume to share with the Subcommittee to decide if we want to see them) and
David Boise (spelling? the attorney that represent Al Gore in the ballot

I am writing for your approval to enter into an agreement on behalf of Enron
and the Enron outside counsel to enable all of us to have access to the
joint work product website for the Gordon Hendricks group.  The Website will
have the following information:

Event Calendar
Docket and pleadings for Electricity Litigation around the West
Pleadings in the major cases we are all in
Repository for all working drafts of documents
Repository for letters that are now circulated as attachments

In the future, some defendants may use this system for actual document
productions to government agencies etc.

As I see it, we really have not choice but to join this system if we are
going to participate in the joint defense group.  Shortly they will stop
circulating work product etc. via email and will rely upon this website
instead.

The costs are somewhat unclear but it is intended to be an economy of scale
cost sharing concept.

They cannot start the program until we all sign up and so they are asking
for a quick response.

Thanks
Gary

at least someone in the state has a sense of humor

	
		 
Rollin', rollin', rollin',
Though the state is golden,
Keep them blackouts rollin', statewide. A little colder weather,
And we all freeze together,
Wishin' more plants were on the line.
All the things I'm missin',
Like lights and television,
Are waiting 'til we can pay the price.

 (Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide!

Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them rates a-movin', statewide.
Don't try to understand 'em,
Just raise, charge, and collect 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
My heart's calculatin',
Nuclear plants will be awaitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.

 (Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide! STATEWIDE!! ! Hyaah!!

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers    Sunday, May 
20, 2001 
  

Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by 
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, 
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy 
industry workers. 

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also 
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are 
supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 

The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was 
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four 
times as much as a year ago. 

Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters 
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to 
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 

Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant 
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of 
constricting supply. 

But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were 
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed 
to the plants' deteriorating condition. 

"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the 
ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, 
he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game 
something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units 
up." 

Unusual phone calls 

Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. 
say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early 
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's 
headquarters in Houston. 

According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations 
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as 
many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room 
computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call 
to ramp the units back up. 

"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who 
only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear 
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market 
change." 

The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a 
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in 
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one 
of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 

"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading 
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl 
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that 
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to 
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 

Corporate denial 

Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to 
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have 
asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, 
decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 

While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as 
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the 
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 

"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California 
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an 
operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), 
they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within 
an hour." 

Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers 
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it 
first. 

The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but 
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used 
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the 
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid 
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one 
of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 

Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment 
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source 
familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to 
have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business 
practices laws. 

Invisible practice 

How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 

One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually 
invisible to regulators and grid operators. 

When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain 
amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an 
average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot 
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount of energy required. 

The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their 
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. 
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity 
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the output was back at the expected level. 

Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if 
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the 
price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 

The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of 
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more 
aggressive than others. 

"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they 
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go up. 

"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd 
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 
'Bring it down again.' " 

Rapid changes 

These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from 
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of 
the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which 
also reduced wear and tear. 

"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the 
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on 
the units." 

ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on 
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when 
companies were withholding power. 

But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in 
driving up energy prices. 

A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day 
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of 
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost 
among those companies. 

Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for 
more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their 
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity 
from all sources. 

Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state 
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. 
(278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 

Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 

Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 

accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an 
operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the 
result of legitimate equipment failures. 

Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of 
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so 
the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 

But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at 
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously 
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was 
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit 
offline because of the problem. 

Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to 
keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for 
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary 
maintenance. 

Ramping may be rampant 

Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source 
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs 
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling 
calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in 
Minneapolis, he said. 

Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo 
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 

In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the 
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 

One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple 
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price was not met. 

On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be 
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt 
hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 

"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

Regarding your friends who have the working interest in the Bowen #1 and #2 
wells in Panola County, I've had the gas contracts system checked and  
Houston Pipe Line Company does not purchase gas from Hydrocarbon Lease 
Management in that county.  The only county in which HPL purchases gas from 
HLM is a well in Matagorda County.  There are no records of gas purchases 
from any well called Bowen #1 or Bowen #2.   If they have well meter numbers, 
we can run a check that way but it doesn't look like HPL is the gas purchaser.

Yes. Please talk to me about the schedule.

I spoke with Gordon.  The assets that he knew about were ones that we have 
already looked at.  I was very nice and told him that I was appreciative of 
his notifying us about them.  

I owe him a call to tell him whether we are still pursuing these projects or 
whether we have given up on them.  Gordon wanted to be sure that we had no 
interest before bringing these projects to his other clients' attention.

Personal and Confidential
Privileged Solicitor and Client Communication

As many of you know, I met with Chris Calger yesterday in Portland.  I
will be preparing a memorandum of my conversation with Chris which I
will ask him to review for distribution.  In summary, Chris was frank
and open, and in my view, expressed genuine corporate concern with the
investigation.  I believe that my notes will indicate that Chris did not
have direct contact with PowerX in connection with any particular trade
during the period being investigated by the government.  Although, in my
view, Chris had general knowledge of Enron*s approach taken in
connection with bidding power into the pool, he did not see himself as
spearheading or orchestrating that process.  I hope to prepare my memo
today for review by Chris later in the day.

PowerX has retained the law firm of Lawson Lundell in Vancouver to
represent their interest.  The lawyer is Chris Sanderson who is a senior
member of the B.C. and Alberta Bars.  His practice focuses on regulatory
law and civil litigation, particularly in the energy industry.

I spoke to Chris Sanderson today to introduce myself and to give him a
very general background on the investigation conducted at the Calgary
office.  He reported that a similar investigation had taken place in the
PowerX office in Vancouver.  Their investigation started at the same
time as ours and ended on Thursday of last week.

Chris Sanderson did confirm that there are tapes of conversations with
Enron involving these various trades.  As a result, I suspect that these
tapes ought to contain the same dialogue that is contained on our tapes.
 I did not get into any discussion as to the information that may be
contained on the tapes and exactly what information had been seized by
the government.  I did get the impression, however, that the government
has taken possession of tapes from PowerX.

He indicated that in his preliminary view the documents themselves are
not the concern but the tapes are.  Again, I did not discuss any
particular matter with respect to the tapes only that Enron did keep
taped conversations of trades undertaken by its traders.

I think it would be worthwhile, and he agreed, if Glenn Leslie and I,
and perhaps Web, met with Chris at the appropriate time.  He is open to
entertain a dialogue between counsel subject of course to matters of
privilege and commonality of interest.

He indicated that he wants to take approximately two weeks to review the
evidence obtained by the investigators (he has not done so yet and
preferred having a firm knowledge of the information seized by the
government before talking to us) and thereafter, initiate a dialogue
with us to see what information might be worth sharing.

I will have Glenn Leslie give him a call to try to set a date when we
might meet with him.  We might want to discuss briefly during our
telephone conference on Friday our approach to meeting with Lawson
Lundell and what would be our ultimate objectives in doing so.

Yesterday, I talked to Cliff O*Brien, the counsel retained for John
Lavorato, and tried to give him a very brief overview of the issues.
Unfortunately, I was at the Portland airport when I did talk to him and
had to keep my conversation somewhat cryptic.  Cliff did meet with John
Lavorato for approximately two hours last night.  Cliff called me this
morning and would like to meet with me.  I will meet him at 4:00 today.
Cliff indicated that the matter was more complex than he had imagined
and expressed a view that in John*s opinion these were simple trades and
nothing else.  I will report to you further on this after I have had a
chance to meet with Cliff O*Brien.

If any of you have any questions, please don*t hesitate to call.  In any
event, we will be talking at our regularly scheduled conference call
Friday at 10:30 (central time).

Regards,

Dan

I have had several more conversations that convince me that FERC will provide 
very helpful answers to the three quesitions that Robin sent to me regarding 
FERC's jurisdiction over the issues in the California cases.

You should be aware of timing issues.  Two of FERC's five positions (both 
Republican or Independent) are vacant, but soon to be filled by nominated 
candidates.  Both nominees (Pat Wood and Nora Brownell) are expected to be 
helpful to our interests.   If we suceed in getting a U.S. district court 
judge to sollicit FERC's view befor the  two new nominees are seated, there 
may be a slight risk that members of Congress will hold their nominations 
hostage over the issue of how FERC answers the court.

I have copied Linda Robertson, the head of Enron's Washington shop, so that 
she can assess how real this risk is and whether it should influence our 
timing.

Last night's game was rescheduled for 4 June.  They're going to skip
Wakefield's turn, so Pedro's pitching on 24 May.  That means that if
things stay the same, he'd pitch on Thursday, 21 June and miss that
weekend against the Blue Jays entirely.

But heck, 2-0 games are boring, right?

Do you have a list of the PX participants committee that you could send me by 
e-mail.

John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David 
Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, 
learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. 
I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the 
Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a 
release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a 
Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in 
Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position 
in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?

I think it would be worth pursuing that option with your client.  If it
meant the involvement of your firm (to any significant extent), the

I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
you.

Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's

PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of 
collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting 
perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting

I am flyingt to LA tonight(Mon) and can be reached at 713-410-6128. The last 
I heard, Susman was coming. Whether Steve Susman comes remains to be seen.

Here is an email I received from the Susman Godfrey firm about their
interest in representing the Participants Committee in the commandeering
matter.

Howard,

My partner Steve Susman forwarded me a copy of your email to him.  Our firm
looks forward to meeting with your committee on Wednesday.  While I had
planned to attend when the interview was scheduled for last Thursday, I
cannot come this week because I am starting trial in Chicago.  I am not sure
yet who from our firm will be attending, but can assure you that we are very
interested in the case.  Whether by ourselves or jointly with Marshall
Grossman and his firm, we think this sort of lawsuit is right up our alley.
We know how to get a complex commercial dispute ready for trial, maximize
its settlement value, or try it successfully if necessary.

I'll try to give you a call Monday or Tuesday to let you know who else from
our firm will be joining Marc Seltzer, who heads our LA office, at the
interview.  You can reach me at 713-653-7827 if you wish.

By the way, there is considerable information about our firm and its lawyers
at our web site, www.susmangodfrey.com

Thanks, Howard.  I look forward to speaking with you.

I have settled the Ecogas/Enron/Randy Maffett lawsuit.  No need to thank 
me,just send me gifts.  Seriously, I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we 
agreed that Ecogas would pay him $53,000.  Hall has agreed to release Enron, 
Ecogas, Maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.  He will 
also release any and all patent issues. The goal is for him to move on with 
his life and for us to move on as well.  I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare 
the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.

Please handle.

Can you pass this along to Elizabeth to ensure Sanders is on board as well?  
We are renewing our L/C's on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders.  
However, the request below is to "replenish" the CASH that was drawn 
down...please advise.

I agree with Steve's position stated in his separate e'mail.  Don't give 
these guys a penny.----cgy

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was 
excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping 
required levels available?

Participant:

Pursuant  to  your  written  request  and  in  accordance  with  the 
Preliminary
Injunction  issued on March 5, 2001 by the Court in Enron Power Marketing, 
Inc.,
et  al.  v.  California  Power Exchange Corporation, USDC Case No. 01-00901, 
the
California Power Exchange Corporation (CalPX) applied cash collateral 
maintained
by Enron Power Marketing, Inc. in payment of the following invoices:

          Dec RT F   $ 15,297.24
                Jan RT P    $ 64,547.04
                Jan RT F    $   2,255.74

Enron Power Marketing, Inc. has not restored such collateral.  Please be 
advised
that  the  Preliminary Injunction requires CalPX market participants to 
maintain
their current levels of collateral while the FERC Proceeding and the 
Preliminary
Injunction  are  in  effect,  and  allows CalPX to take any necessary actions 
to
preserve such collateral.

Is this guy a problem for us in the litigation? I can talk to the Duke attys 
re preserving Enron's proprietary info.

I think the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the UC/CSU contract in the 
SDG&E service area.  Richard, I think you are included because  EES will be 
briefing John Lavarato later this week.  Bob, can you bring Richard up to

I am scheduled to go to the Lakers game. Sorry.

Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?

I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be
part of the group as well.  But it occurs to me that maybe no one talked to
you about it.

Are you interested?

Natwest, McDonald, and PaineWebber have collectively offered the
Farallon/Oaktree plaintiffs (and maybe Legg Mason, I am not sure) $13 million
to settle.  It is clear that this group hopes to persuade SDI and Enron to
contribute something to such a settlement, but they told Hennegan that they
would fund the full $13 million themselves if necessary.  Hennegan is asking
for something in the "high $20s"  I am advised that the settlement group is
prepared to go to the high teens, but it is not clear how much further.

I do not know the allocation of the $13 million among Natwest and McDonald,
except that I believe that Natwest is NOT paying the lion's share, as one
might expect.

If the bargaining proceeds, I am sure that someone will ask Enron to
contribute.

Richard,

Please review the attached fax from Ben Ogletree, one of Natwest's lawyers,
especially the four attached agreements (which Natwest already has.)  Can I
represent to Natwest that these four agreements, along with the Oaktree
settlement agreement, constitute all settlement or cooperation agreements that
we have with any parties to any of NSM litigation?  If I can say that, the
issue of ECT Securities' deposition goes away.

Steve

EES has received a subpoena from the AG.  What outside counsel is advising us 
about these?  Fergus?  Molland?

I talked to Robin about this yesterday in relation to the class actions. I 
think the way we left it was that Jeff Alexander was going to look at the 
issue of transfering venue based on prejudice and get back to me. When do you 
need to make this motion?

	Robert C Williams/ENRON@enronXgate
	05/31/2001 03:06 PM
		 
Richard,

Do we need to consider filing a motion to transfer venue of this case on the 
ground of bias in the jury pool?  Do we prejudice your cases if we don't?

I am a little behind the curve--nothing new. Has this been resolved? Other 
than knowing what is happening, what do I need to do?

Have we received a settlement offer? I saw Kevin Presto yesterday and he 
asked me about it. Lets talk today.

 Andy:

 To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpine
matter.

 I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone on
Friday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the office
until May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.
I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was
"working on" getting me a reply.

 We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make a
settlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion to
compel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its power
purchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for a
protective order which would limit their production to the contracts in
ERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 11. Second, we won our motion
to continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summary
judgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but the
court ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of its
ruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Our
supplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 22.  Third,
Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order from
the court requiring us to produce additional information on our damage
claim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which we
detailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to update
some of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman's
deposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this.

 Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon's
deposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduled
for June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In addition
to the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleading
amendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. We
have already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We have
drafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the case
was removed from state court and we were still on the state court original
petition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleading
ambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsic
evidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative.

 I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to our
settlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if you
have questions or comments on any of these matters.

 Best regards,

 Bill

I have sent you a check. I will take more tickets if someone drops out.

I have received an invoice from the Rockets for next season's tickets. The
total amount is $19,712.00, or $112 per seat. According to the Rockets,
there will be no increase for this season or the 2002/2003 season (but wait
until the new arena is built in 2003!). The breakdown is as follows:
Bill Gage (25%): $4928 (less $736 previously paid);
Bob Roten (25%): $4928;
Glenn Ballard (12.5%): $2464;
Pat Doherty (12.5%): $2464;
Richard Sanders (12.5%): $2464; and
Bill Eggleston (12.5%): $2464.
If you want to renew, I need your check by June 15. If you do not want to
renew, call me as soon as possible at 713/659-5100.

Sorry for the late reply. You are correct about  the policy.

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word 
document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed 
automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been 
telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if 
they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention 
period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine 
Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston 
Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris 
County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson 
(an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck 
negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as 
a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the 
course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of 
it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

Thanks

I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first 
time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain 
check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am 
here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am 
in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am 
and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy 
in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about 
lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week?

When are you in town, so we can have dinner?

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch

it's tough because for a huge city with lots of lawyers there really aren't 
many business trial lawyers there.  its not like texas or california.

we know david boies well and have done a number of things with him.  he might 
be interested because there is so much at stake and it is so high profile.  
of course, tho, he is stretched way way too thin and doesn't really have that 
much depth in his firm.  we could pitch it to him that we'll provide the back 
up, if you want.

another idea is david foster at willkie farr.  widely regarded in the city as 
one of the best trial lawyers. confidentially, we will be opening a nyc 
office by sept, and are negotiating with foster about his joining us.  i 
could put you in touch with some general counsel who think very highly of 
him.  again, we could provide coordination and back up if you like.  of 
course there would be value in maintaining consistency of positions in new 
york and california, less learning curve, etc.  i am a member of the new york 
bar as are about 8 of our partners.

 Per your request for an update:

 1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in 
this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

 2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our 
solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar 
defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

 3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % 
reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, 
Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, 
Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim 
again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do 
not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

 I will keep you advised.

Richard -

I have a company with whom we are negotiating a non-disclosure agreement.  We 
have been working off of their form, but have inserted our arbitration 
language.  We have put in New York as the operative law and they have 
responded with either Minnesota (their home jurisdiction) or Delaware (the 
state of their incorporation).  I have told them that Minnesota will not work 
and that we prefer NY, but they are holding the line on having Delaware.

Do we have a problem with Delaware for jurisdiction?  Also, this is a 
non-disclosure agreement and any subsequent  agreement would have to be 
negotiated as to forum.

Thanks for your response.

See below.  Farallon has moved for summary judgment against Natwest, McDonald,
and PaineWebber.  If the motion is credible, it should ratchet up the pressure
on those three defendants to settle.  Assuming that we don't want to be the
only defendant at trial (or one of two, SDI being the other), we need to
follow the settlement negotiations as closely as we can and try to get in
(while appearing uninterested), or make a separate deal, at the last minute.

The key to getting current information on settlement efforts by the other
defendants is Mike Diamond.  Because Mike still wants Richard's business, and
Mike and I are close, Mike is likely to be pretty forthcoming if Richard or I
ask him what is going on.

A couple of things:

(1)  I hope you are dry

(2)  Rebecca McDonald's prep session is supposed to be at 10 a.m. today.  In 
the event no postponement of her depo was agreed to, Robert Rivera is 
planning to be at McDonald's office at 10 a.m.  I don't know if Mark Lowes 
will be there or not.  I told McDonald's assistant that it was up to her 
whether to have Mark there or not.  By the way, please let me know by e-mail 
what is up with the settlement talks.

(3)  Do you still need Red Sox tickets?  If so, let me know.  Cliff and I 
worked quite a bit with a firm up in Boston (Hill & Barlow) and I am sure I 
could have them find tickets for you.

Later.

Can you make sure that this goes to El Paso. I assume that we dont need to do 
anything else(?)

This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen 
Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technologies 
Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the 
Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy 
Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effective 
late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & English to 
represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters 
before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  This matter 
relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at 
a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  David Waterson 
of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity 
obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this 
incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to determine if 
any such obligations exist.

The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and 
to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Cogen 
case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as 
Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the 
construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have asked Becky 
Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or 
NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of process is 
in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it.  As this 
new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am forwarding a 
copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process and investigate 
the claim in your usual manner. 

Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to 
begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.  Thanks.

Richrd - I'd like to stop by in the next few days for a quick update me on 
the CA litigation - I've been away on vacation and hear there have been a few 
recent developments.  Thanks

Yes-- but lets wait until you and I can talk live.

Great!  Now, what have you done for me lately?  The ETS entities are 
apparently still in this case and I'm feeling lonely already now that ENA is 
bugging out.  Where is our deal with Boies to get Quinn in and us out?  
Thanks for the help on this Andy.  DF

I am glad to report that we have received word from Rex Sharp, the 
plaintiffs' lawyer in the Quinque litigation, that he intends to dismiss 
I will keep you updated.

We have been given a new list of potential arbitrators.  Please take a minute 
and let me know if any of these represent us, and the general level of 
representation.  Thank you again for your help.  If you want to leave me a 
voicemail, my telephone number is (713) 646-6412.

     1.  William Frank Carroll--Donohoe, Jameson & Carroll
     2.  James E. Coleman Jr.--Carrington, Coleman, Sloman & Blumenthal
     3.  Randall Duke--Johnson & McElroy
     4.  Edward Fiorito--Consultant

No need to respond as to V&E or Locke Liddell, except as to information about 
the individuals.  Steve et al.,  Baker & McKenzie does represent Enron on 
several matters of which I am aware, but to my knowledge it is not one of our 
top 10 firms in billings.

After conferring with Rob Cole, I will make my recommendation to Mr. Derrick 
today as to local counsel so that we may get a responsive pleading on file in 
a timely fashion. Thereafter, Rob and I will coordinate the defense with 
local counsel and report in the usual fashion.

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced 
case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The 
Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had 
previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined 
that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT 
owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be 
handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the 
activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this 
matter, please contact Dave. 

Thanks.

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the
preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.

Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will
allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY
FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.

In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when
hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2.   What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for
failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this
policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

 In looking at the Natole file today it was brought to my attention that we

 The bill is invoice 00020782 dated 2/29/00 in the amount of $17,312.28.

 Could you please have someone look for this one and see if it can be

Roland and I are currently scheduled to arrive in Houston (i.e., the airport) 
next week at 12:30pm on Wednesday and depart at 5:30pm on Thursday.? There 
are lots of flights, so we can certainly come sooner and leave later if that 
is desirable.

I talked to Mike Swartz.? He does understand that he is to ask only questions 
designed to prepare him for depostions of Busse and Nolan of Steel 
Dynamics.?? I told him that he might be asking questions by himself, or he 
might be in with other lawyers.? (He seemed surprised that other lawyers 
might be there.)

If we can work it out, I think it would be best to have Kevin and Brian 
interviewed by Swartz separately rather than with other lawyers.? If Mike is 
in the large group interviews, I fear that we will not, as a practical 
matter, be able to draw the kinds of lines that we would like to.? For 
example, I would just as soon not have Farallon's counsel present when Kevin 
or Brian addresses the questions in Robins, Kaplan's letter of 6/13 that I 
just received.

Richard:
 I have spoken again today with Tom Deen, the lawyer for Natole Turbine.
 Deen still wants to mediate the case, but after talking with his client he
wants to depose Anderson, Leather, Virgo and Miller first. He says the
depositions of Virgo and Miller will be short (1/2 day each) and he wants to
try and schedule the depositions for the week of July 10. I am available
July 11, 12, 13 or 14 that week. By copy of this email, I am asking that
Miller and Virgo each advise me as to their availability then, or if
unavailable, the nearest alternate dates possible for each of them.
 I remind everyone that this case has a trial setting on September 4.
If we cannot complete this initial discovery and set a mediation promptly,
we will have the Hobson's choice either to delay the case further, or try it
with relatively little preparation time.
 I ask that Messrs. Miller and Virgo let me know about their schedules,
either by reply email, or call me at 713-844-3001.
 Thank you for your time and assistance.

 Best regards,
 Bill Ogden

agreement that we typically use with service providers.  Please call me with

Richard --

Here's the draft.  They might come back with some response that our
agreement is not unconditional, but if they do not participate in the
redetermination process, they run the risk of losing the right to do so.

The last line is for you.

Richard,

I am forwarding an e-mail that I received today from Durango Petroleum re the 
Collins matter in Hardin County.  I spoke with the company president today.  
He believes that they do not have any exposure but would like to settle the 
matter as they believe it will cost them more than $5000 to hire counsel to 
defend it.  I told him that I did not believe that HPL would be inclined to 
pay $5000 to settle the case, but that I would pass along his request.  I am 
concerned about his statement in the letter re having given HPL notice over a 
year ago to remove the pipe/valve.  I asked him if he had any correspondence 
or other evidence of that .  He will check and get back to us.  Lisa 
Robichaux will determine whether our right of way group has anything in its 
file placing us on notice that we no longer had the right to be on the land.  
If we received notice and ignored it, we may want to consider contributing to 
a settlement since they would have at least some evidence to attempt to prove 
intentional trespass.  However, I still believe that Collins will have a 
difficult time proving any actual damages.  We need to be cautious about not 
getting into a situation in which Durango/IP Petroleum would end up helping 
Collins to prove his case.  

Eileen Kisluk will be working on this matter in my absence over the next two 
weeks.  We just received notice that the case was set for trial on August 
17.  Plaintiff had not done any discovery before setting it for trial.  He 
sent out requests for disclosure and a few interrogatories/requests for 
production along with the notice of trial setting.  Lisa Robichaux will work 
with John Towles in Right of Way to gather the information.  We also intend 
to send out a notice of deposition of Collins for the week I return 
(July24).  In the meantime, if you agree, I intend to file a motion for 
continuance since Durango would like one, Collins did not give us notice of 
his request for trial setting and I will be out due to wedding/honeymoon.  
However, we will be prepared to go forward in the event that it is not 
granted.  I will be in the office until approximately noon tomorrow if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Stuart -

Fyi.  Talked to Pete a few minutes ago.  We filed a warranty claim with 
Westinghouse.  We will be running all units tomorrow, and we'll have a 
Westinghouse engineer there to work on the problem.  Pete has since called 
all the people below back to explain what we are doing to verify whether 
there is a problem or not.

Mitch
Pete McCormick@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
07/10/2000 12:36 PM
Well, it continues. We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations 
resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each 
individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to 
listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little 
frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been 
unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings 
visiting their residence.

Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the 
closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I 
was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points 
feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this 
residence.

Mr & Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit 
their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.

Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her 
and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but 
while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations 
occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.

Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of 
trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the 
trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not 
determine if Vibrations were present or not.

Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all 
other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his 
dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his 
residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience 
some noise and vibration.

In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just 
temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we 
can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to 
be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the 
exhaust transition that they need to investigate. 

I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this 
problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying 
to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if 
this is possible.

We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, 
Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.

Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats 
why I want to get everyone out here if possible.

Gail Brownfeld (Senior Counsel) has required that all EE&CC back up mail 
files be reviewed and any information pertaining to the following files be 
reproduced for the upcoming EE&CC litigation efforts.

1.  Any messages TO or FROM the following people that have the "extension"  
@bv.com for the time period 1992 to date. 

 Jim Leblanc
 Karl Breckon
 Ricky Simon
 Frank Hosak
 Larry Snyder
 Ray McPhail
 Bill Fox
 John O'Hearn

2.  Also, the following people from Black & Veatch worked in the EECC Houston 
office in 1995 and had Enron mail accounts.  Therefore we would need ANY 
email to/from these accounts:

 Eric Odenhouse
 Gary Townsend
 Robert Wood
 Bruce Godsey
 John Kruse

Ms. Brownfeld indicated that the document review by Enron's outside counsel 
has a six week window.  This is week two of those six week.  Therefore, it 
has been requested that this task receive top priority.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or require addtional information.

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

John, 
             We were dug up at two locations between Liberty and Beaumont by 
a contractor working for PF Net on Monday, June 26.  The contractor was 
Dan-Rik Construction Company out of Lafayette, La.   The contractor hit and 
damaged our facility at two locations, one being between our existing splice 
# 1 and splice #2,  three thousand feet of China.   The other location is 
under a canal, in the same vicinity.  

   The contractor contact information is : Dan Rik Construction Company
                                                                             
PO Box 92868
                                                                             
Lafayette, La. 70509
                                                                         
                                                                             
Tel: 318.232.2488

They are a sub-contractor to: Manuel Brothers, Inc.
                                                          908 Taylorville

                                                           Tel: 530.272.4213

   We are in the process of  restoring our facilities and will invoice 'Dan 
Rik Construction'  all costs associated with the restoration.   PF Net is 
following our route through Texas into Louisiana and I am concerned about 
dig-ups that may occur bwtween China and the Louisiana border.  Is an 
injunction the only way to keep them a safe and reasonable distance from our 
facitlity?  Can we somehow put them on notice that we won't tolerate any 
future dig-ups and that if they do  damage our facility, we will replace it 
from splice to splice at their expense?  Please let me know.  

Thank you.

Brad:

First, let me say yes, if you want me to, I can write the company and "put
them on notice" that you will invoice them. Also, alert them that we would
consider court action if it occured again.  Let me know and I will proceed.

Second, yes, we could file an injunction if necessary Obviously that would
involve more time and expense, hearing, probably opposition by the other
company and see what a court would do.  We could use as grounds they have
already done it, are working in the area and, unless under court order to
stay a distance away, would be likely do it again.  Also, we could ask for
damages for everything involved by EBS, repair, disruption, etc.

Both of these are things that Richard Sanders would have a view on I am
sure, so I am cc'ing him on this.  Again, let me know what you would like to
do re court action.

I will await hearing from you.

time.

The dial in number for this call is 1-800-998-2462.  The pincode is 4309724.

1. You are right ---something is off about this guy. His behavior is 
irrational.
2. You are right--- you are obsessing about this too much. Relax and go back 
on vacation.
3. I handle personal matters for people all the time. This one is pretty 
minor. If it becomes more involved, we can talk about it then.
4. Relax and go back on vacation.

working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy 
over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation 
does not send a letter or bring up this "Chrome Dreams" issue from 1986 with 
us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge.

This guys sounds a little off.

going to be there. Late last week, Julie and I decided to go to Austin 
instead of her coming to Houston for the weekend. I called Doug and told him 
we were coming. My approach is that if he wants to say no he has one chance 
to to so. He didn't say no.

I should have called you earlier. Julie must have told me to call you 5 times 
on Sat. The truth is I am so freaking tired that I just didn't do it until 
Sun. We did want to stop by and visit but we will catch you next time. Love 
Richard

 On July 12, service of process forms in these matters were forwarded to 
you.  To our knowledge, we have not received any instructions from ENA or GPG 
to go forward.  If this is in error, or if you do require representation from 
the Unit, please let me know.  Many thanks.

         B.K.D.

Unless their is a reason having to do with the case( ie we can somehow 
recover our attys fees} I see no reason why we should separate the bills.Send 
me one bill.

Richard: 

Spending a block of time on Busse's deposition this week focuses me on a 
question that we have never really discussed:? How would you like Milbank to? 
allocate its time between the Farallon and Legg-Mason cases?

To date, without really discussing it with you, we have (1) billed the 
Farallon and Legg-Mason cases separately and (2) allocated our time 
specifically relating to each case to that case but allocated "common" time 
entirely to the Farallon case.

Is this what you want? 

Should we just send one bill for the two cases together? 

If we continue separate bills, what should be the allocation principle?? 
Should common time be allocated all to Farallon (the current practice)?? 
divided 50/50 between the two cases?? divided 18/5 between the two cases 
(i.e., allocated by the respective amounts in issue in the two cases) ?

Any thoughts?

I just got back from vacation and  read your e-mail regarding this 
bankruptcy.  Keeping that in mind, no bells are ringing about this 
bankruptcy.  If a POC was filed, it was done by Bonnie.  She handles most 
everything (inhouse) for us.  Please check her files.  I assume that Britt is 
stepping in for her while she's on vacation????  Let me know if you find a 
POC (if none was filed, then the ballot issue appears to be moot).

Thanks,
Linda

	Brenda McAfee@ENRON
	07/13/2000 02:22 PM
		 
Linda,
 Bonnie White asked me to work with you on gathering information about this 
bankruptcy.  The following sets forth the deadline schedule that I obtained 
from Pacer regarding this matter:

 1)  6/12/00   - Voting Record Date to determine which creditors or entitled 
to vote to 
       accept or reject the Plan
 2)  7/21/00 @ 4:00 pm  - Objections due to Confirmation of the Plan
 3)  7/21/00 @ 4:00 pm  - Deadline for ballots to accept or reject the Plan

 4)  7/27/00 @ 9:30 am  - Confirmation hearing on the Plan
 5)  7/31/00 @ 4:00 pm  - Objections due to assignment by Adair Supply
 6)  8/14/00 @ 11:30 am  - Hearing re objections to claims of Enogex Expl.

I obtained from PACER a copy of the Claims Register Report and it lists ECT 
as having filed a claim on 3/23/00--but it does not reflect how much is the 
total claim.  Also, included in Debtor's 2d Amended Jt Disclosure Statement, 
it reflects that  Class 4 Creditors consists of all Allowed Unsecured Claims 
including ECT's claim arising from the termination of an Option (Corridor) 
dated 5/28/99 between MPC and Enron and the Confirmation of an Option 
(Collar) dated 11/6/98 between MPC and Enron (the "Enron Swaps").

I would appreciate your help with answering the following questions:

1)  Was a Proof of Claim filed on behalf of ECT and for how much?
2)  Who is the person who will handle filing out and signing the Ballot on 
behalf of ECT either rejecting or accepting the Plan
 [which is due to be filed on or before 7/21/00].
3)  If we are not owed any monies by Michael Petroleum, or have not asserted 
a claim against Michael Petroleum, then we
 can disregard sending in the ballot on behalf of ECT.     

I have copies of all these documents, so if you need me to send you anything, 
please let me know.  I appreciate your help with this and please call me if 
any of this information is confusing.  Brenda x3-6536

I doubt that I am the correct person to explain the Infineum 
matter--actually, I know that I am not. Should one of our litigators be 
involved in this discussion?

When Bill gets back to his office (around 3:30 ECT) we will give you a call
to discuss.  If possible, it would also be helpful to get an update on
progress made on understanding the claim filed by Infineum and possible
meeting times later next week to discuss the case with LeBouf, Lamb.

This is to advise you that there are two nationwide private natural gas 
royalty cases that have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas before 
Judge Hannah.  Neither lists Enron Corp or any of its subsidiaries as a 
defendant.  Both cases are class actions.  Neither is a Qui Tam action.  The 
allegations are similar to those in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.

The first, in Civil Action 9:99cv255, was filed September 20, 1999.  The 
plaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.  The defendants are Mobil 
Oil Corporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing 
Southeast, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas & New Mexico, Inc. and 
Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. 

The second, Civil Action 9:00cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.  The plaintiffs 
are Melanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, 
WI.  The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration & Production 
Company, Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading 
Company.

Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing the 
plaintiffs in both cases.  Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming & Asso. of 
Houston, signed the Stirman complaint.

Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website at 
www.edtx.uscourts.gov.  Enter the site and look under "Frequently Requested 
Cases".  You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.

Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsaker 
told me that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had  been dropped 
as defendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities were 
named in  Original and First Original Amended Complaints),  both are again 
named as defendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed 
on June 13, 2000.    The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the 
plaintiffs, had a conflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron 
and EOG to preserve the case.  That conflict has now been resolved.  The June 
13 complaint is not yet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.

If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843.

 

I talked to Delainey last week and he said he wanted to have a meeting to 
discuss. This analysis is interesting.

Attached please find the revised summary for Antara.  Please delete the 
previous file you received and replace with this version.

Pricing has the biggest impact on valuation from where we were 6 months ago, 
as depicted in the operations cash flow section for the Gulf Coast.

As discussed, risk factors are estimates and are subjective.

The Proved Undeveloped (PUD) reserves in the Rockies are based on the 
Netherland and Sewell (NSA) 1/1/99 reserve report and do not reflect what 
Enron thought 6 months ago.  Our in-house estimates of the PUD reserves are 
50-75% of NSA and would indicate a current unrisked value for the PUDs of 
perhaps $4-5 million.  However, a potential acquirer may just use the NSA 
numbers and risk adjust as I have done in the spreadsheet.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jim Ledlow

Sorry about the delay in getting back to you. I would do a separate heading. 
I am not sure who needs to approve this other than me. When Whalley was head 
trader and COO, he approved. I do not know if it should be Lavo or Delainey. 
If you know, send it to me and I will get it signed. If you are uncertain, my 
paralegal, Linda Guinn, will find out.

Richard, further to my voice-mail, I was just following up as to how you 
would like to proceed with addressing Enron Canada Corp. in the new tape 
retention policy.  As I had indicated, Rob Milnthorp has requested that the 
following two Enron Canada positions have authority to approve the listening 
of voice recordings in the Calgary office, on behalf of Enron Canada Corp.:

Chief Executive Officer
Head of Trading

Rob's preference is not to specify particular persons but to identify the 
titles instead.

Can you let me know how you would like to address this issue.  I would think 
it is merely a matter of adding these two positions to the schedule 
identifying who has authority to approve the listening of the tapes.  The 
only problem is that the "Managing Director" wording could conflict with the 
title identification that Rob wants to use for Enron Canada.  Perhaps in that 
schedule, we could add a separate heading for Enron Canada.

Thanks

Greg

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

I am fine with the Chamber of Commerce arbitration, especially in light of 
the small amount of potential exposure. Could you send me a copy of the 
opinion from our local counsel.

	Robert C Williams@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	07/18/2000 04:30 PM
		 
Jim,

As you know, Jeff Skilling has approved opening a trading operation in 
Columbia.   The company's open position at any one time will be no more than 
$500,000.  Jeff Hodge and Francisco Pinto-Leite have been working  on the 
trading contracts.  Our businesspeople inform us that they will not be able 
to obtain counterparties' agreement to international arbitration.  We, for 
our part, are unwilling to agree to refer all disputes to the Colombia 
courts.  The best option appears to be arbitration conducted under the 
auspices of the Bogota Chamber of Commerce.  We have obtained a written 
opinion from local counsel, Figueroa Sierra & Asociados, opining that this 
body has a proven record of conducting arbitrations fairly, without bias, and 
free from corruption.  In particular, foreign parties have been treated 
without discrimination, winning their fair share of awards.  We are 
requesting that we be permitted to accept the Bogota Chamber of Commerce as 
the exclusive forum for resolving any disputes that might arise under our 
trading contracts.   I am aware that we have accepted local arbitration for 
trading disputes in Buenos Aries; I am not sure whether we have done so in 
Europe.

Please let me know if this is acceptable to you, or if would like additional 
information.    

Thank you.

Yes. I am the contact person at Enron. The LLGM attys should send me copies 
of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers, 
counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed. As for 
contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them directly 
for incidental information. Any strategy calls should be made through me. I 
would suggest that they give me the option of participating on the initial 
calls w/ the ECP witnesses. I wil;l likely decline because of time 
constraints. Is that as clear as mud?

papers, questions, etc. in this matter.  Do you want us to be sending any 
drafts of court papers that we prepare, for example, to ECP simultaneously 
with sending them to you or after you have reviewed them?  I assume our 
litigators can contact the ECP folks directly to obtain any information or 
other materials that they may need, but please let me know if you would 
rather that they work through you.  Thanks, Richard.  I hope that all is 
going well.  John

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial operatio=

found that the OPUC could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its=20

I understand that you are the contact  for the Infineum lawsuit.  Please take 
a look at the proposed disclosure.

To bring you guys up to date:

I met with VE and AA on Thursday to discuss assign responsibility for 
appropriate sections of the document.  VE is editing "the Exchange Offer", is 
coordinating edits to "Regulation" with the original ENE drafters of the 
section.  ECP is responsible for drafting/editing the remainder of the 
document.

We discussed a number of relevant issues:
Is this document a "post effective amendment" to the original S-4 filed 12/15 
given that we will not be registering additional securities.  VE is going to 
follow up with our examiner at the exchange to determine if we still have an 
Edgar filing number.  I suspect the answer is no.  VE is also going to 
discuss our approach with the examiner to give him the heads up on what we 
are doing.
Is disclosure of the recap required?  After conversation with Doug Bland we 
came to the conclusion that no disclosure was required.   This was based on 
the facts that 1). no agreement has been entered into.  There is not a term 
sheet etc.  2).  We will need lender consent.
There will be disclosure of the Infineum litigation.  See below for draft 
language.  Please forward any comments to me.

Timing:
Monday evening - turn changes though the F pages Monday evening.
Mon/Tues - AA begins SAS 71 review 
Late Tuesday - distribute document (w/o F pages) for preliminary internal 
review. Licato, Evans, Stappenbeck, Keevill, Plants, Mellencamp, Lydecker
Thursday/Friday - Turn F pages

Infineum Litigation
On June 30, 2000, Infineum USA L.P. filed an action against us in the United 
States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking an unspecified 
amount of actual and punitive damages relating to our steam sale agreements 
with Infineum and Bayway Refining.  Infineum's petition claims that our 
existing energy services agreement with Tosco and the related amendment to 
the steam sale agreement with Bayway, interferes with Infineum's ability to 
sell to Bayway steam that Infineum purchases from our Linden facility.  
Infineum calims that such interference is in violation of federal and New 
Jersey antitrust laws, is in breach of our agreement with Infineum and 
tortiously interferes with Infineum's economic relationships with Bayway.  We 
believe the claims made in this litigation are without merit and we intend to 
defend these actions vigorously.  Although no assurances can be given, we 
believe that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 

Please let me know if you have any comments on the above.

Please find the attached weekly report.

Recapping our call w/ Keith Simmons (TEPAC's outside counsel) this afternoon, 
we still have the following issues to resolve (the first three are the most 
important to TEPAC).
(1)  Subrogation against TVA -- Keith doubts that TEPAC would ever agree to 
Section 4.5, despite our expressed need to be able to challenge TVA directly 
on its cut of energy we attempt to deliver or its calculation of Replacement 
Costs.  Keith suggested that Jason and Phil speak directly to Larry Hamilton 
about this subject, and they will attempt to do that soon.  
(2)  Mitigation Duty --  They are not comfortable w/ a duty to mitigate 
Replacement Cost damages that are calculated by TVA b/c they cannot foresee 
circumstances where any action or failure to act could have any impact on 
those damages.  We explained that we wanted the Distributors to have every 
incentive to cooperate w/ us in keeping those damages minimized.  They might 
be willing to concede on this point if we can work out everything else.  
(3)  EPMI's Cover Damages --  They are not very comfortable agreeing to the 
concept that a Distributor would have to pay damages to EPMI b/c they cannot 
imagine how they could be responsible for failing to receive an "into" 
product such as this.  We both agreed to reconsider this.
(4)  Criteria for Enron's rejection of Distributor -- Our right to approve 
Distributors is ok, but they want to add language to prevent EPMI from being 
arbitrary about those approvals.  We agreed.
(5)  Notice of changes to underlying agreements -- Their duty to notify us it 
ok, but they want to add language that is in line w/ their Distributor 
agreements, which don't absolutely require Distributors to tell TEPAC 
everything.  We agreed.
(6)  Request for offers --  They would prefer that EPMI call them every day 
w/ quotes (which is how Williams does it now), rather than having to initiate 
the process.  We described this as our normal way of doing business and they 
agreed.
(7)  Indemnity clause -- We struck a sentence about each party indemnifying 
the other while they have title to the power, which had been included in our 
earlier draft.  I agreed to look into this.  
(8)  Governing Law and Arbitration -- TEPAC is ok w/ NY law, but would prefer 
including a clause requiring EPMI to sue TEPAC or any distributor in 
Tennessee (even tho Keith thinks that would be the legal result anyway).   
They would also prefer to have the arbitration situs in Tennessee.  We both 
agreed to reconsider this.  Richard:  What do you think about that?

Any comments are welcome.

Regards,
Janice

What is your address?

$500.00

Please make the check payable to Julie Parraguirre and deliver it to me at EB

for your help and tell Amanda thanks.

Those things are such a waste of time- trying to condense 8 points of error 
and 6 weeks of trial in a 20 minute argument. Bill did a very good job. The 
opposing counsel quickly reverted to personal attacks against Bill, which did 
not go over well. Union's main point was that the judge wrongly applied La. 
law. Two of the justices expressed doubts about Union's argument. I 
personally think the choice of law argument is a weak argument for Union. The 
remainder of the time was spent analizing a particular provisition of the gas 
purchase agreement between Union and the utility district. In short, you 
didn't miss much.

Please send me a copy of the pleading. fax # 713-646-3393

I wanted to make sure you are aware of this since it may be an ECT issue.  
This is a very minor case ($60K) and the only reason Enron is a named 
defendant is for an accounting of money paid for this disputed gas.  I am 
trying to figure out whether this is EESI or ECT gas.  Some research so far 
indicates that it may be neither of ours.  I will handle this for now and try 
to get us out of this, unless you have a burning desire to deal with 
Plaintiff's counsel in Marietta, OH.  

Please give me a call at 614-791-6181 if you have any questions.  MDS
	Enron Energy Services
	

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a 
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy.  
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS
	Enron Energy Services
	

Do any of you know anything about wellhead purchases in Washington County 
from Jeff Brown, M&J Energy, CMB Investments, James Buckey, Samuel Buckey?

Richard:  actually, it is pretty clear.  We definitely would never file any 
papers without running them through you.  But on drafts of papers should we 
get your clearance first before sending to ECP or should we send out drafts 
to each of you simultaneously.  I assume the latter.  Could you let me know 
if you think differently.  Thanks, Richard, and I'm sure we will be speaking 
soon.  John

of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers,
counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed. As
for contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them

 I am pleased to announce that Kristina Mordaunt has been promoted to Vice 
President and General Counsel, Structured Finance for ECT.

 Kristina joined ECT in 1993 from the Houston law firm of Butler & Binion 
where she specialized in public finance, project finance and asset 
securitized transactions.  Since 1996 she has held the position of Vice 
President and Assistant General Counsel with primary responsibility for the 
legal matters associated with structured finance transactions including off 
balance sheet funding vehicles, structured prepays, monetizations of existing 
assets and financing for acquisitions.

 Please join me in congratulating Kristina on her promotion.

Dude---- I will be in London in late July. How far is it to Poland?

I am familiar with one active case and one threatened litigation involving 
the companies on the Investment Portfolio list.  Steel Dynamics has been sued 
for securities fraud involving the NSM transaction.  Cgas has been threatened 
with litigation by Jerry Jordan, the former CEO.  Jerry Jordan disagrees with 
Cgas' evaluation of the stock he retained (which is subject to a buyout 
provision).  We think it is worth +/- 500,000.  He thinks it is worth +/- 1.5 
million.

Coho Energy Files Suit Against Hicks Muse Affiliates

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 27, 1999--Coho Energy Inc. (Nasdaq:COHO - news)
today announced that it has filed suit against five affiliates of
Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst seeking damages of more than five hundred million
dollars ($500,000,000).

The suit, which was filed on Coho's behalf in state court by the noted Dallas
trial firm of Thomas & Culp, L.L.P., alleges that HM4, a limited partnership
formed by Hicks Muse on behalf of the Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Equity Fund 
IV,
reneged on a contract to inject $250,000,000 of equity capital into the 
Company.
 The deal would have
given HM4 control of Coho through the purchase of 41,666,666 shares of newly
issued common stock at $6.00 per share.

The suit alleges that HM4 waited until after Coho's public stockholders had
approved the agreement, then reneged on the deal at the last minute in order 
to
renegotiate the price down to $4.00
per share in order to increase the number of shares that HM4 would have 
received
 for the $250,000,000. Then according to the allegations, HM4 walked away from
the new agreement.

The Company has opened a Web page at www.coholawsuit.com in order to keep the
public and its stockholders informed of progress in the case. The petition 
filed
 in court will be available in
full text at the Web site at approximately 2:00 p.m., CDT, today.

As to the little work I'll do in the near term reading the pleadings and
talking to Charlie re the Wright case, do you want me to set up a new matter
number or just bill it to the Grynberg file? Please let me know.  As always,
we really appreciate the opportunity to represent you. - Barrett  

Please put this on my calender

Attached please find the deposition/prep. schedule regarding the above.

I will probably be staying at the Savoy. I will be there from July 18 to the 
28th.

Please see the attached Revised Deposition/ Prep Schedule.  This reflects a 
change in the location of the depositions on the 14th and 15th.

Lets get together for lunch.

What about hiking the Pacific trail from Lake Tahoe to Yosemite in June/ July 
of 2000.

I talked to Mark Palmer last week about some other issues and casually 
thanked him for talking to you. His response was somewhat disapointing: " I 
really enjoyed meeting him and he would be great for our Gov. affairs office, 
too bad they have no openings." Sorry for the lackluster interest/bordering 
on rude behavior. Take the transmission wire job, come repackage the deal to 
Enron and get your revenge by getting $mm of dollars from Enron.

yes

How about this Friday ? Julie has not left yet. She was 2 days away from 
leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at 
the school schedule for the first time in several  weeks. Now mind you she 
had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a 
key----to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty 
funny. How many years will it take her to live this down?.

   

when?  how are you and your family?  is julie gone?

Lets get together for lunch.

Looks good---please send.

yes

Richard, OK to produce the three documents that I sent you earlier this 
week?? Steve 

This e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential

the sender and delete this e-mail message from your computer. 

I have no legal issues---send out.

After further thought, it seems to me that in light of our fear of litigation 
w/ American Coal, we should keep the documents. To further insulate the Coal 
Group and you from any claim that Enron misused the information,I suggest 
that you transfer the information to me and I will hold it for safekeeping.

Today is bad. Tommorrow I will call you.

Did you get my last message?

I am not aware of any reason to hold up the suit. ECT is OK

FYI
Please see the attached memorandum from Mary Nell Browning, Richard Harper 
and Paul Turner.

Congrats on your new arrival. I hope all is going well. I had lunch w/ Bill 
Gage today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm. I think 
they are shy about talking to current Bracewell attys. I told him that I had 
talked to you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made 
and that I would pass along the information. If you are interested, Bill's #

Open new matters. Thanks.

Is this the usual way Freshfield bills? Out of principle, I would ask for 
itemize bills. Please give me your thoughts.
Britt Davis@ENRON
06/17/99 10:29 AM
 You may recall that I received a bill from Freshfield's for their work in 
this case in the amount of FF 120,000 (approximately $24,000).  Because it 
was not itemized, I sent it back for itemization.  I have since received from 
Freshfield's a letter of June 11, attaching a description of the services 
performed, but with no mention of the hours spent, either for the whole job, 
or for each item.  I will send a copy of this to you for your review.

 I am not familiar with Freshfield's billing practices generally or whether 
ECT has any agreement with Freshfield's for providing specific billing 
formats.  I do not want to strain ECT's relationship with Freshfield's by 
asking for more information if that is not reasonable to do.

 Richard and Linda, would one of you provide me some guidance as to whether 
you need additional information from Freshfield's or not?  Thanks.

        B.K.D. 

ECT is willing to pay 25%,but we will not agree to pick up any of EOTT's 
share.
Walt Zimmerman@EOTT
06/11/99 07:28 PM
Britt, I did receive a copy of the V&E invoice, but EOTT has not agreed to a 
25% cost allocation for this matter.  EOTT is not a party to any of the 
contracts involving the "sample leases" that are referenced in the subpoena, 
and the subpoena does not appear to be directed to the types of business that 
are conducted by EOTT.  As indicated in memos from Charles Tetrault,  the 
document requests are focused on EOG and ECT.  EOTT is not going to pay 25% 
of the legal fees associated with EOG's and ECT's response to this subpoena.

I do not have a problem with paying 25% of this first bill ($1,250.79), 
because it was worth $1,250.79 to learn that EOTT probably will not have to 
provide any documents that are responsive to this subpoena.  However, until 
someone can convince me that the DOJ is actually interested in some EOTT 
transactions, I will not advise EOTT to contribute more than 5% to this 
effort in the future.  If we cannot agree on an allocation to EOTT that is 
less than 5%, then EOTT will need to make separate arrangements with respect 
to the minimal representation that it will apparently require with respect to 
this matter.

Of course, should circumstances change such that EOTT becomes a focus of this 
investigation, then we would be willing to pay a greater share of these legal 
fees.  Currently, however, EOTT transactions do not appear to be of interest 
to the DOJ, and EOTT should not be allocated 25% of the legal fees associated 
with responses by other Enron affiliates to this subpoena.

Please call me next week so that we may discuss EOTT's participation in this 
matter.

Britt Davis@ENRON
06/09/99 10:09 AM
 I have received a copy of a V&E invoice regarding the above-referenced case 
in the total amount of $5,003.17, which is split equally among Enron Corp., 
EOG, ECT, and EOTT, pursuant to the agreement of those parties.  Let me know 
which of you need a copy of that invoice.  Many thanks.

        B.K.D.

Pay it.

Why not alternate between SG and Fulbright. Flip a coin to see who goes 
first.

It is nice to see that Pat Oxford came through again. The real question is 
:did Pat not support Bruce or does he have plenty of access but no influence 
w/ the future president. Maybe this says alot for Bush. He thinks Pat is as 
much of a cartoon character as we do and has no reason to  take him 
seriously. Wouldn't that be refreshing. You need to get the real scoop before 
lunch on Tuesday w/ Ileana.

The Perd is a problem because it cost $10,000 per year to maintain. I guess 
Mom is (justifiably) tired of paying this when it has been used twice in six 
months. There is really nothing more to it than that. When we1) all get a 
little older and our kids can play unsupervised,2) are less busy and3) have 
our spiritual leader back in the land of the round eye, then we will use it 
alot more. No one is seriosly considering selling the joint, save 
Yvonne.                                                                       
                              

I can probably take off two weeks in August next year to do something stupid 
w/ you. July and June are bad because Julie will be in Montissori training 
school in Austin. We should do something bold, exciting--not Colorado  or 
Calif. How about Canada or Alaska.

I never heard from him.

The attachment is wrong

Richard,

I spoke with Leroy Lambert re Transammonia today.  He has not yet received 
the packet of information which you sent up to him, but if he doesn't receive 
it by Monday  he will call me and I will FedEx a copy to him.  Our answer 
date is July 6.  New York requires federal court style answers.  I have a 
meeting scheduled with Kim Godfrey at 11:30 am, Monday, June 28.  Please feel 
free to attend, if you would like.  I plan to e-mail a draft answer to Leroy 
by Wednesday, which he will check to make sure I have followed New York 
procedure & style and will then file before the end of next week.  I'll keep 
you advised of events as they occur.  Thanks.

Bonnie

It looks fine.

The list should be eliminated. Just provide that the parties should mutually 
agree on an arbitrator, who must be a Delaware corporate atty.

This will confirm that HPL wants a jury trial. Sorry I did not get back to 
you sooner. 

Yes. The position is still open. If you have a resume, please send it. 

The revised letter is fine. Do we want to outline the damages we have 
suffered------ ie developement cost. If so, do it in a general way

I think the list is unworkable because it requires us to do due diligence on 
all the attys on the list--a daunting task. The suggestion of outlining 
several firms is a good compromise.

Lets meet Monday at 9:30

The arbitation provision looks good.

The KN matter has been settled.

Memorandum

Enron's performance has been exceptional.  This performance is reflected in=

our stock price, in the recognition we receive in the media and financial=

communities, and, most importantly, in the enthusiasm of our people.  It ha=

been clear to us for some time that we are driving fundamental change in th=

can be positioned for even greater growth.  A =01&new economy=018 is emergi=

combine the operations of these businesses into a cohesive organization tha=

will ensure we realize the growth we foresee in all our businesses.

To this end, we are initiating a number of organization and staffing change=

in these businesses and related changes in the Enron Office of the Chairman=

in Corporate Staff groups, and in a number of management/personnel=20

on Enron's Board of Directors.

Redefined Business Units

ECT, ECM, EI, EES, and ECI will be regrouped into eight regions/businesses=
=20
and five global functions.  Each region/business will be operated as an=20
independent entity but will coordinate staffing, career paths, compensation=
=20
and performance review across all units.  Each global function will provide=

its specialized expertise across all regions/businesses.  Included in these=

functions is a new technology function, which will focus on information=20

I am OK (but reluctantly) with the settlement.

This is the judge in the Beeson case. Although I am not that fond of Link, I 
think it would be prudent to support him finacially. I suggest $500-$1000. Of 
course he will want more after the primary.

There is no litigation reason why this contract cannot be terminated as 
outlined in your email.

I am not sure about the purpose of this letter. The better response in my 
mind would be to have a process server arrive at their door. If we do send 
them a letter, and I leave that to you, we need to have already filed the 
petition. Then we can attach a file-stamped copy to the letter.

Pay it. Have a nice time.

The Wauna and Halsey PPA's with Ft. James have been cancelled. Sorry for the 
delay.

Dude--- There has been a change in plans. I am arriving on the same day(this 
Sunday) but I have to leave the following Sunday( the 25th) Let me Know your 
plans.

How long is this going to last?

Of all the weekends---Doug's and our family are both going this weekend.

Never mind the previous message. I have no objections.

She did not recieve an offer. Hope all is well.

Great job----I've got about 45 more for you.

I have no changes.

We kicked their ass.

Please let me know of anything other than Grynberg

Richard,
As I mentioned in my phone mail message to you, we are compiling info on the 
above-referenced entities in connection with a due diligence request by a 
potential purchaser. The prospective purchaser has requested information on 
the entities' litigation, whether complete, existing or pending including any 
eminent domain proceedings and insurance litigation. Could you let me know as 
soon as possible if you can provide me that information. The goal is to have 
all requested information in the data room early next week . 

Thank you,
Sandi
ext. 35465

I approve.

Welcome back. Do we need to set up a meeting to discuss the tortious 
interference question we talked about before you left?

Other than Grynberg, the only active case that involves the above-named 
entities is the Enterprise Products case, in which Enron Storage Company is a 
defendant.  My understanding is that that case has settled, but the 
documentation is not yet complete.  We have recently settled the Reeves, 
Poirier and Fontenot cases in which Louisiana Resources was a defendant, and 
those matters are now closed.

Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks.

fyi

Sounds great--   but there aren't "provinces" in UK; and didn't she murder
some kid in Massachusetts?

>>> "scooper@bracepatt.com" 08/02/99 02:32pm >>>
I have a friend here from the UK who came to this county with a British
family as a nanny for their two girls.  She was told this weekend that
due to some financial difficulties they would no longer be able to continue
her employment.  She does not wish to return to England at this time and
is seeking to find another position with a family here ASAP.  The family
she is currently with would recommend her highly.  Her name is Elizabeth
Nugent and she comes from a very good family in northern England. (Her
father is governor of a province there.)   She is university educated in
child care and elementary education.  She is also NVQ (National
Vocational Qualification) Level 3 qualified and has taught in both the
private and public systems there in England.  She is twenty four years
old.  She has excellent references and letters of recommendation.  If you
or someone you know is seeking a well qualified British nanny please
contact me at (713) 221-1361 for more information.  Thank you.

My litigation description looks fine.

What about Tuesday, Aug. 10th or Friday, Aug. 13th?

For your review and comment.

Attached is the revised document.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
- -  Seeking Advice of Counsel - - 

Attached is a draft public statement for your review and comment.  

The groundrules for using these statements are as follows:

All press inquiries should be directed to Eric Thode.

We will use the more "basic statement" unless press inquiries are specific 
and informed by knowledgeable industry participants.

We will use only those parts of the more detailed statement which are 
necessary.

The document begins with a background piece to briefly educate Enron 
personnel who may not be aware of Project Stanley but may be called upon to 
respond to regulators' or customers' inquiries.

Aleck - - please get Seabrou's help filling in the blanks.

Richard - - feel free to forward to outside counsel as you see fit.

 ( REVISED VERSION)

I reviewed the release and it looks good. Another victory.

We did get the money. Thanks. I asked Linda Guinn to look into the misc. 
bills when we recieved it several months ago. I can't remember what we 
decided but I will check with her again and get back to you.

   

I sent a letter last week enclosing a $100,000 check as reimbursement of
an overpayment.  Did you get it?

I should have asked whether we could apply $9,563.84 of it to the old
"counseling" bills I have never been able to get paid.  Recall I went
through those and figured out which unit, etc. they applied to.  Some
were re the Sports Authority, some were re emplyment contracts, etc.
They still haven't ever been paid.  It would be nice to clean this up too. 
Thanks.

I have attached the proposed letter to Larry Taylor.  Please let me know if 
you want to make any changes.

ok

We may be suing them.

I have attached the proposed letter to send to the brokers.  Please let me 
know if you have any changes.  Otherwise, we will send.

Richard Sanders has asked me to set up a meeting regarding the above 
referenced.  The following participants are:

Lisa Mellencamp
Mark Peterson
John Hopley
John Enerson
Richard Sanders

It looks as though, this Friday, Aug. 13. at 2:00 will be a good time for 
everyone.  Please let me know if this time is convenient for you.  The 
location will be 38C1.  (I tried to contact you by phone today, but your 
extension 31406 was forwarded to a non working number).

My extension is 39402, if you wish to call me.

Thanks
Twanda

Yes. I invited Michelle Cash. I have a meeting w/ Skip at 11:00 at B&P. I

Sept 13 is good.

Hi,

We can not agree to the modifications. However, we can agree to exclusive
jurisdiction in New York.  Pls. let me know if that will work for you.
Leaving jurisdiction and venue open is not an option.

Donna attached is a red-line version of the NDA with my one comment in
Section
4(f).  Our corporate policy does not allow us to submit to exclusive
jurisdiction.  Please call me or e-mail me upon your review.  Thanks.

Robin, sorry this is so late, my mail was down most of Friday.

Donna

 - Microsoft redlined.doc

well hello there brothermen and sisterwoman.  it sure seems as if a few
moons have passed since we tickled the keyboard and thought about all y'all
for a spell, and that is not how it ought to be.  so stop your grinnin' and
drop your linen (not sure what that means but i dig it) and let us repair to
the chat room.

started a new job just last week and by all means it is a Godsend.
(blasphemous?)  would that i had found this school a couple of years back,
as it is well-run and full of good folks.  by the latter i mean folks who
are here for the long run or at least a good while, and not fresh off the
boat.  perhaps the best aspect of it is a 25 hr workweek, while the most
abominable is twofold:  i gots to sport a nametag and a wristwatch, and i
reckon the former is the lesser evil even though it is as goofy as Bill
Morris.  the only times i have voluntarily donned a watch were deb parties
back in the day - got a black running watch to go with the tux and showed it
off something fierce.  back in the idol-worship days of namu and ricardo and
stevo.

at any rate, that is the good news and i can feel y'all waiting with bated
breath for the bad stuff.  here goes:  last month had a weeklong hiking trip
to the japanese alps - a big ol' hunk of honshu virtually unknown and
unexplored by the japanese as they cordoned it off as an abode for their
shinto psuedo-deities - planned and set off with a native lady friend guide.
  on our first day of hiking she sees fit to slip off a log bridge and
faceplant some two meters down onto a rock with nary a limb or digit to
break the fall.  can you say ouch?   she couldn't - knocked out cold with a
visibly growing pool of blood about her noggin and limbs splayed in a most
unnatural Deliverance-type manner.

enter the hero rolland, you say?  well not really.  ran over there and did
all the things one knows not to do to a potential head/neck injury and
checked her out.  skull was not in pieces and after cleaning up the mess we
discovered a smashed face instead.  had to hike back several kilometers to a
hut and thence to an ambulance.  hospital revealed a broken nose, severely
lacerated lips and two teeth knocked out.  poor girl, hey?  but hey - i was
the one escorting leon spinks back to osaka on the train with alpine dreams

what is the bottom line, you ask?  as always:  better her than me!
that was probably more than y'all wanted to know about that, but it really
spooked me  - even more than being privy to the intimate details of the
condition of susan's overworked nipple.  how is that nipple, susan?

and that was a good move blowing off elizabeth for emily, y'all.

and concerning kudos, how about our basque following in my very own
ubersuccesful footsteps and putting her nose to the grindstone to become a
teacher?  good on you!  just the thought of it makes us want to jump for
joy, get some oxygen and repeat "oh happy day" over and over.  and it brings
us to take a moment and reflect about our various occupations and their
contributions to society, which could well be graded as follows:

1. John (the Healer):  the guy actually saves lives, a tough act to top.
2. Julie (the Developer):  enables young people - aka the future - to form
their little craniums and warns them against going to law school.
3. Doug (the Facilitator):  helps doctors help patients.
4. Moi (the Ambassador):  doing my part to further international
understanding by means of instruction and exchanges of culture as well as
bodily fluids.
5. Stevo (the Wheeler-Dealer): not really sure what he does, but a reliable
and consistent contributor to the national GNP.  also sires chilluns easy on
the eye, so gets an honorable mention for that.
6. Danna, Susan, Jean Helen, Yvonne (the Mamas):  doing a guten job but for
the purposes of this list, y'all represent neutrality.
7. Maury (the Beltway Insider):  'nuff said.  only your professed desire to
escape and recover some semblence of sanity puts you above
8. Richard (the Suit):  doesn't chase ambulances but as Enron is a big mofo
company, you can bet that he is an integral part of the energy-procuring
wing of the military-industrial complex, and as such is one of Them.
probably knows who killed JFK and is rumored to be the Grand Poobah of the
Masonic Lodge.  the list goes on, but then we come to....
9. Camille (the Investor Extraordinaire):  not exactly a negative
contribution to society, but still sold crystal and brazos riverfront
property.  lost moi a whole heap of cashish, so brings up the bottom.

on the whole a rather notable family, more inclined to give than to take for
the most part.  almost chokes us up to think about it.  truth be known i
have been thinking about y'all as of late and might be close to setting a
date to come on back to hallowed soil.  no reason to set any dates as chisel
is far from stone at this point, but it shan't be too long methinks.

john the eldest and danna the nappiest, y'all should have received letters
by now.  let us know if that is not the case.

well i just scrolled up and found to my dismay this is not as funny as i had
intended.  oh well.  it is better than nothing - i think - as nothing (in
regard to correspondence) is something with which i am well acquainted.
(exception: stevo!)  someone give a holler -

hope all y'all are well and lording over all you survey in your pure
unadulterated Aryan splendour.  i remain

chillin', never illin'

Wollschlager Team:
I took depositions Monday and Tuesday of Wollschlager's expert, David
Cotner, and the two pumpers, Royce and Devon Creager (Father / son
team).  Cotner did nothing but plug numbers into spreadsheets for
Wollschlager, and did not apply any of his engineering or gas contract
expertise to his analysis.  He did not  analyze the contract, amendments
or the dealings between the parties (such as price amendments,
Panhandle program releases, etc.), for purposes of his damage
calculations.  He did not evaluate the true delivery capacity of the well,
but relied totally on Wollschlager's assessment.  He admitted that he would 
not be comfortable submitting the calculations
he performed to a court of law as a valid damages claim, because he
has not reviewed the contract to see what the pricing, take-or-pay,
credits, force-majeure, etc. provisions are, and he agreed that those
types of issues must be included to present a valid contract damages
claim.  We are drafting a motion to exclude his testimony and
calculations.

Royce Creager (mid-late 60's) was the pumper who pumped the well in
1983 when the "event" occurred.  He remembered driving up to the well
the morning after the equipment failure (we're not calling it a blowout - it
was a failure of the operator's equipment).  He noticed something
strange, and then realized that the "stack-pack" (heater and separation
equipment) was not there.  He first thought someone must have stolen it,
and then he saw the broken flowline, pointing up in the air, and 
 of the
"stack pack" about 200 ft. away in one direction, and the other half of the
equipment about 200 ft. away in the other direction!  He does not
remember any gas flowing out of the flowline, and he's sure he would
remember it if the gas had been flowing to the atmosphere.  (Logical
conclusion:  when the equipment failed and blew up, the emergency
shut-down valve on the wellhead did what it was supposed to, and shut
the well in, to prevent any damage to the wellbore or waste of gas, by
shutting off the flow of gas.)

He has absolutely no recollection of the well being shut in prior to the
failure, and no recollection of Intratex's rate requests in general.  He
agreed that it is the operator's (his) responsibility to carefully monitor the
flow of gas from a well being brought back on-line after it has been
shut-in, to make sure no damage occurs.

His son, Devon Creager, has been  pumping the well since early 1985,
and generally has no knowledge or memory of any facts relevant to the
case.  However, he does not know of anything unusual about the well's
production since that time, except that it has gradually declined in
production, which is what he would expect with any gas well.

Wollschlager's deposition is scheduled for September 14.

I am contacting Harper Estes today, to get possible dates for the elusive
mediation.  Judge Gilles called me today (after talking to Morgan) to see if
we needed his help to get a mediation scheduled.  I thanked him and told
him I thought we would be able to schedule a mutually agreeable date,
but told him we may call him next week if we needed him to "help" us.

Stay tuned . . . Andy Taylor

 Employees bid for bankrupt mill

Friday, 3 September, 8:30 p.m.
NIAGARA FALLS, Ont. (CP)

FORMER EMPLOYEES of bankrupt Gallaher Thorold Papers said Friday they
have filed a letter of intent to buy the paper mill. Details of the bid
were not immediately available. "We have developed employee ownership as
a viable alternative in several other locations," Cec Makowski,
vice-president of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of
Canada, said in a release.

The union said it has led successful employee ownership bids at Ontario
paper mills in Kapuskasing, Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie.

A letter of intent was sent to the receiver, Ernst and Young, with the
support of the employee group, the management group and the
International Union of Operating Engineers.

The union represented most of the mill's 310 workers, who were laid off
when the Thorold plant shut down May 25.

The mill, which produced a variety of paper products including
envelopes, wallpaper and consumer packaging, has not operated since and
was put into receivership in June. It can make products using 100 per
cent recycled paper.

Does this mean you have heard from Rocky? Dont give up hope yet--- there 
might be a position not under Rick Shapiro(wishfully thinking)

I do know them. Great folks. The lawyer for the plaintiffs--Patricia whatever 
is an awful person. If it is not a bench trial i'll tell you more.

The plaintiffs atty--Patricia Whatever has been against me in two cases. She 
sued GroupMac in one case and Enron in another. One day I'm sitting at the 
house on Tosca when the phone rings. Its her. She must have seen my name on a 
list of residents. She starts pumping me for info:Have you seen this dog on 
the loose in the area before. Now mind you when I was younger,slimmer and 
with less kids, I was in the yard all the time. I knew the stray dogs. I told 
her I had never seen their dog loose before and in fact I didn't know they 
had a dog. Needless to say I never heard from her again.

Gentlemen - two items.

First, HPL has been sued (filed but not served) in a very minor right-of-way 
matter.  It is so minor I expect it can be resolved before plaintiff ever 
serves.  What type of information/involvement, if any,  would you like to see 
on this matter?

Second, the big picture.  Since Mr. Hammer has moved on to better hunting and 
fishing grounds, I now have overall responsibility of the GPG Law Operations 
group.  What types of information/involvement would you like to see on any 
HPL litigation that would be handled by operations?  We will, of course, keep 
Mr. Schneider well informed since he is the client.  

Thoughts??

thanks mark.  reason i asked this morning is that richard sanders needs to 
pay to colonial by tomorrow any balances legitimately due colonial by enron.  
IF we withheld the usd 250k (tomas?) and lost the 161 then we need to (a) 
verify by all enclosed that we owe them (250-161) usd 89k and tell richard 
how we pay them (check or transfer or whatever).  pls advise today.

 (3) Yes,  we loss $161 K on the Florida for the Colonial - PGE Sale for the 
99,000 barrels we bought from Colonial.     Mark      

Dale Snyder
09/13/99 10:34 AM
it looks as though we overwithheld about usd 80k that is now due colonial

(1) against their invoice to us of usd 1,089,379.26 i believe we paid them 
usd 839,379.26 shortpaying them usd 250k exactly correct Tomas?

(2) we sent colonial documentation (feb 12, 1999 fax from Tomas) showing that 
we estimated that they  owed us usd 132,752.92 for the barging on the first 
(and subsequently only) lifting from colonial to pge correct Tomas?

(3) however we subsequently found  that we incurred usd 161,406.59 in total 
costs as evidenced by leskowitz's spreadsheet dtd 8/23/99 right Mark?

Chad, Mark, Tomas: can you pls confirm that we would therefore owe Colonial 
usd 88,590 correct?

Richard, want to get together on this next week?

I am in an arbitration all week. Can you get together with the appropriate 
person(s) at PGE to find out about the hiring of Richard Carroll and report 
back?

On Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.  
I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.  It was our belief that  
FJ did not act in good faith in "expeditiously and fairly evaluating" all of 
Enron's energy proposals.  Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue 
from the commodity (gas & coal) deals that were executed.  I argued that 
commodity deals were never the "intent" of the Alliance as outlined in the 
"Objectives of the Parties."  I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement 
to do commodity deals.

Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of "substantial assets" as it 
related to the asset sale.  I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us 
because that was where we had a significant energy project.  It was also 
substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas 
consumption.  FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before 
informing us the mill would be sold.  I told Phil this is not how Alliance 
partners treat each other. 
I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the 
situation.  His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to 
continue with it "as is."  My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.

I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to 
their counsel Greg Chaffee.

Next Steps:

I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our 
case to present to the mediator.  Rather than just show the list of potential 
deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case 
to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the 
value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to 
do it themselves).  This should go a long way to proving "bad faith".  

I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with 
the entire project list and the various "reasons" FJ chose not to do the 
projects.

Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute 
within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.  The parties are 
to meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the 
mediator.  Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take 
place anytime between now and November 10.

Let me know if you have questions.

Send me both Motions for SJ. Thanks.

This is to advise you that there are two nationwide private natural gas
royalty
cases that have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas before Judge
Hannah.
Neither lists Enron Corp or any of its subsidiaries as a defendant.  Both
cases
are class actions.  Neither is a Qui Tam action.  The allegations are
similar to
those in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.

The first, in Civil Action 9:99cv255, was filed September 20, 1999.  The
plaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.  The defendants are Mobil
Oil
Corporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing
Southeast,
Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas & New Mexico, Inc. and Mobil
Exploration and Producing U.S.

The second, Civil Action 9:00cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.  The plaintiffs
are
Melanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, WI.
The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration & Production
Company,
Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading Company.

Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing the
plaintiffs in both cases.  Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming & Asso. of
Houston,
signed the Stirman complaint.

Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website at
www.edtx.uscourts.gov.  Enter the site and look under "Frequently Requested
Cases".  You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.

Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsaker
told
me that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had  been dropped as
defendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities were
named
in  Original and First Original Amended Complaints),  both are again named
as
defendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed on June
13,
2000.    The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the plaintiffs, had a
conflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron and EOG to
preserve
the case.  That conflict has now been resolved.  The June 13 complaint is
not
yet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.

If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843.

It looks fine to me.

I've seen it and it still looks good to me

Attached is the weekly litigation report.

Fine. What are the court costs?

I have attached a memo from Don Black regarding his meeting with Duke 
yesterday. As you will note,this memo outlines the factual differences 
between the parties. The legal issue is one straight out of first year 
Contracts class: Was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding 
contract? When I first looked at this I was somewhat concerned. In response 
to an email from Duke describing a particular index pricing, Julian responded 
simply "I agree." But after talking to Don, Greg Whalley ,reviewing all the 
email correspondence, and, most importantly, listening to the trader tapes, I 
am convinced that Julian never agreed to the index that Duke is alleging. In 
other words I think we can make a good argument to get around  the damaging " 
I agree" email. It is clear that Duke's trader didn't, and probably still 
doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email. The Master Agreement 
provides for arbitration in Houston with three arbitrators, one of whom must 
have 8 years of experience in derivatives. I'll take my chances with that 
kind of panel. I estimate our liklihood of prevailing is in the 70-80% range. 
Let me know if you need anything further.
Don Black@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
10/05/99 05:46 PM
Julian Poole and I attended at meeting at our office with Erik Ludtke and Amy 
Statler of Duke Intl. today.  We reviewed the tapes and the emails, and they 
are hanging their hat on the fact that the only monomic price published by 
Cammesa is the index to which they are referring.   Our answer to that claim 
is that they defined the trade as a 7 by 24 flat load, when the index they 
are trying to use is a demand weighted index.  Also, in the tape, immediately 
following the word "monomic" by Amy, is a definitional description; "capacity 
plus energy".   Cammesa states that there is no where that you can find the 
definition of the word monomic in their library.  We believe that monomic 
means the hourly price plus the capacity payment for peak hours.

Lastly, the index she wants to use is a monthly number, published only once a 
month, but she states in her  "let's add" email that she would like it to "be 
the monthly average of the monomic spot price published by Cammesa"  I asked 
her how do you calculate the monthly average of a number that is published 
once a month.  I related to her that the logic did not follow.  She responded 
with a forgettable comment.

We had a long discussion about whether or not a trade had occurred.  I 
explained to them that legally, the transaction is not closed until the deal 
is closed by an authorized ECT trader in Houston. Also, we explained the 
closure process to them multiple times.   We never admitted to a trade.

They think that they caught Julian.  I told them that if they had been 
clearer in their definition of their desired index, I would feel a "trader's 
obligation" to follow-thru with the process, but if they wanted to use the 
"Precio Medio Monomico as Published by the Cammesa in the section of The 
Boletin entitled Los Resultados Economicos for the applicable months"   or  
the "Precio Medio En El Mes, Monomico, published in the Informe Mensual under 
the heading Precio de la Energia and Monomico", they should have just said it.

They want $500,000 in LD's, or they will let us honor the trade and flip it 
out to them at $22.50 for a MTM loss of $308,000.  Our estimate is that the 
alleged trade is about $220,000 out of the money at present.

Our decision is to allow this matter to take its course.  Erik is going to 
decide what he wants to do, and will inform me.  If he wants to pursue the 
matter, he will refer the matter to Bruce of Duke Intl.

If anyone has any instructions as to how we should proceed, please let us 
know.

For future reference, the traders here have been informed to not agree to 
things in an email, even if they are agreeing to the clarification of an 
outline of a deal clearly marked "INDICATION".  Lesson learned.

I am good for $25.

Actually if this case goes to arbitration, it will be in Houston. Know any 
good lawyers?

Kirsten,

As I mentioned to you this morning by phone, we are advised that Brazos 
Electric
Power Cooperative filed a cert. petition on Friday with respect to the  Fifth
Circuit decision in the QF case.  We will send the papers to you (or to 
whomever
Enron or Ponderosa designates) when they come in.

I believe that someone in our D.C. office has informed the Solicitor General's
office that we no longer represent the partnership.  However, I don't think it
will not be necessary for us to file a withdrawal as counsel for the 
partnership
since the cert petition starts a new proceeding.

Regards,

Bart

Mike Diamond (for PaineWeber) has negotiated an agreement with Mike Swartz
that none of the defendants need respond to the pending discovery at this
time.  We will be having further discussions.  I think some of the
defendants "demurred" today rather than answering.  A demurrer is roughly
the state-court equivalent of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

As you know, Glidden filed a motion for stay of proceedings today.
Scarlett is working on an initial draft of a response.  I will be in
Austin tomorrow at Graves Dougherty, but she will fax the draft to me
there, I will edit it and we will get something over for you to look at
tomorrow evening.

As we anticipated, what prompted this was our insistence on the
appointment of the third appraiser--so there is no need to reevaluate
our strategy at this stage.  We will simply proceed as planned to file a
response in opposition to a stay of the appraisal proceeding and,
simultaneously, a plea in abatement/motion for stay asking the judge to
stay Intrust's common law claims pending the resolution of the appraisal
proceeding.

I will call you to check in with you about mid-day to get your thoughts.
I will also have my cell phone with me, (713) 249-2677, and you can
reach me there if need be.

Thanks,

KP

P.S. - Could I trouble you to forward this on to Gene Humphrey and Mark
Lay?  I'd like for them to know the drafting schedule, but I don't have

No need to call. My thoughts are: defeat his motion to stay,win our motion to 
stay.

I guess we will know on Tues.

We are going around and around with Sitler's attorney about the appointment

 CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT:  SUPREME COURT ORDERS BRIEFING ON CONSTITUTIONALITY 
OF QUI TAM ENFORCEMENT

 In a surprise announcement, the Supreme Court yesterday indicated that it 
will determine this term whether a private individual (known as a"relator") 
who files a qui tam False Claims Act cases has standing to bring such a case.

 In an FCA case already fully briefed and ready for argument on November 29,  
Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel Stevens, No. 
98-1828, the court had granted certiorari to determine two issues:  (1)  
whether states have immunity under the Eleventh Amendment from FCA suits 
brought by qui tam relators, and  (2) whether states are "persons" subject to 
FCA liability.  Yesterday,  the Supreme Court issued an order
instructing the parties to file, by November 30, additional briefs on the qui 
tam relator's standing to bring an FCA suit.  A panel of the Fifth Circuit 
Court of Appeals recently issued an opinion declaring qui tam enforcement 
unconstitutional, a ruling that would have created a conflict among the 
circuits.  See, United States ex rel. Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 
No. 97-20948, 1999 WL 1034216  (5th Cir. Nov 15, 1999), discussed in 
FraudMail Alertc 11-15-99 and FraudMail Alert No. 99-11-18.  In a split 
decision, the Fifth Circuit panel ruled  that when the government declines 
intervention, qui tam enforcement of the FCA violates the Take Care Clause of 
the Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine.  However, that ruling 
was vacated and the Riley case is now before the full Fifth Circuit for en 
banc review.

 The constitutionality of qui tam enforcement has been hotly debated since 
the watershed amendments to the False Claims Act in 1986 significantly 
expanded the rights and powers of qui tam relators.  Every district court to
consider the issue, and five (5) courts of appeals, had concluded that qui 
tam enforcement is constitutional, albeit on conflicting (and sometimes 
inexplicable) grounds.  Judge Hoyt's ruling in Riley was the first district 
court opinion holding that  qui tam enforcement is unconstitutional.  The
District Court in Riley concluded that the qui tam relator lacked standing to 
sue under the FCA because he had suffered no injury in fact.  See Riley v. 
St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 982 F. Supp. 1261 (S.D. Tex 1997).  The
Fifth Circuit panel affirmed this ruling, but on different constitutional 
grounds.  It was hoped that on rehearing en banc the Fifth Circuit would also 
find the qui tam provisions unconstitutional, and would create a conflict in 
the circuits to require Supreme Court review of this constitutional issue. 
The Supreme Court's order yesterday in the Stevens
case indicates that the Court intends to expedite that consideration and 
resolve at least the standing issue this term.

 One final note:  while it is surprising that the constitutional issue would 
be raised by the Court at such a late date, the issue is not new to the 
Stevens case.  In the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Stevens, 
162 F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 1999), Judge Jack B. Weinstein, sitting by
designation, issued a lengthy dissent from the panel decision both on the 
issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity and on the separation of powers and 
standing issues even though the Second Circuit had ruled in 1993 that qui tam 
enforcement was constitutional.  See, U.S. ex rel. Kreindler & Kreindler v. 
United Technologies Corp., 985 F. 2d 1148 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 113 S. Ct. 
2962 (1993).  And, of course, it is not unusual for the court to question 
standing at any time.

Don - the draft looks good. My only thought is that we may not need to
require that the posted copies be file stamped. It seems to me that this
requirement could cause some delay. Moreover, the hard copies people get
by ordinary service are not file stamped. Given that my client is
continuing to incur copying costs, I ask that you  try to get this
proposal circulated as quickly as possible. Thanks- Barrett

Clay, Jay and Barrett,
      The three of you strike me as the best choices to give me feedback
on the attached draft of informal procedures I recommend we propose
to kansas JDT members.   I would appreciate your review and
suggestions.

We wrote him a letter rejecting his offer of $250,000 and asked for $1 
million. It might be a good idea for you to call him and feel him out. We 
would certainly take less than $1 million. What do you think?

As we discussed.

Miles Cohn <mcohn@hou-law.com> on 11/23/99 10:52:07 AM
Britt and Bonnie:

As I discussed with Britt this morning, I represent Furlow Services, Inc., 
which is owed substantial sums under two general construction contracts with 
Ecogas Corp., one in Dallas (the McCommas Landfill) and the other in San 
Antonio (Nelson Gardens Landfill).  (There are two "Ecogas Corp."s, one a 
Texas corp. and one a Delaware corp. It appears that Furlow's contracts are 
with the Delaware corporation, but I have not been able to fully verify that.)

Tom Hall, the general cousel of Ecogas (512/347-1441), tells us, in general 
terms, that Ecogas has been acquired by Enron (ECT, I think) and that we will 
get paid when Enron puts up the money.  Mr. Hall has mentioned that his 
contact at Enron is John Lambert.  I called Mr. Lambert yesterday, but have 
not yet received a response. Mr. Hall also disputes our invoices, although we 
have not been able to get him to set out his disputes in any detail.

I have been corresponding with Mr. Hall, trying to get this worked out, since 
August of this year, and we are now at an impasse.  Furlow Services has filed 
mechanic's liens and desires to file suit.  I have prepared lawsuits for 
recovery of the Furlow accounts on the two projects and to foreclose its 
liens on those projects.

There are two reasons why I am contacting you before filing the lawsuits:

     1.  I need to verify what (if any) relationship there is between Ecogas 
and Enron.  Since I have represented other Enron subsidiaries, and would like 
to continue to do so, I will not file any lawsuit against Enron or any of its 
subsidiaries.  If we confirm that Ecogas really is an Enron subsidiary, 
whether direct or indirect, then I will obtain new counsel for Furlow 
Services on this dispute.

     2.  Since Enron regularly pays its bills, something doesn't seem right 
about this entire scenario if Enron has in fact acquired Ecogas.  If Enron 
does have responsibility for Ecogas' construction costs, perhaps this all can 
be worked out in a meeting rather than a lawsuit.  If I can facilitate 
working this out, and if both Furlow and Enron consent to my continuing to 
play a role in settlement discussions, I would continue to represent Furlow 
solely for purposes of settlement discussions.

     I sincerely appreciate your help on this matter.  I know it is hard to 
get anything done this week, and I will be leaving this afternoon for the 
Thanksgiving holiday.  No lawsuits will be filed this week, and I will follow 
up with you next week before taking any action.  In the meantime, thanks 
again and have a great holiday!

Coie uses her, as do (it turns out) PGE and ECI.  She also does work for 
Intel.  Here is her information:

 Green and Associates
 2701 NW Vaughn Street, Suite 450
 Portland, OR   97210

 (503)224-9601

Hope this is helpful.  Did you get my message about Andy Wu?

Janet Moore tells me that he could go back to EI if he wanted, but he doesn't 
want to travel. Should we at least talk to him? Mark--- have you found out 
anything about his reputation

Ok to talk to him, I just don't want to get his expectations up.  Mark

Sean and I talked through the Mid-C control area abuse (Puget and WWP's 
refusal to honor Mid-C sales not sunk at Mid-C) with Dan Watkiss of Bracewell 
Patterson.  After "sinking" his mind into the facts, Dan was of the view that 
a two pronged legal approach could be taken:   1.  take one of our apparently 
frequent direct purchases  from Puget at Mid-C as  a test case and when Puget 
refuses to honor the schedule which requires it to be sunk at COB, sue them 
in a state court,  and 2.  bring a complaint against Puget at Ferc allegding 
conduct in breach of the Federal Power Act.    There is enough wrong about 
this situation to cause Dan to say that both actions were potentially 
available.    The real issue now is,  do we want to disrupt our business 
relationship with Puget and WWP by taking either or both of these actions?  
Let's discuss this, and Richard,  I apologize for not getting to you with 
this already, but will call you and discuss it right away.----cgy 

Enron Europe has decided to pursue this claim. How involved would you like me

PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY - CLIENT COMMUNICATION  : CONFIDENTIAL  

Mark / Dan / John

As you are aware , earlier this year , we served formal notices of two 
potential warranty claims ( re. the Halochems. closure and the DuPont reduced 
steam-take ) on ICI , as required by the Sale of Business Agreement . We have 
subsequently prepared a detailed draft analysis and costing of our claims 
(the "Particulars of Claim") which has been served on ICI's lawyers , Herbert 
Smith . They have come back with some requests for supporting documentation 
which we are currently dealing with.

The Sale of Business Agreement requires us , unless ICI agree to settle which 
seems highly unlikely at this stage , to issue formal court proceedings 
against ICI before 21 November in respect of the Halochems. claim and before 
17 December in respect of DuPont  . We wish to deal with the two claims 
together and , accordingly , it is proposed that we issue proceedings , at 
latest , on 16 November . Issue puts us into a formal procedural timetable . 
ICI would have 14 days to reply indicating whether they wish to defend and a 
further 14 days to issue a defence , though this period is generally capable 
of being extended by a further 28 days . The process of discovery , whereby 
each side has the opportunity to examine relevant documentation in the 
possession of the other , would probably begin after 3 months or so . If we 
were to go to full trial , this could be in the second half of next year .

If we don't issue proceedings before the relevant dates , we lose the right 
to bring the relevant claim completely unless ICI has waived the requirement 
that we issue proceedings by these dates , which they have shown no 
inclination to do.The downside of issuing proceedings is that , whilst we are 
entitled to withdraw them at any stage if we decide not to proceed with the 
claims , we would then be liable for much of ICI's legal costs from the date 
of issue to the date of withdrawal .  Our lawyers' view  is that , were we to 
go to full trial and lose , the potential aggregate liability for ETOL's 
legal costs and ICI's legal costs would be between o1 million and o1.5 
million (our current costs are around o70 , 000 ).

In terms of the chances of success of our claims were we to go to full trial 
, I believe  , and am advised , that the DuPont reduced steam-take claim is 
more likely to succeed than the Halochems. shutdown claim . Given the legal 
complexities of contractual warranty claims , I do not think it would be wise 
, at this stage , to be overly confident of success at full trial . However , 
there is certainly , in my view , good potential for achieving a settlement 
with ICI which may involve more than simply a cash payment (eg restructuring 
of key contracts , land deals etc. ) .We do know that , as a matter of 
practice , ICI ignore potential claims unless proceedings have been issued . 
Issue of proceedings should , thus , be viewed primarily , at this stage , as 
a necessary means of getting ICI to the negotiating table . Their costs will 
not ramp up significantly until discovery starts , so we should be ready to 
monitor closely and constantly our prospects in the litigation as against our 
potential exposure should we withdraw or lose .

On the basis of the above , I would recommend that proceedings are issued 
against ICI and would very much welcome your views or comments on this.

Regards.

Jon                                                                    

Please move forward on discovery. Lets force them to the conclusion that 
they  really need to get rid of Enron as a Defendant

Richard: I left a message with Twanda this morning, but I understand you
have been a little busy. On Natole: I called Tom Deen again; his client is
reluctant to dismiss Enron without seeing documents to prove that we don't
have any different records on the commission, and that we in fact did not
know about Natole's involvement.  I'm not sure I follow him, but I told Deen
it sounds  like Natole doesn't want to settle yet.  Our document production
is due a week from this Friday, and Alan Ludwig and Linda Guinn have been
gathering the documents for us to review and respond.  On Calpine: I didn't
get to draft a lawsuit before the Thanksgiving holiday, because Michelle and
Haedicke wanted me to rush a draft complaint against Duke, which I did, but
now that seems to have faltered, since we have yet to hear word that we are
authorized to file it.  I have a lengthy series of depositions that are
underway, but let me know if you want to get together on Calpine or want me
to take action, and I'll make time in the schedule for it.
Best regards,

I have asked Twanda to set up a conference call.
RTellis@milbank.com on 12/10/99 06:27:15 PM
Richard and Linda:  I attended the Demurrer Hearing/Status Conference in the
Farallon case this morning.  Judge Berle sustained the Demurrers, providing
Plaintiffs with twenty days to file an amended complaint.  Steve and I
believe that this twenty-day period provides us with a critical opportunity
to try and persuade Plaintiffs to drop ECT from the lawsuit.  In order to do
so, however, we need to accelerate our fact gathering so that we can
articulate with precision ECT's role, or lack thereof, in the purchase and
sale of the NSM Notes.  While the Offering Memorandum (p. 179) states
generally what Notes were purportedly purchased by ECT and other "initial
purchasers," we must understand (i) what Notes were sold, (ii) to whom and
(iii) by whom.  This requires a discussion with Travis McCullough and, quite
possibly, Kevin McConville.

Steve and I would like to have a call with you early next week regarding the
foregoing.

Thanks,

Gail -

To answer your questions, and being brief in this complicated case, I am
optimistic about the changes of a recovery against charterers' liability
underwriters.

Were we to revive the arbitration and it went to a final hearing on merits, I
rate the chances of success as 60:40 in our favour.  Underwriters have pleaded
the defence of inherent vice in the adjourned arbitration but the burden of
proof is firmly on them.  Further, Minton Treharne & Davies, our experts,
believe that the cargo was borderline on spec. and became off-spec. for
transit-related reasons (which cannot be blamed on the ship).  In our favour, 
we
have the Samarec certificate of quality and one loadport sample ex ship 
showing
the cargo on spec.  Against this is the circumstantial evidence of problems on
other ships and what will be a sustained technical attack on the credibility 
of
the Samarec certificate by a chemistry expert.

My instincts tell me we shall never reach a final hearing.  We will have to
revive the arbitration without doubt, but underwriters in my view have not got
the stomach for a fight.  I think they will try to settle for an agreed 
figure,
and will look to Enron to discount their claim.  We shall claim against them 
on
top of the settlement sum (yet to be paid by you), various costs and
disbursements incurred in defending shipowners' claims.  In my view they were
all reasonably incurred.  Underwriters were given every opportunity to settle
with shipowners but choose to do nothing.  They did not even bother to attend
the mediation.

To answer your queries on fees, the amount we are holding on client account is
approximately USD111,000 (Navigas settlement monies plus refund of arbitration
deposit less paid Clyde & Co. accounts).  Unbilled costs are approximately
o7,000 and unbilled disbursements o25,000.

Regards,
David Best.

Elizabeth,

We have seemed to hit a brick wall in finding out who has monitored the fax 
machine we have discussed on the 31st Floor.  Don Black's assistant, 
Claudette Harvey said no one really collects the faxes and it is used by two 
groups.  Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be 
monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.  We called the 
service number on the fax to see if we could get a "poll" report listing all 
the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has 
memory for the last 10 faxes.  I have called Lucent (the telephone people) 
and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the 
incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Power Cooperative filed a cert. petition on Friday with respect to the  Fifth
Circuit decision in the QF case.  We will send the papers to you (or to 
whomever

I believe that someone in our D.C. office has informed the Solicitor General's
office that we no longer represent the partnership.  However, I don't think it
will not be necessary for us to file a withdrawal as counsel for the 
partnership
since the cert petition starts a new proceeding.

I have just learned of another lawsuit involving CGAS.  This had been
handled by Jud Scheaf and had been dormant for a long time, which is why
neither I nor anyone at the company knew about it.

This is somewhat confusing, so let me try to explain.  The style is
Kilbarger Construction vs Eastland Energy Group, et al.  In the Court of
Common Pleas of Muskingum County, Ohio  Case No. CH96-0311.

CGAS had a lease in Muskingum County.  Eastland Energy had a lease on an
adjoining tract.  Eastland approached CGAS about going together to drill a
well on a unit formed by the two leases.  CGAS agreed.  Eastland was
designated operator.  Eastland hired Kilbarger as the drilling contractor.
Kilbarger drilled the well and it was dry.  Eastland thought Kilbarger
negligently drilled the well, so Eastland only paid Kilbarger half the
drilling cost.  Kilbarger filed a mechanics lien and filed suit against
Eastland for the other half of the drilling costs (approximately $30,000)
and also joined CGAS because of the mechanics lien.  Kilbarger was not
seeking any monetary recovery from CGAS, and the lien is meaningless since
CGAS has since released its lease.  Thus, we have no pending claims from
Kilbarger.

However, in the same case Eastland and CGAS have a claim pending.  During
the drilling of the well, some of the contractors would not work for
Eastland since they did not know Eastland - a new, small producer.  Those
contractors therefore did the work on the well for CGAS, billed CGAS, CGAS
paid those contractors, and CGAS then invoiced Eastland.  Eastland did not
pay and therefore CGAS has a claim in this suit against Eastland for
$7,139.69.  No monetary claim has been made by Eastland against CGAS.

I just learned of this case and have taken over this file from Jud Scheaf.
There is a settlement conference scheduled for December 9 and this case is
set for trial on December 16.  I am hopeful this will be resolved before
trial.  If there are questions, please call.

Does this name sound familiar?
Mike Williams at CIG called today to advise that he received an announcement
from Donald L. Flexner, formerly of Crowell & Moring LLP (DC), that (1) Mr.
Flexner has now joined David Boies' firm, and (2) Boies' firm has changed
its name to Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP.

Mr. Flexner previously rendered anti-trust/other legal services to CIG, and
Mike is exploring whether Flexner's joining Boies' firm creates any basis
for disqualifying Boies, Schiller & Flexner in Quinque.  To this end, Mike
asked that I contact Enron's lawyers to learn whether Flexner has also
represented any Enron entities in the past.

If you know of any representation of Enron entities by Mr. Flexner, please
let either Barrett Reasoner or me know.

Thanks,
Andy Pickens

You will love me after this request........

Richard, we have several form contracts being developed and used in EBS that 
include arbitration provisions.  We thought it might be useful to get your 
thoughts on our current forms to make sure we are consistent with up to date 
arbitration provisions.  Attached are three of our forms for your review.  
Please note that the Professional Services Agreement is a standard consulting 
agreement that we typically use with service providers.  Please call me with 
any questions or comments.

Good job on your conversation. Unless Max wants to pay some nominal amount of 
money to simply get rid of them, I would advise that we do nothing. We could 
write a letter confirming the substance of your conversation and warn them 
not to slander Enron,but I think that might be overkill. 

I forwarded this to Derrick and Haedicke. Why dont you send one out to every 
other GC. Thx.

The interest rate is fine. We do not  agree to "loser pays" attys fees. The 
arbitrator has discretion under AAA rules to award attys fees, so we usually 
leave it open. I would not agree to pay attys fees if someone goes to court 
for some relief outside the arbitration. Please let me know if you have any 
questions

The phone call to Intermesa and Votorantim should emphasize the following 
points:

1. The transaction was never consumated.  We have consistently stated that we 
do not consider the transaction a   "done deal" until final documents are 
executed.

2. We are no longer willing to consider the proposed transaction.  The reason 
is simple:  the market has moved and they failed to act quickly.

3. All markets,pet coke markets in particular, are time sensitive.  Because 
Votorantim has delayed in the execution of final   documents, it accepted the 
risk that, over time, market prices would change and Enron would no longer be 
willing to sign a deal.

4. Again, we never had a final, enforceable deal. Their only claim is that we 
misrepresented to them our willingness to do the deal and therefor they 
didn't pursue negotiations with a third party. Our response is: we never made 
any misrepresetation and it is not reasonable to  rely on our negotiations as 
a basis to forego discussions with third parties when Enron never sent them a 
binding offer.

Richard, I have attached a draft petition in the Calpine matter for your
review. Our preliminary assessment is that the probability of a successful
outcome is low. I am doing further research and will call you tomorrow to
discuss this matter. Thanks. Laura

As requested by Joe Hartsoe, I put in a call to John Flory yesterday.

John called me back today.  He said the view in the PX is that Enron is 
stalling.  I gave him the other side of the story.  He thinks nothing will be 
done until the next Market Monitoring COm meeting later this month (the PX 
web site does not list the date),  He says the matter will likely be 
discussed in Executive Session.  He also believes that the PX wants to meet 
with Enron and isn't likely to do anything publicly until after that meeting.

Unfortunately, from talking to John, the perception at the PX appears to be 
that this matter should be handled like the Chicago Board of Trade where they 
monthly release a list of offenders and what they have done, and nobody 
thinks much about it.  It's routine.  That's the wat they want these to be in 
the future, but they realize that this one -- the first -- will seem much 
bigger than that because it is first.

He said we got stuck because we did something significant and they really 
didn't have any process set up to handle these things.  He said the 
compliance staff has only gotten some real analytical skills as of Nov 
(although he mentioned outside consultants looked at our case).  We also 
aren't being picked on.  Other people are being investigated, but we're 
coming through first.  I asked about utility pressure.  He said he has been 
asked about the investigation by utility people, but doesn't believe it has 
caused any undue pressure on the PX.  He said, if they were being pressured, 
the investigation would have been completed by now.

He said that they don't want to give the matter any more significance than it 
has, but they can't ignore it.  A 3000MW schedule over a 30 MW line just 
can't be ignored, he said.

I didn't ask him for a heads' up on the public release of the letter, but I 
feel I can call him for updates at any time.

I would like to cancel,as long as my RC is not charged. Unless I hear 
otherwise, I will asume this is ok.

yes, I will attend.

Attached is the letter to TVA.

Can you get w/ Staci and take care of this request?
Becky just faxed Larry McBride's December 13 letter to Barrett and me
regarding Blue Dolphin's demands concerning the defense of Black Marlin in
the Quinque litigation.

We assume that no response has been sent to McBride or to Blue Dolphin and
that you want our advice or help in drafting a response.  If so, would you
please send us copies of the applicable documents, which we assume would
include the September 28, 1998 Purchase and Sale Agreement referenced in
McBride's letter.  Thanks.

Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of 
updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with 
regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has 
closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all 
drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document 
retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.  
Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal) 

The requirement that all three arbitrators have 10 years of experience in 
unrealistic. We will be hard pressed to find one. Most arbitrators are 
lawyers.
With respect to the second change, it is not a change we should make. This  
changes the arbitration from a party designate arbitration where one of the 
arbitrators is our advocate, to a totally nuetral panel.

I think we have compiled all the information you requested. Sorry for the 
delay. Please call Linda Guinn at  ext.36104

Doug and Richard,

Is the Perd going to be all work and no play? I'm trying to decide if I'm
going to take Ryan with me. We could leave around 4 PM on Friday. I could
leave much sooner, if I weren't taking him with me (school and all). I
don't think he'll be
much help to what we're doing, but he'd probably have more fun than if he
he
were to stay at home.

So, when do you guys think you'll get there? How long do you think you'll
stay? Are any of your kids going?

John

I can't tell what changes he made. Can you?

letter to Dick Ingersoll.  Please call me with your comments.  We need to

Both Sheila Tweed and I have concluded that Kristopher Wahlers is not a good

Attached is a new draft of the letter to John Pope with all comments 
received.  Dick Ingersoll will send this out to TVA tomorrow.  If you have 
any other additions, please get them to me today.

Britt was going to check with all the Enron GC's. I assume he got no response.

I spoke with Becky Noecker re Great Lakes. It is primarily a Canadian
pipeline transporting Canadian gas to the US. It transports a little
Michigan production but not from federal leases and it does not measure that
gas for royalty purposes. Great Lakes raised this informaly with Figa and
his response was to list many things Great Lakes would have to prove in
order for Grynberg to dismiss. Great Lakes then sent a notice letter for
Rule 11 purposes and Figa dismissed rather than allowing the Rule 11 motion
to be filed.  Becky also asked me what we'd found out about whether Boies
new partner has done any Enron work. Any news on that front?

Your observations on how to fix the problem are right on the money. The other 
thing we should have done is confirm that the broker confirm links the two 
transactions as well.

Have you received all the information you need?

indicates that ECT was to purchase 12,210 units of the B notes.  Thus, it

Richard--

We have agreed to depose Ron Natole on Feb. 18 at 10 a.m., at his lawyer's 
office.  I will copy you on the amended notice we are sending out today.

We have not rescinded our depo notices for the 2 Korean gentlemen, but have 
agreed to reset the dates.  I expect Plaintiff's counsel will de-designate 
these men rather than bring them here for their depos.  The only other notice 
we sent out last week was for the designated expert from the Wood Group -- 
Robert Harrison.  I will attempt to obtain available dates directly from him.

With respect to the depos of Enron personnel, please check with Mike Miller 
and Bob Virgo regarding their availability during the 2 weeks we discussed -- 
Feb. 21 and Feb. 28 -- March 3.  Of course, we will also need a block of time 
in advance of the depos to prepare with the witnesses.  Bill has a trial 
setting the 2nd week (Feb. 28), which may be postponed in the near future.  
If it is not, I can present them for their depos.  Plaintiff's counsel has 
not mentioned any other Enron personnel by name, but has generally requested 
dates for anyone else we may be presenting at trial as a fact witness or 
corporate rep.

The only other name that I recall having potentially significant involvement 
was Dave Marshall, an ECT risk management guy who appears to have had some 
discussions with IBC's Ron Anderson about Enron's requirements with respect 
to repaired/refurbished parts.  Bill believes there may be other Enron 
witnesses, and that Miller and Virgo will know who they are.

We are also working up a list of proposed mediators -- preferably with strong 
commercial litigation experience.  Gary McGowan currently heads the list, but 
I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions you may have.

Lastly, I agree with your suggestion regarding our question as to why the 
Wood Group (Robert Harrision) has appeared on Plaintiff's expert list.  It 
would certainly be helpful to have Miller's thoughts on that subject.

Richard:  Here for your review is the resume of Woody Waters, employed as an
in-house attorney at Texaco in its Burbank, CA offices.  He has been with
Texaco, first in Houston and now in Burbank, since he earned his joint law
degree and MBA in 1990.

Within Texaco, he is a transactional attorney and has two specialties:
First, he supports Texaco Global Gas and Power in all aspects of project
development and finance, in its efforts to develop cogeneration power plants
in domestic and international locations.  Secondly, he has provided legal
counsel to the Texaco Marketing Department with a focus on franchising and
marketing/distribution as well other transactional matters and contracts,
including licensing, trademarks and antitrust matters.

Woody is not from the Portland area nor does he have family here, but he has
travelled here extensively and would like to relocate to Portland.

From a timing aspect, Woody has another in-house offer from a bay area
employer with a two-week time table in which to reply.  He has expressed high
interest in an Enron opportunity and would be pleased to discuss his
background more in detail in a telephone pre-screening interview.  If you
would like to do that, let me know and I will set it up.

corporate rep.

The only other name that I recall having potentially significant involvement 
was Dave Marshall, an ECT risk management guy who appears to have had some 
discussions with IBC's Ron Anderson about Enron's requirements with respect 
to repaired/refurbished parts.  Bill believes there may be other Enron 
witnesses, and that Miller and Virgo will know who they are.

We are also working up a list of proposed mediators -- preferably with strong 
commercial litigation experience.  Gary McGowan currently heads the list, but 
I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions you may have.

Lastly, I agree with your suggestion regarding our question as to why the 
Wood Group (Robert Harrision) has appeared on Plaintiff's expert list.  It 
would certainly be helpful to have Miller's thoughts on that subject.

remaining bit of the claim against the  underwriters?  I believe you all have 
retrieved the whole file; however, let me know if there is anything we can do

I have not heard from you on the matter for some time and didn't get a 
response to my e-mail to you some months ago (16 Nov 99).

I note that we have since resumed trading with Hyundai (albeit with Hyundai 
Corporation and not Hyundai Singapore Pte Ltd which was the counterparty in 
the Pacific Valour case). I also understand that Enron Clean Fuels Company 
has chartered a vessel from Chembuk Trading which our broker advised to be an 
affiliate of MTM Ship Management (the bareboat charterers of the Pacific 
Valour and the likely respondents in an arbitration).

I presume the decision is therefore not to take the matter to arbitration and 
would like to close my file on the matter. However, if my understanding is 
incorrect, please let me have your instructions.

Many thanks and regards

Matt

Marilyn Ennis <Marilyn@CGASINC.com> on 01/26/2000 08:11:53 AM
Tom Campbell, the attorney in Licking County that filed our answer for the
Sitler complaint, called me to advise that Sitler's atty has requested a
deposition with Ken, myself, and Jud Byrd - one per week, beginning in
February.  I spoke with John Keller this morning, who is aware of this, and
has advised Bruce Oakley in Houston.

John told me to go ahead and give Tom some dates, and be cooperative, even
though it may not go forward.  I told John I would let you know what was
going on.  Call if you have any questions.

In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be 
admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity. It 
is hard to know the Evidence Rules of every jurisdiction. I would suggest the 
following language:

The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in 
any legal proceeding for any matters relevant to the Agreement, except for 
those recordings that violate the Parole Evidence Rule of the applicable 
jurisdiction.

Is this case still active? If so,what is the status?

I have just learned of another lawsuit involving CGAS.  This had been
handled by Jud Scheaf and had been dormant for a long time, which is why
neither I nor anyone at the company knew about it.

This is somewhat confusing, so let me try to explain.  The style is
Kilbarger Construction vs Eastland Energy Group, et al.  In the Court of
Common Pleas of Muskingum County, Ohio  Case No. CH96-0311.

CGAS had a lease in Muskingum County.  Eastland Energy had a lease on an
adjoining tract.  Eastland approached CGAS about going together to drill a
well on a unit formed by the two leases.  CGAS agreed.  Eastland was
designated operator.  Eastland hired Kilbarger as the drilling contractor.
Kilbarger drilled the well and it was dry.  Eastland thought Kilbarger
negligently drilled the well, so Eastland only paid Kilbarger half the
drilling cost.  Kilbarger filed a mechanics lien and filed suit against
Eastland for the other half of the drilling costs (approximately $30,000)
and also joined CGAS because of the mechanics lien.  Kilbarger was not
seeking any monetary recovery from CGAS, and the lien is meaningless since
CGAS has since released its lease.  Thus, we have no pending claims from
Kilbarger.

However, in the same case Eastland and CGAS have a claim pending.  During
the drilling of the well, some of the contractors would not work for
Eastland since they did not know Eastland - a new, small producer.  Those
contractors therefore did the work on the well for CGAS, billed CGAS, CGAS
paid those contractors, and CGAS then invoiced Eastland.  Eastland did not
pay and therefore CGAS has a claim in this suit against Eastland for
$7,139.69.  No monetary claim has been made by Eastland against CGAS.

I just learned of this case and have taken over this file from Jud Scheaf.
There is a settlement conference scheduled for December 9 and this case is
set for trial on December 16.  I am hopeful this will be resolved before
trial.  If there are questions, please call.

Please print out this memo with attachments and place it in the Calpine 
lawsuit file

As discussed, attached are materials gathered in-house as to ERCOT Summer 
1999 price movements, consisting of (i) a chart of high and low ERCOT B 
product prices for each trading day of the summer, as published in MegaWatt 
Daily, and (ii) articles from the Megawatt Daily indicating unusual price 
movements in the same period.  Our "InfoCentral" employee has indicated as to 
the latter that articles published on August 2, 3, 16, 17 and 19, 1999 made 
reference to "next summer", and may thus on their face be indicative of 
altered forward price curves.  Please contact me with any questions or 
comments.

As you know, several weeks ago we retained an attorney out of Wahington DC to 
assist us with the EPA permitting issues. The need for counsel was put on 
hold when we decided to move the plant. Is ther anything more we need to do 
to follow up on this matter?

Did we ever hear anything more from Mark Woolfolk? He was the attorney from 
Akin Gump in Houston who interviewed last month. All of the comments I 
recieved were very positive. The last I heard, you were talking to him about 
salary, but you were concerned that he was too far above our compensation 
level. Please let me know what I should do to follow up.

Attached is a letter re the above referenced.

Actually, when I say "retained " counsel, I mean we identified the best 
lawyer available and asked him to clear any conflicts. We don't need to do 
anything else.

Actually, I have a memo that will be finalized today.

The California Power Exchange (PX) is likely to issue a letter to its market 
participants indicating that Enron has broken the PX's rules by purposefully 
overscheduling an intertie causing congestion and a market price increase.  
The attached FERC complaint opposing PX action is probably not in final form 
yet, but I wanted to get you in the loop because it may be filed with FERC as 
soon as tomorrow.   The complaint explains that the PX tariff contains no 
prohibition against overscheduling and the California Independent System 
Operator, not the PX, schedules congestion over interties.  Further, under 
FERC precedent, without prior FERC review, the Cal PX should not be issuing 
letters finding violations.  Finally, the PX's analysis is seriously flawed 
because it doesn't consider market rules that actually caused the congestion 
and any potentially related price increase.  

We are very concerned about the PX's actions because we believe California 
utilities may be awaiting this letter to sue EPMI  (estimated claims ranging 
between $6 million and $47 million).  We probably want to aggressively 
publicise the filing so our side of the story comes out instead of the PX's.  
We have a meeting scheduled tomorrow with the PX where they will likely tell 
us if they will be issuing the letter.  Call me if you have any questions: 
(503) 464-8862.

I am in London this week for a series of meetings and an appeal to the House 
of Lords of the lawsuit that I was over here for in July(we won $130 USD) 
What a dreary place in the winter. I dont have much to report. I have been 
traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, 
LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her 
impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling 
rivalries going

I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our 
participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job 
with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his 
financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are 
pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for 
District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a 
Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her 
chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was 
not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me 
on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she 
will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to 
have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with 
their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition 
at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen 
anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a 
firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told 
me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it 
Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?

Richard, further to our previous discussions on how we should address Enron 
Canada Corp. in the ENA tape retention policy, I have prepared the attached 
rider which could be inserted as a separate heading for Enron Canada into the 
schedule identifying who has authority to access and approve the listening to 
of tapes.  Subject to any comments you might have, I think it works and 
properly identifies the parties Rob Milnthorp wants to have such authority 
here.

I would think that Lavo is now the other person besides yourself that needs 
to approve this.

Good to see you at lunch.  Coincidentally, I got back to my office and had
several emails from some of our lawyers up in Dallas, saying we had been
approached by Duke about representing them in a large gas litigation matter
brought against them by Enron.  I, of course, told them "HELL NO."  But let
us know if Susman screws it up, and you need us to bail you out.

Thanks again for the hospitality shown last week. I wanted to let you know 
that Fiona was especially helpful.

Cos 18 and 51 are the only ones I am familiar with and they cannot be

to confirm that there are no cases pending against them.

Pam would like our feedback on the following.  I imagine cos 18 and 51 are

be dissolved, but I don't want to respond to Pam without your feedback.

Talked with Tom Deen today. He wants to depose either Miller or Virgo on 3/9
and the other of them the next day, Friday 3/10. I said I'd check their
availability. Can you advise? He also said he wanted to depose another Enron
employee whom he claims actually went to Korea: one Harry Moltreu (sp.?)
Any idea who this is? He agrees on mediating the last 2 weeks in March, and
to a continuance of the April setting. He also confirmed that Natole had
sold either all or part of his business, but retained all interest in the
lawsuit. I said we'd want to go through this in Natole's deposition, and he
said they would have the details then. Natole is on for next Friday 2/18.

I just left you a voice-mail stating that I am available this morningor(even 
better) Monday morning.

Actually, I said I did not think we should pursue it, but that I wanted Harry 
to check w/ the client/trader to see how strongly they feel about letting it 
go. We have a lot of dog cases out there that someone feels strongly about. 
Any word Harry?

survey the machines at the Kunsan site.  Harry is currently the NEPCO site 
manager for the construction of a sixth unit at East Coast Power's Linded

I will be on vacation.

.After some period of orientation and adjustment(6 months?) all attorneys: 
senior counsel, assistant general counsel, and vice-president are expected to 
be independant. We don't have the time or the inclination to hold hands. 
There is no "standard" promotion track. If a senior counsel is successful, a 
promotion to asst. gen. counsel  will happen in1-3 years A promotion to VP is 
the closest thing we have to "making Partner" and generally takes 2-5 years. 
There is not that much compensation difference between a SC and a AGC.

Richard -

I understand we'll be meeting next week.  I figured one of the first things 
you'd be asking me for is an accounting on what Enron spent on the power 
plant, so I thought I'd pre-empt you and send it in advance.

Chris,

The attached schedule details the $1.3 million of costs incurred on the NSM 
Power Plant Project.  Note that until December 1999 these costs were deferred 
costs on our balance sheet.  In December, however, we wrote these costs off.

Thanks,

Would it be possible to get a printout of all the expenses incurred on the 
NSM Power Plant AFE?  An itemized list and total would be perfect if that is 
possible.  I need the list because ECT is being sued over their involvement 
and one allegation would be helped if we can prove that we were very 
committed to making the project work (e.g., through spending a lot of time 
and money on the power plant).

I'll need this by Tuesday afternoon if possible to give to the ECT 
attorneys.  Sending it by e-mail would be best so I can add a note and 
forward it on.

Thanks,

Chris

Plaintiff has canceled the hearing on its motion for summary judgment, which 
was set for this Friday.  Since I am sure they will re-set it if immediate 
settlement progress is not made, Ecogas has a window of opportunity to work 
out an acceptable deal.  However, I suspeect the window is not a very big one.

Our goal was to buy time.  Whether we bought it or not, we now have it.  I 
will get together with Randy and Jerrel to make sure we use it effectively.

Attached is the weekly status report regarding ENA Litigation.

Attached for your review is a letter to Julio Cesar Rocha regarding 
Votorantim.

The lawsuit against Agency.com was filed this afternoon.

Richard,

As requested, below please find language that I recommend be included in the 
Settlement.  The first sentence preserves Enron's right to appeal the 
findings of an ADR proceeding that may emanate out of this matter to FERC or 
any competent court; as it turns out, this right is provided under Section 
4.1 of the PX's Dispute Resolution Procedures.  The second sentence is 
intended to preserve Enron's right in other proceedings (as we have done 
already) to challenge the legality of ISOs and PXs to conduct investigations 
such as the one that they have in this instance:

"Nothing in this Settlement prejudices or limits Enron's rights under Section 
4.1 of PX Tariff Schedule 9, Dispute Resolution Procedures, related to any 
ADR proceeding that may address the same subjects that are addressed in this 
Settlement.  Moreover, although Enron has agreed not to seek review of the 
decision and order issued by the Chief Executive Officer in this proceeding 
based upon this Offer of Settlement, nothing in this Settlement prejudices 
Enron's right in other proceedings to challenge the CalPX's right, under 
United States federal law, the Federal Power Act, the Administrative 
Procedures Act, and applicable FERC regulations and decisions, to investigate 
allegations of improper market behavior and to issue findings and impose 
sanctions related to such investigations."

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.  Ron

Richard -- Yesterday, I received a call from Jill Ptacek, a lawyer from the
DOJ's Antitrust Division, regarding the remaining aspects of the DOJ's
Indiana Energy Investigation.  She has requested an interview with an Enron
employee who can describe Enron's experience in obtaining capacity on the
Texas Gas (Williams) and Panhandle (CMS) pipelines in Indiana.  The DOJ is
investigating whether Proliance is using its its significant capacity rights
on these pipelines to exclude or disadvantage third parties seeking access
in central Indiana.  Ptacek is requesting an interview this week or next
week.  Please let me know who we can make available for 60-90 minutes.

Can you have lunch on Monday?

I am very busy and very important but I will make an exception for you.

Ecogas and its affiliates have claims and lawsuits outstanding against them 
totaling over $8.5 million. These cases are, for the most part , suits to 
collect on unpaid debts, for which there are very limited defenses. The 
likelihood of success on the defenses of these cases is small.

Where else? Treebeards---on Market Square You pick the time.

Thanks for your research. I hammered the old coot on the head w/it this 
morning.

Let me know what time and please invite any judge you like.

I am not sure. but market square-treebeards it is.

When you get a minute, call those attys who stated (swore) otherwise and find

I have not heard  from Barbara about Eitan, but my reaction is that he is not 
a great fit because of his lack of legal experience. Typically, we don't hire 
first year lawyers unless there is a person who is willing to sponser(train) 
them. I know Barbara has been very pleased with Gerald Nemec, so her feelings 
might have changed about hiring someone so inexperienced. However, I know  
that Mark H. and Jim Derrick will be very skeptical.

Linda-- see if Barrett Reasoner knows of a video conference  in Houston.
Wondering if we should book a video conference here at Enron?? (or have we 
already?)
Dawne Davis <DDAVIS@HOLLANDHART.COM> on 03/09/2000 04:37:52 PM
In the past couple of days, I have been deluged with
last-minute requests to videoconference into the March 17
hearing on the motions to dismiss.  We are well past the
deadlines Sprint asked us to comply with (February 25 for
private sites and March 1 for public sites).  At this stage,
adding new sites to such a large, nationwide
videoconference is extraordinarily burdensome, requiring
Sprint to move the entire conference to a different bridging
system, change the dial-in numbers, etc.  Also of importance
is the fact that the bridging system has space limitations.

Please e-mail me with all videoconference requests no later
than 12 p.m. Mountain tomorrow (Friday, March 10).  After the
noon cutoff, we will no longer be able to entertain additional
videoconference requests.  In the meantime, I will do my
best to accommodate the late requests we've received.

I will be sending out a detailed memo tomorrow afternoon
that lists all the sites that have been booked, along with
those who've made reservations.  Each of you planning to
videoconference will need to check carefully to be sure your
reservation is reflected in my memo.  In addition, many of
the sites have extremely limited seating, so please do not
plan to show up at a public site without a reservation.

Thanks to all of you for your consideration.

When do you think we will here something ( if today) ?

If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA  related to 
the control area dispute. . While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue 
that although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, 
Enron has no damages because of the  FERC ruling. What are our chances of 
winning?

 By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to 
comment on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.

	Christi L Nicolay
	08/10/2000 04:27 PM
		 
Do you think we should appeal Entergy source and sink FERC order?  While I 
think it is a poorly written order that shows a lack of understanding of the 
issue, I'm not sure that we can win on appeal or that it is worth appealing, 
since we would not recover our damages against ComEd and TVA for this summer 
while the order is in effect.  It would be helpful next summer to be able to 
park in ComEd and TVA, since the RTOs will not be running in all likelihood.  

Elizabeth/Richard -- Is there a reason in the TVA litigation  that we need to 
appeal the decision?

Otherwise, Joe, should we get Dan W. to draft a memo on chances of success or 
other reasons for filing an appeal?

I know you have other things going on but can you draft 2 short letters to JB 
1)confirming your requests re Wisvest and 2)  outling you information 
requests re Ecogas SA. I will edit. 

	Randal Maffett
	08/14/2000 01:58 PM
		 
On Friday, August 4 JB and I had a discussion re: engaging Wisvest in a 
dialogue to resolve some of the major issues around the San Antonio project.  
In that discussion I reiterated what was discussed at the 8/2/00 Board 
meeting which was:  a) we needed to finalize the numbers re: the WMI royalty 
renegotiation; b) verify the expected EPC costs to complete the project; c) 
revise the project pro-forma to reflect the revisions in (a) and (b) and d) 
run sensitivity analyses on the level of subordination Wisvest would have to 
accept in order to make the project economics viable.  In our phone 
conversation on 8/4/00 we again agreed this was the right course of action to 
take.  Subsequent to that call, JB had conversations w/ Derek Price at 
Wisvest re: prospective meeting dates and exchanging various info re: the 
project.  In another phone conversation on Monday, August 7, I specifically 
asked JB whether he had sent the project pro-formas and/or other proprietary 
info to Derek Price to which JB responded "no."  He said he "... sent him 
summary info ... but did NOT send him the pro-forma ..."  I then asked him to 
forward to me copies of everything he had sent to Derek.  What he sent to me 
was some very basic e-mails and financial summary info.  I also asked Derek 
to forward to me everything JB had sent to him and I got a whole lot more, 
including the full-blown project model/pro-forma.  This has seriously 
diminished all of our negotiating leverage!

On 8/10/00, I became aware of some efforts that appear to involve JB in 
setting up a South American version of Ecogas (Ecogas S.A.) and called him to 
inquire as to what was going on.  In our phone conversation JB explicitly 
denied "any involvement" including any "ownership" in such an enterprise.  I 
also asked JB to forward to me by Friday, 8/11/00, copies of any and all 
documents, agreements, etc... relating to Ecogas S.A.  To date he has sent me 
nothing but an undated DRAFT MOU as well as some misc and meaningless 
correspondence (undated and/or old e-mails, etc...).  None of the info sent 
is what I asked for on August 4 (complete execution copies of the MOU 
regarding Ecogas S.A. including ownership interests, etc... as well as copies 
of Articles of Incorporation for Ecogas S.A., etc...Who is Ecogas S.A.?  
Where is it currently incorporated?  Who are the beneficial owners?  Under 
what authority are you transacting business (what is your title, etc...)  JB 
continues to reference "nothing has been signed, incorporated, etc..." - then 
why is JB's signature evidenced on an "Amendment" to the "Memorandum of 
Understanding:  Ecogas S.A. - Tortola/JCS"?  

JB referenced the need to "directing our efforts to resolution of the crisis, 
rather than continuing personal distractions and devisiveness."  For the past

greenhouse gas emission credits, etc...  To the best of my knowledge Ecogas

Read JB's response to my phone call below.  I'm not sure what's going on but 
if you read the info I had sent to you (via intercompany mail), there are a 
number of questions which are relevant:

Why does M. Panelo's e-mail reference JB's ownership being 33%?
Why is JB's signature on the MOU Amendment?  What is his authority as a 
signatory?  If he's not an officer of this "Ecogas S.A." then why is his 
signature evidenced?

We're trying to track down the faxes he referenced below.  Once received, 
I'll forward them if they're pertinent.

Randy,

I am concerned about our conversation of yesterday morning.  I sent by fax
to you all relevant documents I have concerning any South American details
which have Ecogas involvement.  As stated over the phone and set out in the
documents, I have never had any ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint-venture, etc. for South America relating to Ecogas.  The
documents which you suggest you have cannot represent any such interest as
it does not and never has existed.  I simply would not act in that manner
and would have expected you to hold that understanding.

Given the status of Ecogas' operations currently I want to suggest that we
all direct our total efforts to resolution of that crisis, rather than
continuing personal distractions and devisiveness.

Regards,

Jerrel

Richard:

My view is that TVA will likely use the FERC ruling to attempt to
retroactively bless their treatment of the Enron control areas last summer.
Although my understanding is that Entergy used a different method than that
employed by TVA to restrict the use of a no-load control area, TVA will
argue that the result is the same and that NERC has, thus, approved
differing treatment for load and no-load control areas.  The FERC ruling
will likely create a greater sense of unease on the part of the judge to
enforce the rules of NERC, a voluntary association, in the face of what
appears at first blush to be a contrary position taken by FERC, a federal
agency.

Bob

P.S. T.O. Helton has suggested that he sit in on the upcoming depositions of
Richard Shen and the 30(b)(6) rep. on TVA's alleged damages to get a better
feel for the case.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.

If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA  related to
the
control area dispute. . While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue that
although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, Enron
has
no damages because of the  FERC ruling. What are our chances of winning?

 By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to
comment
on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.

Do you think we should appeal Entergy source and sink FERC order?  While I
think
it is a poorly written order that shows a lack of understanding of the
issue,
I'm not sure that we can win on appeal or that it is worth appealing, since
we
would not recover our damages against ComEd and TVA for this summer while
the
order is in effect.  It would be helpful next summer to be able to park in
ComEd
and TVA, since the RTOs will not be running in all likelihood.

Elizabeth/Richard -- Is there a reason in the TVA litigation  that we need
to
appeal the decision?

Otherwise, Joe, should we get Dan W. to draft a memo on chances of success
or
other reasons for filing an appeal?

Please be advised that there will not be a conference call today.

No on #1. Yes on #2. One thing we may want to add in light of #2 is a 
confidentiality agreement so that Jung Ho  doesn't find out about the 
settlement.

I have spoken with Kirk Fulk for IBC, who has no changes of substance to the
settlement agreement. I also spoke with Tom Deen, who wants to send
revisions after Natole has read the document, which Natole can't do now
because he's travelling. Deen says they will want at least 2 changes of
substance:
1. Natole is asking for an indemnity from Enron and IBC for anyone who
claims through them. I told him this was not something we had talked about
before, and I wasn't sure how Enron would react to it, but my own reaction
was negative because Enron had no claims back against Natole (other than
financial offsets) so I fail to see why it's necessary. IBC is a different
matter because IBC filed a counterclaim against Natole.
2.  Deen wants the Natole indemnity to be capped at the amount of
settlement. In other words, Natole indemnifies Enron & IBC from claims by
Jung Ho (or others) only to the extent of $385,000. This again is not what
we talked about, but as a practical matter I'm not sure how much difference
it makes. Everyone seems to view the likelihood of further claims as remote.
Let me know your thoughts, and I'll forward any further proposals when I get
them.

Barbara Rayner and her team, Marlene Timberlake and her team (except for
Malcolm, who was unfortunately not available) and Randy teleconferenced
this morning as scheduled.  Here is what resulted:

1. We all think we can have values ready by Friday 8/31, but not full
reports which explain how we got to them and which are in formats
suitable for submission.  We need perhaps another week (but not a great
deal longer) to have suitable reports completed.  We believe this will
not be too much of a problem, based on Barbara's and Marlene's
discussions with respective counsels.

2. We all appear to be missing financial statements for Beal's Town car
for the year 1997.  Could Scarlett see if they are available and get them
to us?

3. There was minor confusion regarding Call Center as to which financial
forecast should be used.  There are at least three, but they are not
appreciably different.  Rand used the forecast accompanying the DASH.
Scarlett might want to double check to see which one is appropriate, if
this can be determined.  Not a major issue.

3. With regard to Tim's letter of 8/16 and Scarlett's response on 8/18:

A. None of us were influenced in any way by the Enron valuation numbers
submitted along with the Enron materials.  We are each preparing an
independent opinion.

B. On the Call Center interest, we will all address the issue of the
warrants: Rand pointed out that the warrants did not all vest
immediately, and that the 95.58% ownership assumption would incorrectly
reflect this.  I believe we all agreed that 82.3% is the proper ownership
interest as of 9/5/99, subject to revisiting the issue independently.

C. Everyone is treating Cynet as a separate item.  We all agree that
there is a legal issue as to whether an investment was made as of the
valuation date.  That is not an appraisal issue.

D. On the final accounting and the formula calculations, we would all
like the attorneys to explain to us exactly how these are to be treated.
Rand in particular is unclear as to how the final calculation should be
done.  We can discuss this at our Monday conference call, which Rand will
set up (through AT&T: they will call each of us) at 2:00 P.M. eastern
time, 1:00 Dallas.

4. We were unanimous in deciding that now is not the right time to share
results for several reasons:

A. We do not want to do anything that would contravene the Partnership
Agreement which might cause all of our good work (editorial comment!) to
be tossed out.
B. Sharing of "numbers only" results without final reports giving their
rationales is useless.
C. If we were to share "everything but the conclusions" now, we might
waste a great deal of time and money on minutiae, irrelevant things, or
arguments about issues on which appraisers can have legitimate
differences of opinion.

We propose instead the following:

A. We will each prepare reports and submit them as soon as possible
(relative to the 8/31 goal) as planned.  We will each submit full reports
that detail how we developed our conclusions, as well as what they are.

B. Counsels can then decide what they would like to do.  If they wish to
accept our reports and proceed, we are done.  If counsels agree
alternatively that they would like the appraisers to exchange reports, we
are equally amenable to that.  Each of us could then read the other
reports and (assuming counsels authorize this) reconsider our own
conclusions and revise them (if warranted) and/or comment on the others
in a constructive manner.  Again, we do not want to do anything that
would jeopardize the validity of what we have accomplished so far, but we
all want to cooperate to get this matter resolved.

I will talk with you all on Monday afternoon.

Richard: 

Ahab Garos, a young intern at McDonald during 1997-98, was deposed in New 
York this week.? We concluded that this particular deposition was not worth 
the expense of our attending personally, but we will be obtaining a rough 
transcript tomorrow and a final one later.? It is unlikely that Garos had any 
significant contact with Enron, and Mike Swartz advised us before the 
deposition that he did not intend to ask any "Enron questions."

Next week Aaron Izowar of White & Case is being deposed.? We think we should 
attend that deposition, and Roland is planning on doing so, unless you 
disagree.? Izowar coordinated a lot of the work in preparing the offering 
memorandum and is likely to be asked about Enron's role in that process.

I have looked through every Archive Log that I can find & cannot come up with

I called in a box from Archives that contains a thick file for the Conoco 109 
contract which is comprised of FERC, NGPA & TRRC filings only.

There is another box with a Conoco 109 file which is entitled "3rd Settlement 
of Gathering System Costs" which is in a storage room down on the 5th floor.  
According to Marianne, it contains worksheets, etc. & no contract.

Also, there is another box that had a Conoco 109 file containing purchase 
accounting information that is in a storage room in 3AC.  But, Marianne said 
that according to the check-out card in the box, the file was checked out to 
Bob Walker on 9/2/99.

Do you want to see any of the above files?  If so, I have the "Filings" File 
at my desk, I can ask Marianne to pull the "Settlement" File or I can check 
with Bob about the "Purchase Accounting" File.

Richard,

Rob has asked for some input on the proposed Draft Hague Convention relating 
to jurisdiction and the enforcement of foreign judgments.   One of the new 
proposals could have implications for trading.   The proposal would arguably 
subject a company to suit in a jurisdiction where it has an accessible 
website for conducting e-commerce.   However, under the Convention this grant 
of jurisdiction would apparently (I am still studying this) be overridden by 
a contractually-agreed forum selection clause.  Do our current e-business 
contracts contain a forum selection clause?  Would you anticipate that we 
would conduct trades in the future without a previously-agreed forum 
selection clause?

Thanks for your help.

As discussed, I received a call this morning from Bill Redmond (440/893-0338) 
who indicated that he is currently representing John Schultes (former CEO of 
NSM) in connection with certain litigation.  He explained that he was trying 
to coordinate depositions from Enron related to this investment.  

His view of appropriate Enron team members included:  David Leboe, Brian 
Vass, Brian Barth and Kevin McConville.

He mentioned the existence of a certain memorandum regarding a visit to 
Thailand that Vass and myself performed during late 1998 to address 
accounting and reporting concerns.  I did not comment on the existence of the 
memo.

Please find this memo included as an attachment.  Vass and I performed this

He is prepared to assist in bringing you up to speed with the litigation, 
however you should note that he is not an employee of the part of MG which 
Enron purchased and is assisting on a "grace and favor" basis to enable a 
smooth transition. I suggest that there is likely to be a limited window of 
opportunity in which to get the most from any briefing and you should speak

White & Case when he began working on the NSM offering in Oct. 1997.? The 
senior White & Case lawyers who worked on the deal have either changed firms 
or retired.

Highlights: 

--Hatch spent much of the morning on the off-take agreements and their 
description in the offering memo.? Izower strongly defended offering memo's 
description of the off-take agreements as accurate but would not cooperate 
with Hatch when asked to point out where in the off-take agreements Preussag 
or Klockner were "obligated" to purchase NSM's steel.? Izower's counsel 
objected to the questions as calling for a legal conclusion.? 

--Hatch walked Izower through the various drafts of the off-take agreements 
and asked if Izower had discussed the changes with the "underwriting group."? 
Izower testified that most of the comments were received from Gleacher 
Natwest, McDonald, Cravath and SDI.? Izower produced a responsibility 
schedule concerning certain documents related to the offering with completion 
dates.? Enron/ECT is not mentioned in the document as having had any role in 
the drafting although Izower did mention, as an afterthought, that Enron and 
Paine Webber may also have provided comments on the off-take agreements.

--Hatch established that the offering memo failed to disclose the existence 
of certain material agreements such as: 
a)????? Employment agreements between NSM and Swasdi Horrungruang and NSM and 
Chamni Janchai (who was thought of as being a crook) pursuant to which they 
received an annual salary of $350,000 for ten years;

b)????? A Throughput Agreement between Sriracha Harbor and NSM pursuant to 
which NSM offering proceeds would be diverted to the Harbor (which Swasdi had 
an ownership interest in) and to certain Thai banks who were owed sums from 
the Harbor.? Apparently, the Thai banks were threatening a foreclosure and 
take over of the Harbor jeopardizing NSM's ability to import and export 
materials.? The payment sums are not disclosed.? In less than convincing 
fashion, Izower indicated that the agreement was probably not mentioned in 
the offering memo as it may not have qualified as "related party transaction."

--Izower had no idea why the legal, financial and advisory fees on the NSM 
deal had increased from $29 million to $35 million.

Richard:  I must admit I feel like a real pain in the ___ since I know how 
much stuff you have going on, but I wanted to see if we could set up a call 
with you with some of our folks working on the Infineum lawsuit so that we 
are in a position to file responsive papers in the case shortly.  As we 
initially discussed, the factual situation relating to East Coast's history 
of dealings with Infineum (formerly Exxon) is incredibly complex as are the 
various contractual and other documents.  Jon Mostel, our principal 
transactions lawyer who has been working for more than a year with East Coast 
Power on the contract with Tosco (i.e., Bayway Refining Company), has been 
instrumental in providing the factual, legal and regulatory predicates for 
the East Coast deal and how Infineum fits into or is affected by that.  We 
have given significant thought over the past few weeks to the underlying 
issues in the case, the relevant precedent as well as the likely strategic 
moves at this point, taking into account the particular federal judge 
assigned to the case.  We would like to walk through our thought process with 
you to obtain your input on the case strategy at this point, particularly if 
Enron has a general policy or pre-disposition on the litigation side to go 
one way or the other from a procedural standpoint subject, of course, to the 
specific facts present in the case.  Could you let me know if there may be a 
convenient  time when you could speak with us.  You could call me or Steve 
Levitsky (212) 424-8309, one of my litigator colleagues here in New York who 
is assisting Stuart in preparing the case.  As I noted in my v-mails, Stuart 
recently has been involved in an ongoing trial in Federal Court in New Jersey 
and Steve has been taking the laboring oar on the necessary research and 
factual investigation and is fully familiar with the case.  Hopefully, we 
could do it before next Wednesday, but if it would be of any help I will be 
in your offices next Wednesday and with a little juggling I could probably 
visit you in your office sometime in the a.m. or afternoon and then plug our 
litigators in by phone.  Perhaps you could reply to this and let me know what 
might work for you.  Thanks.  I hope that you have a good holiday weekend.

retention policy?  My last understanding from you was you were going to work 
on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in

Chris,

Gail Brownfeld (Senior Counsel) has required that all EE&CC back up mail 
files be reviewed and any information pertaining to the following files be 
reproduced for the upcoming EE&CC litigation efforts.

1.  Any messages TO or FROM the following people that have the "extension"  
@bv.com for the time period 1992 to date. 

 Jim Leblanc
 Karl Breckon
 Ricky Simon
 Frank Hosak
 Larry Snyder
 Ray McPhail
 Bill Fox
 John O'Hearn

2.  Also, the following people from Black & Veatch worked in the EECC Houston 
office in 1995 and had Enron mail accounts.  Therefore we would need ANY 
email to/from these accounts:

 Eric Odenhouse
 Gary Townsend
 Robert Wood
 Bruce Godsey
 John Kruse

Ms. Brownfeld indicated that the document review by Enron's outside counsel 
has a six week window.  This is week two of those six week.  Therefore, it 
has been requested that this task receive top priority.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or require addtional information.

Regards
Roberto DeLeon
  

Do these two e-mails relate to the same litigation I sent to you?

Jeff,

I attach an affidavit in support of MG's claim against Base Metal Trading Ltd 
to release an escrow order over aluminium cargoes held in the Port of 
Baltimore - this also gives a brief description of the facts.

In short, Base Metal Trading have obtained an attachment order in respect of 
the goods; however, MG is claiming that title to the goods is vested in MG.  
I will send you separately other correspondence, and will keep you posted as 
to progress.

Regards

Justin

I spoke again with Ely Goldin of Egorov, Puginsky, Afanasiev & Marks, who
represent Base Metals.  I told him we have paid for the material and have
clean
bills of lading.  He said they weren't looking to "jam anybody up" and woul=
d
try
to resolve the situation upon receipt of our paperwork (which I have just
received from Keith Whitehead) indicating our payment for the material and
our
rightful ownership of same.

Unless this matter is otherwise resolved, their intention is to let the
vessel
continue discharging and seize the material thereafter.
Rukert Terminals advised me that a U.S. Marshall and two lawyers have
already
been onboard the vessel and have confirmed this.  Discharge is continuing
with
our cargo expected to be completed by next Wednesday.  I've conferred with
our
lawyer, Arthur Taylor, and will fax the documents to Goldin this afternoon,
who
will look them over and get back to me tomorrow.

Bob Klide

Bob, Nicole and Jean,

WELCOME BACK !!!

Following received from Orwell............. (Plse see attached below)
...............

Now we have to act quickly, but all moving in the same direction.

If we assume the entire cargo will be attached once the discharge operation=
=20
has
finished, then we should all realise that this represents $5,000,000.00 of =
our
money tied up on the quay, not to mention the inability to deliver against =
our
existing commitments.

We have couriered about 60 pages of further documents we received from=20
Aluminium
of Siberia proving the chain of ownership from the smelter to Aluminium of
Siberia and with copies of the RWB showing the metal was all despatched wit=
hin
April from the smelter.

Have we placed Base metal on notice that now they have attached the metal w=
e
reserve the right to counter sue for all costs and expenses WE may suffer a=
s a
result of their attaching metal to which we have clear title ???

Talk to the court in Maryland and establish what additional documentation t=
hey
actually require for us to prove beyond doubt that the metal is ours.

Speak to our lawyer and ask 'What should we do next ???'

For the avoidance of doubt no correspondence should be sent
to any of the counterparties unless it has been approved by the
lawyers.Martin Stanley is coordinating our response and should
be appraised of all correspndence,either verbal or written.

Marc Rich/Novarco are some way further down the track in their
similar problem and expect to have their case heard over the next
few days in New jersey.We should keep appraised of their progress.

As regards our stance I think that we should now take steps to hold
the plaintiff responsible for any costs incurred due to the attatchment
and we should ask the court to require the m to post a bond against
such costs.

Any comments welcome

Spoke with Sandra Torres this morning.  She advised me we've had no further
correspondence from the Base Metals attorney, Ely Goldin, and a copy of an
e-mail from you indicates that the material is definitely being seized.  I
told her to speak with our attorney, Art Taylor, to determine what steps he
wants to take next.

I'll be reachable most of the day if you need me.  My home phone numbers ar=
e
516-489-3116 or 516-489-9291.  An overseas call to my private cell phone
would be prohibitively expensive, but Sandy Torres has it if I need to be
reached.

I'd appreciate copies of any e-mails on this subject to this e-mail address=

check with Rukert Terminal to determine when discharge is complete and to

It's 10:30 PM here and I haven't seen any correspondence relating to the
"Salvador" from anybody.

Martin, I managed to finally get hold of Ely Goldin at about 5 PM.  He said
he was going to e-mail me a copy of a fax he was sending but I never saw it=
.
I told him in no uncertain terms that he was indeed "jamming us up" and tha=
t
if our material wasn't released to us, we'd have to cover our nearby
commitments from other sources at huge cost and would hold Base Metals
responsible.  He said he needed to establish some link between Aluminium of
Siberia and the Russian smelter and he wondered why the shipper on the bill=
s
of lading was Unimetal (or Uni something - I don't quite remember the name)
and what was their relationship to Alum. of Siberia.  I told him we bought =
it
in good faith and there may have been any number of companies in the chain
who were really of no concern to us.  At that point, Art Taylor was calling
him on the other line.  I decided that call was more important so we ended
the conversation.

I trust you have since received an e-mailed update from Sandy as to the
contents of their phone call with Goldin (which someone please e-mail to me=
).

I'll be out of the house all day tomorrow but will have my cell phone with
me, although I expect to be out of range most of the time.  I'll call the
office late morning/early afternoon to get an update.  Sandy, since Art is =
on
vacation, did he suggest that Greg Clausson might be of assistance?  He mig=
ht
be more readily available to file any necessary legal papers, unless he's
also on vacation.

Pleased to recap CURRENT situation as follows:

On Friday 7th July, Judge Garbis (District of Maryland) ordered that the
attachment of our metal be vacated (i.e. released), but that ANY proceeds f=
rom
any sales be paid to:

Bank of America,
10 Light Street,
Baltimore,
MD 21202

Account name: Miles and Stockbridge P.C.

Account number: 00 200 382 2806 (Escrow).

We intend to challenge this condition immediately - hopefully Tuesday /
Wednesday (11th / 12th July).

Judge Garbis appears to be on our side, but since this was a 'Friday=20
afternoon'
judgement he has allowed Base Metals a little more time to try and prove we=
=20
were
involved in some 'fraud'.

The Judge told their lawyers that he could see NO indication of any such
evidence and that they had to 'put up or shut up'

Martin:
 Sorry I was unable to catch up with you on Monday; I tried your office and
"cell" phone, but called too late in the day.
 I think we should keep pushing here. I'm inclined to send Ely and company =
a
letter suggesting that they now have enough documentation to show them that
MG does, indeed, own the metal and that they should voluntarily release the
escrow arrangement. I would combine that with a representation that both MG
Corp and MG Ltd are quite solvent and more than able to cover a $5MM loss i=
n
the extremely unlikely event that Base Metals could ever prove to a court
that MG owed that amount to them. I would couple this with a request that w=
e
have an all parties conference call no later than Wednesday to discuss our
respective positions. If we can not achieve a result satisfactory to us,
then I feel we should go back to the court, probably no earlier than Monday
so as not to make it look to Judge Garbis that we are being excessively
aggressive.
 Our easiest argument to the court at this early stage is probably one base=
d
on our solvency, i.e., "Judge there is no need for you to escrow MG's money=
,

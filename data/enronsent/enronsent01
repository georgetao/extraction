2.	Entergy - 

		They want a straight 7x24, 365-day power purchase @ fixed price.

		Capacity:	65MW
		Start Date:	July 2002
		Term:		5 Years
		Price:		$x/MWh

3.	TVA - Peaker

		Really want intra-day call w/4hr notice for 4hr minimum run time.

		Capacity:	Tell me what, if any, we can do.
		Start Date:	June 2004
		Availability:	5x16 June-Aug; Dec-Mar
		Heat Rate:	10,900
		VOM:		$2/MWh

		Let's really try to see if we can do the intra-day.  If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.  If this is absolutely not possible, let's try 		to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.

4.	TVA - Combined Cycle

		This one we already quoted at $3.97/KW-mo for 4-year, 5x16 call, beginning 		1/1/03 for 7,000 Heat Rate; $2 VOM.  This was for day-ahead, 16hr min run time.  		Tell me how much the price changes if we reduce min run time from 16hrs to 		8hrs.

Please call me in NY @ 212-715-5953 to discuss, if you have any questions.  Thanks for all your work.  I think we have a real opportunity here, if we can respond positively on a few fronts.

Hi Harry,

   The Chemist in Delhi (Kuber Chemist ) has requested for the phone number for New Jersey address. I presume that is required by the courier service in India. He also mentions that the medicines will take about a week to arrive from the date of departure.

1. Bruce Sukaly did call me and I am having  lunch with him tomorrow.
2. Could you share more of the presentation you have? It is very informative about their thought processes and ideas. It would be nice to gloss through that whole thing (I dont need to keep a copy or anything)

As you know, following the downgrade, there is total inability for us to trade.  I dont think it makes any sense to put any numbers anywhere.  Give me a call and I would like to chat about various stuff should trade and where the current markets are.
 
Hope you are doing well.

Monaco,
	Traders speculate, pure and simple. At least that what I do. The new team in Houston is the Texans. I don't really care who they are. The knicks stink. Talk to you soon.

Good, you can go from one wet loser state, to a dry hot loser state.

Good luck trading gas. After eating Taco Bell, I usually make enough to
power all of Long Island for a month.

How does a trader earn their keep? you get a commission selling to another
firm or speculate on price movements and take a position?

Let me know when you are in NY, so I can ensure that I am away. 

Good luck in Houston, go Titans!!

"Mono"

Monaco,
	Whats up with you? Great SuperBowl. I hate the Rams, so glad they
lost. I'm going down to Houston to work for UBS on the gas trading desk. New
commodity for me, should be fun. Looking to get back to NY at some point in
the future. I know you'll still be there, stinking up the joint. Anyway,
will let you know how things go. Talk to you soon.

Badeer

Still around!!!!

Pleae review attached Assignment sent by Craig Breslau.
PCS Nitrogen would like to assign their positions with Enron over to Bank of America.  The structure of the deal would be for B of A to step in between Enron and PCS.  Currently, PCS is out of the money to Enron.  This trade would lower B of A's exposure to Enron.    I would like to give an answer to PCS today.  Could you please review and let me know how we proceed o n this assignment.

Thanks,
Craig
Craig,
Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two
companies.

Craig,

Brent has reviewed the Assignment and suggests that we use the ENA form of Assignment.  Reason being -- the last B of A deal (when using their document), which involved a similar scenario was abit confusing.

Brent said our form will be with PCS as assignor rather than ENA.  
However, before we can finalize -- Credit must approve.

Jay,

Please advise if assignment of PCS deals are OK with Credit.

Tanya,

As you know, Anne Koehler has been negotiating a master agreement with CRRC over the past several months.  Currently, Anne is in NY @ an ISDA conference and will return to the office on Thursday, November 29th.  However, yesterday Laurie Orchard @ CRRC called inquiring as to the status of our review to their latest round of comments (some which were Credit in nature).  Laurie asked that I touch base with you to get your thoughts, so that when Anne returns on Thursday -- we will be closer to a final document form.

Therefore, attached for your review is a "redlined" version of the latest master agreement draft.  In reviewing such document, please keep in mind that CRRC really wants the following to prevail:

1.	Part 1(h) of the Schedule:  CRRC would like such language to be included as they have concerns with bankruptcy events.
2.	Part 5(j) of the Schedule:   CRRC provided transfer language, which Anne knew they were to furnish.
3.	Paragraph 13(b)(ii):	CRRC prefers to include only cash, because (B) & (C) do not apply.
4.	Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(B):	CRRC is more conservative with regard to their matrix threshold and wish that the changes be accepted as noted.
5.	Paragraph 13(g)(i):	CRRC wishes to include "or in Bermuda", because that is where they maintain their LCs.

Please be advised, there was one other change CRRC requested, which related to Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(B) -- the determination of the exposure in weather-related deals.  As you know, Anne has furnished such language to Mark Tawney for his comments.  I do not believe that Mark has responded.  However, CRRC is willing to address this later under an amendment to the master.  Therefore, as you can see they are rather eager to sign a master with ENA and they are willing to address some of their issues at a later date.

   
Let me know your thoughts.

Hi all!

We went looking at puppies this weekend, supposedly
just "to look," and of course end up bringing one
home!  She has already made the trip to the office and
one of my co-workers had his digital camera here to
take pictures for Halloween!

Hope to talk to each of you soon!

Love, Julia

 Could you confirm with Janet if the two deals mentioned above should be

well.  Just let me know.

a little snooty huh?

   
	
	

yes

Are you sure this is Gas Mktg?  I have a deal ticket that shows Reliant.

-Eric

   
	
	

The deals should be Entex Gas Mktg. Eric, could you please change that name.

Thanks,
Ami
	
	

Ami,
 
 Could you confirm with Janet if the two deals mentioned above should be 
Reliant Energy - Entex or Entex Gas Marketing?  Entex called & advised they 
show it to be a sell to Entex Gas Marketing & that's the way I see it as 
well.  Just let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hey Danny,

When does the next flag football season start at the YMCA?  We would like to 
play in the next league.

Also,  are you planning to have another flag football tournament this 
summer?  If so, when?

Thanks,

Eric

Hello Everyone,

I hope that you all enjoyed the holidays, and I'd venture to say that most of 
you enjoyed it more than I did.  I did however have a great New Years.  It 
actually inspired this email.  On the 6 hour trip back to Houston from New 
Orleans yesterday Tim and I came to the conclusion that the analysts haven't 
gotten together in awhile and decided to arrange a gathering.  We were 
thinking about doing Texadelphia tonight for the Sugar Bowl.  It's located at 
6025 Westheimer (ph # 713-785-6700).  Also, I think we are going to do 
Woody's on Richmond Thursday night if anyone's interested.  Please let me 
know if you plan on attending.  I think we are going to head over there 
between 6:30 - 7:00.

Hope to see you all tonight!!

LISA

I think you are just trying to avoid me!  It's been two weeks, huh?  

I'll be up late tonight watching the national championship, so give me a call 
when you get in.

Shirley Elliott <shelliott@dttus.com> on 01/04/2000 10:53:41 AM
   are you back at work yet?  sorry i didn't call last night but i got home
   pretty late and had to do some stuff.  i'll try to call you tonight but
   probably won't get home until after 10.

   shirley

Same to you!  
And I hope you and your family have a HAPPY NEW YEAR!

I just received a directive to obtain a list of the name of each file that is 
saved to a disk.  For example:

H / Gas Risk / Firm Trading / Spreadsheet / Y2K
H / Gas Risk / Firm Trading / West / Gas Daily Deals
H / Gas Risk / Firm Trading / East / Basis Curves

etc .....

Please provide this list to us when you come to 3084 to save your files.

Thanks!

Please remind your guys to report Gas Daily positions for Dec. and Jan 
between now and the end of the month.  In some cases January gas daily 
positions may not be coming in automatically and will have to be plugged.  
This a result of computer logic problem and not an ERMS/TAGG problem.  Also,  
there should no January basis positions starting tomorrow.

Hey Melissa,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner but I have been using up my last 
bit of vacation.  I have been keeping track of the accrual value estimate but 
I want to get some confirmation from the transport and marketing groups on 
how we want to account for it.  I'll let you know soon.

-Eric

   

Eric, 

Please let me know how the Accrual Value estimate is coming. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Eric, 

With the new Wellhead Portfolio, will Greg's Accrual income be readily 
identifiable?

He is looking to have adjustments made to credit him accrual income for both 
the 3rd and 4th Quarters.  Will you be able to back into these numbers using 
this portfolio? 

If you have an estimate number of what the accrual value would be, just let 
me know, and I can pass that along to Greg. 

Thanks,
Melissa

Are you going to return my e-mail?
Toomer, Freeman, and Mcnabb for Bruce.

That is a great deal for you.

Read this--it's not that long!

Hate to promote the obvious.  US News & World Reports has their most current 
college rankings out, and, yes, Texas is in the top 50 schools in the 
country.  A$M in the meantime has returned to their fabled "second tier" 
status where all "second tier" schools belong.  I don't really care if Texas 
Monthly prints a huge front page article that says "UT....THE BEST SCHOOL IN 
TEXAS".....Of course Texas Monthly would never do that because IT ISN"T 
NEWS!!!!!!!   Tell us something we don't know!  You will recall that a couple 
of years ago, Texas Monthly reported that a$m was "the best school in Texas", 
relying on US NEWS & WORLD REPORTS rankings.  I guess that was short lived.

http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/natunivs/natu_a.htm
 - att1.htm
 -  USNews - edu.url
Whoops.  Looks like a$m is STILL ranked considerably lower than Texas in both 
Business and Engineering, in spite of the fact that every agroid will tell 
you differently.

I apologize for the short notice.  I am cancelling today's meeting due to the 
need to analyze the OA's and the matrix.  Please let me know if you guys will 
be available next Wednesday for a meeting(lunch will be provided).  I should 
have the info sooner than that, I would just like to keep on our normal day.  
Due to the holidays, some people may be out.  Let me know if you are able to 
attend that day so that I can order enough lunch.  Thanks.  Sorry again for 
the short notice.

   I think we'll have a lot of fun this weekend.  Sierra sounds good to me.  I
   really like that place--I was just there the other night for a recruiting
   dinner and it's all decorated for Christmas.

   Jill, Matt's date, who works at Deloitte also lives all the way out in the
   Woodlands and she is probably going to come to my house and get ready.  I
   guess we'll figure out the rest of the specifics later.

   Tomorrow is going to be a pretty rough day here at my client; so give me a
   call tomorrow night, if that's ok.  Or you can email me--for some reason I
   didn't get your email until 5:30 today and it looks like you sent it during
   lunch.

Hey Shirley,

I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that I am looking forward to
Saturday night.  I don't know the specifics yet, but Chad and Matt had planned
on going to Sierra for drinks at around 7:30.  I'll give you a call tomorrow 
to
let you know all of the details.

See you soon.

Eric, I have reviewed the users that have access similar to yours and want to 
confirm if they are in the Risk Management group for Texas/HPLC.  Please let 
me know which users are not in your group and also add people in your group 
that I have not listed.

In addition, I noticed that some users have a Risk Management role while 
others have a Trader role.  The ONLY difference between those two roles is 
that the trader roles allows you to have access to Trade Blotter.  If no one 
is entering trades directly into Trade Blotter, let me know so that I can 
change everyone's roles to the Risk Management role.  It makes it a lot 
easier when I am trying to categorize users.  You still have access to Deal 
Ticker, Deal Manager (read/edit) and Position Manager under the Risk 
Management role.  Thank you for your time in advance and for your quick 
responses.  I understand that you are busy so please take your time in 
getting back with the requested information.

There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of 
calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL 
reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover 
books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other 
non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the 
entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In 
running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading 
which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must 
cover this. 

You can send future lists to me.

Thanks,

Eric

What group are you in (e.g. Logistics, Risk Management, Trading, Settlements,

What desks to you deal with (e.g. West, East, Texas, HPLC, All, etc.)?  
Please list only the ones you deal with and need access to.

Please provide responses to the questions noted above so that I can ensure 
that you have the adequate security for Sitara.  If you have any questions, 
please call me at x35423.  Otherwise, please reply to me as soon as you can 
so that I can make the necessary updates.

Brett,

Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare 
time on your hands.  
Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading 
gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times 
(lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like 
you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking.  
Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to 
Ft. Sill.  Do you get to see each other much?  

Where are you currently stationed? 

Drop me a line next time you come to houston?

-out

Hey y'all,

Got bored, made a homepage, lemme know what you think.

address is:  http://lawlerspage.homestead.com/

I'm not sure but I think if I edit or add stuff to the page you have to
re-enter the address if u had it bookmarked so I reckon if u bookmark it and
it don't work it's cause I added some stuff.  Either that or it was just a
freak one time thing (I tried to use my bookmark today and it no workie).

Lawler, OUT.

Hey Gillette,

The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction 
date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.  

Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to 
supply you with some of the guidelines.

Hey Bass,

I have a question and I am hoping you can help me.  I am wanting to compile a 
list of all the different types of power plants and their respective heat 
rates to determine some sort of generation ratio.

i.e. Coal  4 mmbtu = 1 MW
 Simple Cycle 11 mmbtu = 1 MW

Please let me know if you can help me or point me to someone who can.  Just 
FYI...Bryan suggested that I call you so blame him as you curse me under your 
breath right now.

Thanks,
Lisa

whole tournament and Gosset for at least the first game. 
Everyone must be there on TIME. That means that you must be at the fields no 
later than 8 AM! We now only have 10 guys for the first game!!!!!!!

If you can't make it at 8 AM, tell me know so we can replace you!!!!! 
EVERYONE e-mail me and let me know that you will be there by 8 AM! Gosset 
will fire you if you screw the team!!!!

Mike,

When (if :-) ) you have a minute could you do me a favour and send me an 
excel dump of all the deal numbers of GTMA Physical forwards we are expecting 
to settle for march production (27th to 1 April), with their projected 
volumes, the contract price, and the value?  This will help me get an idea of 
whether we have any missing data.  

Thanks

James

that sounds great

   

What did I tell you??  That's good though- I'll get to see you.  I need to go 
to the grocery- but I left my list at home.  Guess I'll go tomorrow.  And 
I'll cook Thursday and Saturday night.  How does that sound?
Lisa Gillette@ECT

 I hate to say this, but maybe its best if we reschedule.  it doesnt sound 
like we are all going to be able to make it by 6 and i would rather not be 
rushed considering we see each other once every 6 months.

let me know what you girls think.  maybe we should try a weekend lunch?

That's it.  Thanks to plove I am no longer entering my own deals.

What's up guys?  Sorry for this mass e-mail, but you have got to see this
... be careful if you are viewing this at work or anywhere public.  I know
there are a few of you I haven't been in touch with for a while, but please
forgive me as I've been tied up in a shithole in Paducah, KY.  I hope all is
well with you.  Enjoy this e-mail.  BTW - Jared, this is a REAL forward ...
send me more of this stuff instead of the other crap that comes my way!
Adios,
Patrick

If only I knew who these girls were!

Any hotel suggestions for Sherman?
ShermanCF@aol.com on 03/12/2001 03:21:47 PM
Michael is working at CSR.  I do not know what that is, but at least he is 
working.  He is living in that neighborhood behind Haverty's.  I do not know 
who he is living with.  He is not dating anyone.  Michael Smith is engaged.  
I think they are getting married either this summer or next summer.  I can't 
remember.
I need your help.  When I get married in June we are going to leave out of 
Houston and fly to Cancun.  But, I need a nice hotel to stay in the night of 
the wedding in Houston.  I need suggestions, phone number, etc.  Also, I want 
a limo to take me from the reception in Conroe to the Hotel in Houston.  I 
need suggestions and phone numbers for that also if you do not mind.  Thanks 
Shanna Lynn.

Hey Dad,

Did you talk to the better half?  I was thinking Trulucks but if you can't 
attend I understand.

Let me know,

Eric

	
	

Eric,

Counterparty would like to see volume as 910,000/mo rather than 29355/day, 
due to the 5 MMBtu discrepancy our volume causes.  Can you adjust TAGG to the 
per month volume?

Thanks,
Joe

friday is better but that is fine

   

Well Stacey called in sick today and Eric and Elsa cannot do lunch so I have 
a new plan.  How about Thursday (preferably) or Friday starting at about 4:00?
This way we can have beer and peanuts ans all can attend.  Please let me know.

Andrea,

At this time, I plan to extend my rotation indefinitely.

Thanks,

Eric Bass

   

Eric, will you be rotating at this time?

I can't play this weekend.  The earliest I can play would be Sunday December 
17.

Let me know if this works

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the Enron Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

-Mike  ext 37842

--
Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think 
this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday is as good as any.  If not this 
weekend, you will need to organize this as I will be on vacation for the next 
two weeks.

Are you in on the game tonight?

in

   

	
	                           
	

I'm not sure what time the game is tomorrow, I think 7, but unfortunately 
ya'll will have to do w/o me.  I know it will be tough making up for my 4 pts 
and 2 reb per game, but I think you will survive.  We play Hiemstra's team, 
and he said they are terrible, so good luck.  Let me know if you will be able 
to play, and if we're short I'll try and find a sub.

I can't make it during lunch.  Sorry.

   

OK Gang,
Time to select (and pay) for 2001 tickets.
What I have is:
Gary Lamphier  25 games
Greg Brazaitis  20 games
Jason Mathew  10 games $340
Stacey Neuweiler 10 games $340
Eric Bass     5 games $170
Elsa V      5  games $170
Danny Conner     5  games $170

Jim Homco has two seats next to us and is hoping to trade so any of us can 
have 4 seats to a game and he can then have 4 seats to a game.
We need to draft this week.  I will set the rotation by number of tickets 
purchased to start the rotation then random draw.  In other words I will pick 
1st, Greg 2nd,
Stacey & Jason 3rd & 4th ( I will flip a coin that day) and Eric , Elsa and 
Danny to follow ( we will draw an order that day).  
So in summary there are 16  packages of 5 games; so every 16 games I will get 
5, Greg 4, Jason  and Stacey 2, and the other 3 one.
So round 1 would look like this:

 1) Gary
 2) Greg
 3) Jason/Stacey
 4) Jason/Stacey
 Picks 5-16 will then be pulled out of a hat to determine order for all 
remaining picks with Gary's name 4 times, Greg 3 times, and every one else 
once.
We need to do this this week.  How about Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday from 
11:00 - 1:00 (we should finish earlier).  The schedule is at astros.mlb.com 
or I will bring hard copies for you.

Please respond today of any date that does not work.

   

Hey Gary,

Just wanted to let you know that I will not be in the office from March 
12-16.  So whenever you want to select the Astro tickets and get the money

let me know.

Thank you

hey mom,

we drove by some houses in the potomac area - the problem is that all of the 
newer houses are in the $600K+ range.  the older houses are not much to look 
at from the outside but iw ould like to see some.
i have cash for dad but if you don't need it that is fine.  my bill thus far 
is $500 but i can pick it up this weekend.

i had no idea about the date change - when is it?

Love,
e

Hi Eric,
?
Did you see any houses yesterday??  
?
Did you get cash for Dad?? We forgot to  ask.? Don't worry about it.? I got 
my limit increased at the grocery  store so it won't be a problem anymore.? I 
do owe you a check.? What  is your address so I can mail it to you?? Or, do 
you want to pick it up  this weekend?? How much do I owe you, $400 or $500?
?
Did you have a good time with D and Jason  Friday?? I hear they have changed 
the wedding date.? Did they say  anything to you?
?
Have a great day.?  LU-M

BRIAN HOSKINS@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS
02/20/2001 09:18 AM
Box Score Banter
The following question and statistical numbers come via J.C. Corrigan of 
Richmond, Va.

He asks:

"Which conference is best? Pac -0? ACC? SEC? Big 10? Big 12? Big East? Using 
the RPI, I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference (ACC is the 
smallest in terms of members, and I threw out their "Russian judge" team). 
If you were to add these individual team RPI up, the least sum would 
indicate the greatest depth:

Big Ten, 178; SEC, 194; Big East, 246; Big 12, 278; ACC, 369; Pac-10, 382.

Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams, since half 
are forced into a losing record. Others say, only one team can win, so why 
concern yourself with the bottom feeders? To refute that, here's what the 
sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference:

SEC, 40; Pac-10, 41; ACC, 48; Big Ten, 49; Big East, 66; Big 12, 69.

If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders, then we want to make 
sure there are no "gimmies" for those teams on top. So what's the RPI rating 
of the lowest team in each conference?

SEC, 103 (LSU); Big Ten, 135 (Northwestern); Big 12, 157 (Texas Tech); Big 
East, 167 (Virginia Tech); ACC, 168 (Clemson) Pac-10, 173 (Washington State)

Others will argue that we should include each team and then "normalize" 
based on the number of teams per conference. This will also account for the 
small differences between teams and reward second-tier team strength. Here 
are the conferences with their average RPI and median RPI.

SEC (39.1, 38.5), Big Ten (39.4, 29.0), Big East (45.2, 49.0), ACC (59.7, 
35.0), Big 12 (66.7, 47.0), Pac-10 (70.8, 55.0).

This data clearly shows how "top heavy" the ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 are. But 
who's the best? When evaluating where each conference ranks across the these 
five categories:

SEC: 2-1-1-1-3 8

Big Ten: 1-4-2-2-1 10

Big East: 1-5-4-3-4 17

ACC: 5-3-5-4-2 19

Big 12: 4-6-3-5-4 22

Pac-10: 6-2-6-6-6 26

The SEC has a slight edge over the Big Ten, but some may say the RPI is 
biased. So how would these numbers hold up using the Sugaring Ratings?

SEC: 10

Big 10: 11

ACC: 12

Big 12: 20

Pac-10: 22

Big East: 29

Personally, I think the RPI is a little more accurate. Hope you found this 
interesting in my attempt to answer the oldest question in the NCAA book. 
Ideally, I would like to include head-to-head competition and run these 
numbers, but I'm an amateur and I don't that much time on my hands."

Hey Dad.  I am looking forward to Vegas.  Hopefully I won't lose too much $.  
I am glad that I was able to add a little more happiness to her life.  Tell 
Aunt Twila and Uncle Gene hi for me and have a good time this weekend.

Love, Eric

Hi Guy. Do hope you have a great trip to Vegas. It  should be fun. Do not let 
those tables become too attractive to you. The more  time you spend @ the 
tables the greater the odds are that the house will take  your money. I talk 
from experience. Nice touch on the flowers to your Mom. She  really is 
enjoying them. It made her feel good that you remembered her on  Valentine's 
Day. Call us when you get home. Love-Dad

not yet - when does she play?

Did you find anything out about Martina McBride?

we are staying at the mirage.  it could be dangerous - i might come home a
millionaire or broke

I was just wondering.  Where are you staying?

Yes.  We are supposed to leave tomorrow.  Why?

Eric,

Are you going to Vegas this weekend?

yeah, they sent me some candy ass  "sorry" letter. no $ though

Eric,

Did you ever hear back from America West?

i havent heard anything yet - i will let you know though

Eric,

Will you have any opportunities for Rodeo tickets through Enron?

Big talk for a guy whose school is on NCAA probation as we speak.  

http://www.ncaa.org/databases/db1/probation.html

By the way, I see from the latest RPIs that LSU is really pulling their 
weight as the lowest-ranked team in the SEC, right behind Austin Peay.  But 
hey, at least you're still ahead of Iona and Bradley.

Excerpt from an article on espn.com

Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and 
football,
                  ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
too fragile to
                  countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his 
watch.

Enough said.

Apparently the doctor says it's ok... I bet she said that she was better, but 
not "hey, it's ok
to go out, drink and dance in a room full of smoke and people." 

I went to the doctor yesterday and she said I'm much better.  Trust me, I
haven't been out in an entire month, I am SO ready to do some drinking and
dancing!
Thanks for emailing Brian.

we can hold off on seeing the w alabama house.  just let me know about the 
time for tomorrow

Good deal.  I think you'll like Bob but, like Dad said, don't feel
obligated.  Don't forget to put the contracts in a folder/envelope and bring
them along.  How many copies did you make?  I'll call the realtors and see
about tomorrow.  Did you want to see 400 W. Alabama again?  It's usually
open on Sunday. LU-M

Hey Mom,
I would like to see the Mandell and the Huldy - preferably tomorrow before 
4ish.  Let me know if that works for you.  Dad is welcome to see whichever 
houses he would like.

FYI, I am meeting with Bob Dunn today after work, and I made copies of the 
contracts.

L,

Hi Eric,

Do you want me to check with the realtors to see if those houses are open
this weekend and, if not, do you want me to make appts.?  Let me know.  I'll
do that today.  I would like Dad to see Mandell but that's up to you.  He
can't do it today, I don't think.  But, if you would like to see something
today, I'll try to arrange it.  I would prefer to see all of them the same
day but I will leave the up to you.  I didn't want you to think that I have
forgotten about you.  Did you download the contract and make copies?  LU-M

Come talk to me when your team can score more than 33 points in a game.  
LSU's basketball dynasty is officially over.  Oh, wait a minute.  It never 
began.  

Mississippi 50, LSU 33
		
 
OXFORD, Miss. (AP) _ Aaron Harper scored 16 points to lead No. 25 Mississippi 
to a 50-33 victory over Louisiana State on Wednesday night. 
Harper was the only player in double figures for the Rebels (18-4, 6-3 
Southeastern Conference), who won their fourth consecutive game exactly one 
year after their worst home loss in 40 years _ a 97-53 loss to LSU. 
Roland Dupree had 14 points and a game-high 11 rebounds for LSU (11-9, 1-8), 
which was held to fewer than 40 points for the first time since a 51-39 loss 
at Rice in 1948. 
The Rebels limited the Tigers to 12-of-43 shooting from the field and forced 
them into 25 turnovers. 
LSU also shot just 1-of-16 from 3-point range, but stayed close before the 
Rebels put it away with a decisive 19-4 run. 
LSU led only once, on Dupree's opening basket. Ole Miss answered with a 12-5 
run and never trailed again. Harper made three consecutive baskets to 
highlight the surge. 
The Rebels led 19-15 at halftime, but LSU pulled within 23-22 with 15:19 
remaining on a basket by Jermaine Williams. LSU never got any closer as Ole 
Miss went on its decisive 19-4 run in the next seven minutes. Harper sparked 
the surge with a pair of 3-pointers and two assists. 
LSU's DuPree got a technical foul during the run, following his protest of an 
offensive foul by teammate Torris Bright. 
Jason Harrison hit both technical foul free throws and Harper followed with a 
3-pointer to complete the run and give Ole Miss a 42-26 lead with 7:23 left.

Hey Shanna -

How was your weekend in Louisiana?  Did you and Eric have fun?  I'm emailing
because last weekend I was really sick and had to cancel dinner and dancing.
I went to the doctor and found out I had pneumonia.  I rescheduled dinner
for this Friday, so if you and Eric are free, I would love for the two of
you to come.  Dinner is at Lupe Tortilla at 8:30.  We'll probably go dancing
afterwards!

Let me know if you guys can come.

Take care -

no i haven't driven by yet.  i would like to see the mandell house again 
before putting a contract in on it.

Did you drive by Huldy?  If so, what did you think?

We can do a contract whenever you want.  Did you call B. Dunn?

Talk to you later.  Love, Mom

I am fine with seeing more houses before buying but was thinking that it 
might be a good idea to get the ball rolling on the Mandell house (i.e. low 
ball contract). This does not mean that I am wanting to buy right away, but 
more of testing the market and resolve of sellers.  Let me know when you are 
available to see more houses.  I am free whenever, except for Saturday after 
around 4 pm.

It's been so long since we talked, I don't know what I'm supposed to be
doing.

Just finished real estate school and learned a few things - well, my memory
was refreshed.  Re: precertification for a loan.  A non-committal response
from an online source does not mean that you are precertified.  And, you
must be real careful about all conditions relating to said loan.  Dad thinks
you should call Bob Dunn (call Dad for number.).  Bob is in the mortgage
business and is a good guy to have on your side.  His office is near San
Felipe and Voss.  You should probably get this ball rolling so you are
ready, don't you think?

I am busy today but let me know if you want to see anything Friday.  We
could wait until the weekend to see what's open and make appts. for whatever
else you want to see.  I recommend that you see a few more before making an
offer but that is up to you.

Let me know what I can do.  LU-M

That is fine.  Mom had said that you wanted me to go through Bob Dunn for my

Just thought ya'll would like to know.

And Chad, I'll save you the trouble - Mack Brown is a terrible coach and all 
he can do is recruit.

hey dad.  thanks for the invite but I won't be able to get away for lunch.  
we had a great trip this weekend, its good to live the simple life every once 
in a while.

eric

Good evening. Hope your trip was enjoyable and  safe. I am thinking about 
taking your Mom to Cafe Annie for lunch on Valentine's  Day. You want to 
invite Shanna and join us? Let me know by Tuesday. Have a good  week. Dad

Here is the information on the Texas Gas Desk Plan for 2001.

Thanks

Hi Eric,

2405 Mandell looks really good.  HCAD app. $267500.
2401 Mandell sold on 8/29/00 for $279900 in 6 days.  These are Silvestri
townhomes which I think are a cut above Perry.  HCAD for 2402 (Perry) is
$271800, not much less than asking price.  This is a patio home.  How many
townhomes/patio homes would you estimate are on the street?  Do you want to
try to see 2405 also?  LU-M

Ok, I'm supposed to be getting more XLs today.  If you don't want to trade 
your T-shirt for an XL, please let me know, otherwise leave your T-shirt in 
your chair in case you're not there when I come by.  I'll switch them when I 
get the XLs from our team lead.

Thanks,

Hey Sheila,

Happy Birthday! Shanna and I are going to Louisiana on Friday, so we can't 
make it.  I hope you have fun.

-Eric

Hello everyone -

This Friday some of my friends and I (and Michael of course) are getting
together to celebrate my birthday.  We're starting with dinner at Lupe
Tortilla at 8:30 pm and then most likely going to the Mercury Room.  We
might go to a few other places depending on who wants to do what.  I'm
pretty leniant as long as I get to dance!

I hope you all can make it.

Get off Blanchard's nuts.  Tuberville would leave in a heartbeat.  Hell, 
Auburn is not even Alabama's Flagship University.  Wow, 2nd tier in your own 
state.  I am sure Tuberville never thinks about that fact.

Chad, do you even know what is coming out of your mouth?  When did you become 
such a football expert?  I recall Blanchard and the boys having to teach you 
about the game.  

that is very original of you plove - what have you been doing surfing the OU 
websites

Phillip M Love
01/30/2001 02:32 PM
touchy,touchy.  seems like the frustration of three straight top 5 recruiting 
classes with nothing to show for it are getting to you.  It will be ok.  
Hopefully Mack can get some coaching in their to go with his powers of 
persuasion.

?
READ THIS. LET IT REALLY  SINK IN.? THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU 
START YOUR DAY. 

Michael is the  kind of guy you love to hate. He is 
always in a good 
mood 
and  
always has something positive to say.? When someone 
would ask him  how 
he 
was 
doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would  
be twins!" 

He was a natural motivator.? If an employee was  having 
a bad day, 
Michael 
was there telling the employee how to look  on the 
positive side of the 
situation. 

Seeing this style really  made me curious, so one day I 
went up to 
Michael 
and asked him, "I  don't get it! You can't be a 
positive person all of 
the 
time.  
How do you do it?" 

Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say  to 
myself, you have 
two 
choices today.? You can choose to be in  a good mood 
or...you can choose? 
to 
be in a bad 
mood.?  I choose to be in a good mood.? Each time 
something bad happens, 
I  
can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn 
from it. I choose  
to 
learn from it. 
Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can  
choose to accept 
their 
complaining or...I can point out the positive  side of 
life. I choose 
the 
positive side of life. 

"Yeah,  right, it's not that easy," I protested. 

"Yes, it is," Michael said.  "Life is all about 
choices. When you cut 
away 
all the junk, every  situation is a choice. You choose 
how you react to 
situations. You  choose how people affect your mood. 
You choose to be in 
a 
good mood  or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your 
choice how you live 
your  
life." 

I reflected on what Michael said. Soon hereafter, I 
left  the Tower 
Industry 
to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often  
thought about him 
when 
I made a choice about life instead of  reacting to it. 

Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved  
in a serious 
accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications  
tower.? After 18 
hours 
of surgery and weeks of intensive care,  Michael was 
released from the 
hospital with rods placed in his back.  

I saw Michael about six months after the accident. 
When I asked him  how 
he 
was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. 
Wanna  see my 
scars?" 

I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what  
had gone through 
his 
mind as the accident took place. "The first  thing that 
went through my 
mind 
was the well-being of my soon to be  born daughter, " 
Michael replied. 
"Then, 
as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two 
choices: I could 
choose 
to live or ...I  could choose to die. I chose to live." 

"Weren't you scared? Did you lose  consciousness?" I 
asked. Michael 
continued, "...the paramedics were  great. They kept 
telling me I was 
going 
to be fine. But when they  wheeled me into the ER and I 
saw the 
expressions 
on the faces of the  doctors and nurses, I got really 
scared.? In their 
eyes, 
I read  "he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take 
action." 

"What did you  do?" I asked. 

"Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions  
at me," said 
Michael. 
"She asked if I was allergic to anything.  "Yes, I 
replied." The doctors 
and 
nurses stopped working as they  waited for my reply. I 
took a deep 
breath 
and 
yelled, "Gravity."  

Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to 
live. Operate on  me 
as 
if I am alive, not dead." 

Michael lived, thanks to the  skill of his doctors, but 
also because of 
his 
amazing attitude. I  learned from him that every day we 
have the choice 
to 
live fully.  Attitude, after all, is everything. 
"Therefore do not worry 
about  tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. 

After all today is the  tomorrow you worried about 
yesterday. 

You have two choices now:  
1. Delete this. 
2. Forward it to the people you care about. 

You  know the choice I made. 

he will be taking it soon

Hi Eric,
?
When you move, I assume you will probably buy some  new furniture.? If you 
decide to replace the couch, will you reserve it for  Jason.? Also, will 
Brian be taking this blankety-blank couch from our  garage or should I give 
it to Jason?? LU-M

thanks mom. just let me know

L,

Hi Eric,
?
I called the agent.? He's out of town.? I  left a message on his voicemail?to 
ask someone else in his office to show  it to us.? I'll let you know when I 
hear something.? I have to start  with the listing agent.? Otherwise, the 
commission lines get blurred.?  Talk to you later.? Have a nice day. LU-M

Tell me if you are in on the draft at 10:30.  To draft you need to go to the 
website and click on draft - go to the draft room.

Just as clarification - we start 6 players and have weekly scoring in haed to 
head matchups.  You can chage your lineup before each day's worth of action.  
Your sixth man can be any position.  The draft order will be determind at 
10:30.

Since the NBA season begins tonight, we need to have the fantasy basketball 
draft today @ 10:30 AM. Tell me if this is ok.  If you do not remember the 
rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the 
rules link.

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

We are getting a group together to play paintaball tomorrow at around 10 am.  
We will be playing at Adventure Village (just north of Intercontinental 
Airport on FM 1960).  Their website is www.adventurevillage.com.  The total 
cost should be somewhere between $30-$40 per person ( about $15 for a gun and 
$6 per 100 paintballs).  Let me know if you can make it.

Hey Greg,

I mostly used the review course books.  You are welcome to borrow them if you 
like.  Otherwise, I am sure that either Kaplan or Princeton Review has some 
good books.  Check the AIMR website.

-Eric

   

Bass,

Long time, no talk.  How's it going?  Hope the market is treating you well!

I have a question for you.  I am looking to take the CFA Level I test this 
summer.  I missed out on a review course I wanted to take.  I remember you 
said that you were taking the CFA, and I noticed you had a particular book 
you were studying.  I just wanted to see if you would recommend the book you 
studied.  If so, who produced it.

I saw Kaplan produces one, but I am not sure if it is any good.

I would really appreciate it.

Late,
GM

Tell me if you are in on the draft at 10:30.  To draft you need to go to the 
website and click on draft - go to the draft room.

Just as clarification - we start 6 players and have weekly scoring in haed to 
head matchups.  You can chage your lineup before each day's worth of action.  
Your sixth man can be any position.  The draft order will be determind at 
10:30.

Since the NBA season begins tonight, we need to have the fantasy basketball 
draft today @ 10:30 AM. Tell me if this is ok.  If you do not remember the 
rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the 
rules link.

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

Are you ready for some football!?!?!

I am trying to put together a flag football game this Sunday at 2:30 pm at 
Rice University.  I need YOUR help to pass this e-mail along to as many 
friends that you feel would be interested in friendly, competitive flag 
football.  If you are remotely interested, e-mail me your name and phone 
number, so I can create a contact list to pass out to everyone.  I don't have 
any flags or field cones, but if we get enough people interested, I'm sure 
Enron will sponsor us (if you have flags and/or cones, please bring them; 
I'll bring the football).

The location of our games will be at the practice field, East of the Rice U. 
stadium (across the parking lot).  I believe our playing field is on Rice 
University Blvd., between gates 12 and 13.  The field has two field goals and 
bleachers.  It's hard to miss!

I hope everyone is interested.  If not, we didn't need your slow, lazy, 
unathletic ass anyway...

My contact info is 713-345-7594.

dinner around 7ish will be fine - but we will come  out earlier to help out 
and have drinks

Hi Eric,

I don't think you want to look at it.  Notice that it is just one block from
the railroad tracks.  Talk about noise!

What time do you want to have dinner Saturday night?  I just got back from
the grocery store so everything is ready to prepare.  I will email Shanna
next.  Talk to you in a bit.  LU-M

how do they know that he was sexually molested though?

Brian Hoskins@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS
01/12/2001 10:25 AM
this is the sickest thing I've ever heard

ACCUSED MOLESTER PLEADS INNOCENT IN MONTANA COURT 
   A man accused of sexually molesting a 12-year-old boy, then killing
him and serving his body to his neighbors, has pleaded innocent in a
Great Falls, Mont., courtroom.
   Court records indicate that the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, is a
career criminal. The 43-year-old is being held on half a million
dollars bond.
   Police say they found notes indicating that Bar-Jonah called dinners
cooked for friends and neighbors "little boy stews."
   He could face the death penalty if found guilty of murder and
several other charges, including impersonating a police officer.

[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]

Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road
and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday
morning.

Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after
midnight Monday.

Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are
listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred
as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.

On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.
The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had
burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the
.22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to
the steering wheel column.

After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly
and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling
about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently
overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle
swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.

Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken
clavicle and was treated and released.

"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we
might both be dead" stated Wallis.

"I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a
first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident
happened," said Snyder.

Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs
the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.
Way to go, Lavinia)

This is the Laff Spot on 249 and 1960.  Come up the Beltway and go left on
249.  Exit Greens road and go through two lights.  It will be in strip
shopping center on your right side, about a quarter of a mile past Circuit
City.  It is in the same shopping center as a bar called Frogs Saloon.

Addendum No. 1

To whom it may concern:

It has been brought to my attention that there are some people who are
interested in playing paintball games.  However, we were going to play this
weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to
previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January
20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the
whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs
are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it
would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much
out there.

If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can
decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine!

Thank you,

George Kissamis

No wonder the SEC is able to get good recruiting classes.

i think you guys are going to be responsible for booking your own fare - so 
talk to gary

   

What time are the flights on Fri, Feb 16?  If you can save more money by 
booking one late ... you can book me on a late flight.  I am not sure how 
long the offsite is going to last.  If not, I'll make whatever flight you put 
me on.

Dave

. . pretty funny!

sleigh/snowmobile dinner. They both sound like fun. I have never has a
"snowmobile dinner". Tasty.-Dad

Vietnamese War Refugee Becomes Successful 
Cookbook Author in America

Dulles, VA -- (Xpress Press)-- Successful 
Georgetown clothing designer Diana My Tran, 
celebrates the culture of her homeland in 
THE VIETNAMESE COOKBOOK, an easy-to-follow 
guide to Vietnamese cuisine.

In 1975 Diana Tran left Vietnam as part of 
a mass exodus when Saigon fell to Ho Chi 
Minh's North Vietnamese troops. The pregnant 
20-year-old had no idea where she was going 
or what she would do when she arrived, and 
was forced to make a new life for herself 
in a foreign country.  Over the past two 
decades she has gone from not knowing a word 
of English to being a successful clothing 
designer and dressmaker, with clients in the 
upper echelons of politics, media, and society.

Yet despite her success in America, Diana 
staunchly holds on to her Vietnamese heritage. 
"I want to keep our family heritage alive, es-
pecially for my children.  The easiest way to 
do that is through the food."  She says that 
when she first came to America, she missed the 
many joyous family celebrations and their acc-
ompanying feasts, and tried to recreate them 
for her new friends in America.

"When I first arrived in America, cooking 
Vietnamese dishes was a challenge, because 
there were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA.  
Most of the time I could not find the tradi-
tional ingredients and had to make substitutions, 
but the food turned out just fine," she says. 
Diana recorded all of these substitutions in 
her cookbook, keeping the original tastes and 
textures. The recipes make use of ingredients 
easily found in local supermarkets, and show 
step-by-step instructions for making the healthy 
delights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply.

"My time for cooking is as limited as it ever 
was when I was a new immigrant," Tran says.  
"Traditional Vietnamese food can take time and 
effort to prepare-time I usually don't have, so 
I have created my own easier versions of Vietn-
amese dishes, tailored to the busy American 
lifestyle."

Diana's cookbook has been featured in The 
Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, Charlotte 
Observer, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, and the 
Portland Press-Herald.   Diana has also appeared 
on Fox Noon News in Washington, DC and Poor Man's 
Kitchen in Seattle, WA. She is available for inter-
views about her family's flight from Saigon and her 
American success story.

Hi Jason,
?
Sorry I didn't see your message til late  yesterday.? I've been researching 
our family tree and have been totally  consumed.? I believe I've traced it 
back to 1658 on your Grandpa's  side.? Isn't that fascinating?? I began this 
project for you and Eric  but, in the process, I have become consumed.? It's 
very, very  interesting.? I will organize all of this in the future so you 
and your  brother have it.? Part of the inspiration came from a book Shanna 
gave me  for my birthday.? I started to fill in some of the blanks about our 
family  and couldn't remember what Grandpa had told me.? I was saddened by 
this and  now he is gone and I cannot ask him anymore.? So, I decided to do 
something  about it. Our old family bible from 1853 gave me a good starting  
point.
?
About your resume.? I think it is wonderfully  done.? I spoke with Dad and he 
told me about his comments to you.? I  agree.? There is so much more about 
you that is good.
?
Have a good day and I'll talk to you soon.?  I'm going to copy this to Eric 
so I don't have to write it all over.? Off  to the cemeteries I go!!
?
Love you, Mom
Let me actually attach the file this time  :-)
Would you do me a favor and look this over and  tell me things I should 
change?? Please send it back to this  address.? You can make the changes in 
the document and send the changed  document back.?  Thanks.

maybe this can be our stud LB

have a definitive end date but will let you know when I know for sure.

we would like to meet @ 8 at some Pappasitos (I don't know where you live 
exactly) between you and I.

We will be there.  Name the time and which Pappasitos

(See attached file: JBass Resume.doc)
I made a few changes.  Generally when creating a resume, shorter is better
(preferably fitting on one page).  So most of my changes have been
consolidations.  Also, I tried to make the tenses of all of your bullet
points the same (you want to do this on all resumes and outlines).

As a side note, Shanna and I would like to take you and Donnita to dinner
on Friday at Pappasitos.  Can you make it?

-Eric

Would you do me a favor and look this over and tell  me things I should
change? Please send it back to this address. You  can make the changes in
the document and send the changed document back.   Thanks.

Friday is good.  Depends on everyone else.

   

As always, be flexible...  The lunch conflict I had on Friday was cancelled 
on Friday, so the 12th is now open.  Do youwant to reschedule?  I have a 
meeting that starts @ 1:30 on Friday.  Let me know your thoughts.

   

Maybe we should go to an early lunch or reschedule.

Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
will keep you from attending the meeting.      

Hey Dad,
We would love to meet ya'll for dinner.  Just let me know when. The only 
night we can't is Friday.

Love,
e

Good evening Son. Seems like forever since we have  talked. Hope your week 
was good and next week is better. Lets get together for  lunch or dinner next 
week. Stay in touch. Love  you-Dad

shanna is meeting her family in dallas tomorrow, so she will not be alone.
tim is a friend of mine that went to lsu - i worked with him for about a year 
when i first started.  he had been dating his fiancee during college but they 
had broken up about a year ago.  he had been trying to get back together but 
i don't think he knew that he would get engaged over christmas.  i guess he 
had bought the ring in hopes of popping the question and when things went 
well over christmas he went ahead.

have a fun and safe weekend.

Hi E,

Glad to hear all is well with the exception of Toni, of course.  I am sorry
to hear of her unending heartache.  Tell Shanna I'm thinking of all of them.
Is her mother going to be there?

Which one is Tim?  Did you know he was getting engaged?

Have a good weekend.  Everything is good here.  We're going out tonight and
will meet Ken and Cheryl for dinner tomorrow night.

LU-M
Hey Mom,

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to
Happy Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit
Toni tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than
that, just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that
vacation.

How are things on the homefront?

I am not a market maker in SWA vouchers, so you have my word that I will not 
sell them back.  Your bid for these vouchers is $250 in the market, my bid 
for bulk is $200,  I am willing to pay more.  I can already get to my 
destination for $250 - so maybe we can meet in the middle.

Let me know

DirtyRed2U@webtv.net (David) on 01/05/2001 02:07:42 PM
If you get me for $200--you can sell em to me for $250.

on one airline or another.

I'm up for going to watch it somewhere.  Give me a call on my cell phone

I've received the fund raising envelopes for the flag football tournament.   
I need everyone to pick these envelopes and begin collecting for UT.

I'm at 2918b or you can send me your location and I will  try to use the 
interoffice mail.

Alternatively, you can just solicit on your own without the envelope (which 
makes it more official).   Keep in mind that contributions will be matched by 
Enron and make checks payable to the University of Texas at Austin.  Last 
year we donated about $30 K to A&M Bonfire memorial scholarship efforts.  
Money collected this year will goto the general scholarship fund at UT.

Each team is expected to raise $2000  and we have less than 20 days left, so 
do your part.

---

Also, if anyone is interested in practicing this weekend or next, let me know 
and I will try to arrange it.  Webb's team is not practicing.

Finally, we're still short 2 guy players.

Now I see how you guys have been winning all of your games - through 
cheating.  You are supposed to have at least one player on IR each week.  A 
designated IR player cannot play.  There are no IR moves during the week.  
That means that at least one person on your team should score no points each 
week.

too complicated

   

http://www.gamblingmachine.com/craps/

I have said it 15 times already, but I will say it again.  Texas was 4-7 in 
the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown 
came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo 
and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with 
the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in 
the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound 
familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams 
Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU 
fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year.    
Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say " well that is what 
you say every year"), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his 
first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win 
the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem 
saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.

As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.  
If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec 
was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 
would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb 
powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs.

See ya

Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.  I have a 
question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a 
few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting 
program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in 
LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team 
victories this year.

If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its 
nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and 
PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching 
our TIGER No-Names win.

As Always, its all in Good Fun.

We got a huge commitment today from big Ben Wilkerson, center out of
Hemphill, TX.  He is rated by Rivals as the #1 lineman prospect in the
country, and it is very rare for a center to rate so high on their list.
They keep rolling in; Marcus Spears is expected to announce on Friday.

So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say 
4:30 - 5).  

Tim - let me know if you want me to invite anyone else.

i just explained my logic - despite losing to OU earlier in the year texas is 
actually better than them.

see below

   

	
	                           
	

What was the score of the UT Oklahoma game?

   

i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last 
year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and 
still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the 
game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat 
oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.

get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a 
championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after 
mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same 
next year.

lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a 
couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.

but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team.

great.  he can go there with all the talent in the world and get run by the 
pac-10.

Hi Mom,

Ruth Chris would be nice.  I don't know anything anout Cafe Natalie.  Use 
your judgement.  

We are about to leave for SD.  So I will give you a call from there.  
Don't forget to cheer for the horns and . . .

Hook 'em!

Hi Eric,

I just got the only remaining reservations at RC's but they are at 5.  At
this point, I am sure that it will be next to impossible to get anything
else, anywhere else.  I have been trying to contact a new, local restaurant
near here but their line has been busy.  They do have a prix fixe menu
though, unlike RC's.  Let me know what you want to do.  LU-M  Have a great
trip and be careful.

Have you decided on plans for New Years?  I was thinking about doing a nice 
dinner somewhere (i.e. Ruth Chris).  Let me know.

-Eric

tom is going to be happiest with more money - so whatever nets him more money 
he will be happy with

   

because we have already included it.  (the whole honesty thing kills me 
sometimes). do you think Tom cares?  

   

why not

   

Hey we could get a break.  Jim Coffey just called and is under the assumption 
that our $202 million does not include costs from the Interest Rate group.  
Do you think we should tack on $5 mil and try to run that through?  

that sounds fine - but the zoo is in balboa park as well

   

My thoughts for the trip:

Friday:

Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in San Diego.  Even- if 
you don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take 
at least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
afternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
shopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that 
night- we can walk on the beach!

Saturday:

Visit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in 
the area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there 
is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking 
tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a 
ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del 
Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish 
the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a "lively 
evening street scene" and live music.

What do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
open- if we are interested.

Shanna

why not

Hi Dearest,

Yes, 2001 will be better.  I have an appt. for a complete physical on Jan.
3.  Why don't you call and get your lab work done that day and we'll go for
lunch?

Yes, New Year's Eve sounds good with the boys.  I sent you messages from
both the boys.  Isn't it nice that they, independent of each other, think of
spending New Year's Eve with us?  That makes me feel good.  I can't think of
anybody I'd rather spend the evening with than my wonderful men and the
boys' signficant others.

SWCC would be fine.  Also, Ruth Chris' but that would be pricey.  I had
originally thought that the little Mexican place on 90A could cater some
food.  They're good and I just thought of that place we just read about -
Cafe what's her name on 90A.  But, by far, the easiest and least expensive,
I think, would be SWCC.

Love you, Toot

  Hi Toot. Hope you start to feel better, soon. You have certainly had more
than your share of pain this year. Next year will be better. Saw the e-mail
from Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what we
were doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they were
in any event welcomed to join us. Why don't we put together something simple
with the boys and D and S? We still have that wonderful Champagne from last
year.Maybe we could go to dinner early @ SWCC, then back home for games and
Champagne. Let me know what you think. If that sounds good, I will call SWCC
and find out the details. I am assuming the boys are available. Love you-L

here is what my parents are doing for new years.  SWCC is the country club.  
Let me know if either of the 2 that I have sent you sound interesting.

Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was
visiting Texas from the East Coast:

Recently I was honored to be selected as an outstanding Famous
celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a chili cook-off, because no one
else
wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last
moment,
and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking
directions
to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two
judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and
besides
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
               paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to
put the
               flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
crazy.

Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili

JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
                        seriously.
FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
               supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
people
               who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
               walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on
my face.

Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
               have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by
now.
               Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the

               front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.

Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
                        other mild foods, not much of a chili.
FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to
               taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me
with fresh refills;
               that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like
this nuclear-waste
               I'm eating.

Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding
                       considerable kick. Very impressive.
JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit
                        the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted
               and four people behind me needed paramedics. The
contestant
               seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given
me brain
               damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring
beer directly
               on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the
other judges asked
               me to stop screaming.  Rednecks!

Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice

                       and peppers.
JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.
                        Superb.
FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,
sulfuric
               flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except
big Sally.
               I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!

Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of
chili
                        peppers at the last moment. I should note that I
am worried
                       about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit
of distress
                       as he is cursing uncontrollably.
FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't

                feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and
the world sounds
                like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered
with chili which
                slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of
lava-like stuff to
                match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll
know what
                killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too
painful. Screw it, I'm
                not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just
suck it in through
                the 4 inch hole in my stomach.

Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,
not too bold
                       but spicy enough to declare its existence.
JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor
hot. Sorry
                        to see that most of it was lost when Judge
Number 3 passed out,
                        fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.
Not sure if he's going
                        to make it. Poor Yank.
FRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable To report)

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was
wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered
us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed
our connection we were forced to spend a combined
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose,
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna
Husser, and Donnita Franklin.

Hi Mom,

Where are we staying in Telluride again?  I have been looking at some 
restaurants on telluride.org - it looks like they have some nice places.  
Maybe we should look into doing a sleigh ride or snowmobile dinner outing one 
night.

Can you send me the flight numbers for the America West debacle we just 
experienced?  

Thanks

Mike,

I haven't heard anything, so I am assuming that the tourney is off. I do, 
however, still have the money that I collected for UT.  I would still like to 
turn the money in.  Who should I direct it to.

Thank you for your attention.
May I have your attention, please!!

Just wanted everyone to know that Texas was voted #1 by Playboy magazine for
"Colleges with the Best Looking Girls".  As if we needed affirmation of this
fact...

But, now, we have full-fledged proof to show the world where it's at.

I've never been prouder to say, "Hook 'em Horns!!"

This comes from playboy.com

The List:

1.  The University of Texas
2.  Arizona State
3.  UCLA
4.  University of Florida
5.  University of Arizona
6.  Florida State
7.  University of Alabama
8.  University of Colorado
9.  East Carolina
10. University of Georgia

whatever you think babe - i will trust you to make plans- let's go before 
christmas though

   

The following are the possible dates (that fit into our schedule as far as I 
know) that we could go see The Nutcracker.  Take a look and see what you 
think.

Dec.  16(Sat),  17(Sun), 19(Tues) 20(Wed) OR

we could go after Christmas (but I am thinking that is just not as fun):

Dec 28 (thurs), 29 (Fri), 30(Sat)

Matt,

Thanks for the info.  Do you happen to have the data split out between 
physical and financial trades?

Eric,

The following is a the breakout for the Texas region (Transactions and 
Notional Volume). The breakout is based on deal location and/or Pub code. You 
should also note that the database from which this information is derived is 
based on a "Snapshot" methodology. Each day it queries relevant databases for 
EOL and Non-EOL deals for the prior day and stores them. It does not requery 
the databases for previous days, it therefore will not reflect killed, 
restructured, renegotiated, or originated trades which are booked on a 
post-dated basis.

If you have any further requests please contact Torrey Moorer or myself.

Tom need to know for post HPL projections for potential signees of EOL.

   

	
	                           
	

No, only the execute ID companies can transact.  What are you using this for?

So, do I need to look at those counterparties with a "closed" status to 
determin if they are actually signed up?

Thanks,

Hey Commish,

It appears as though I did not receive points for the Miami Defense (18) or 
Lamar Smith (36) due possibly to the late ending of the Monday night game...  
With the points, I should have 132 and a victory over the Snake Pit... As it 
stands now, I have only 78 points, and a loss in the system... Is there 
anything we can do???

Hey Mom,

Don't Worry about Friday, we ended up going out to eat with Michael and 
Sheila.  Any more news on the watch and $?

I don't think that I am interested in the Grace luncheon, thanks though. 

I am going to Austin this weekend but will be back on Saturday.  Shanna is 
going to Louisiana, so this weekend will be good for the clothes.  Do you 
need a check from Shanna for the airfare?  If so, let me know.

What did you do this weekend?

-Eric

Hi Eric,
?
How was your weekend?? Sorry again about  Friday night.? 
?
Someone from Grace Pres. Church called to extend an  invitation to you and 
Jason for a "singles" luncheon after the 11 o'clock  service on Sunday.? If 
you are interested, call 713-267-5075 for  reservations.? Just thought I'd 
pass that along.
?
I hope we can see you this weekend.? Are you  going to Austin?? We have 
plenty of time to look at the clothes.? She  ought to have a couple of weeks, 
though, if she doesn't like what I  have.
?
Talk to you later.? Have a great day.?  LU-M

Hey Michael,

I just wanted to confirm my position on the team.  I know you have already 
talked to Luis Mena about putting together a team, and I would like to be on 
that team.

Hopefully this year we can practice a little more and take home the 
championship.

To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?

Thanks in advance,

Eric Bass

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Its all about expectations, my man!  What was Texas Ranked at the beginning 
of the season????  I am waiting for CNNSI to come out with a poll on the most 
overrated team of the year---my guess---a pick'em b/w Alabama and Texas.  Any 
time Texas is challenged they "you-know-what" their pants.  

CKL  

   

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

GEAUX TIGERS!

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-

What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a "cushy"  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
Internet" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of
the greatest Presidents of our history."

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

Thought y'all might find this amusing.

I will be there - if you need another guy, let me know.  I know another 
analyst who would play.

time to break out some of the old plays?

This is to those of you who can make the game tonight.  Please try to get to 
the game as early as possible (6:15-6:30) so we can practice a little.

We should have eight pending Luis' friend.

Let me know if anything comes up between now and game time that we prevent 
your attendance.

$0 bids for S Christie, G Anderson, and D Akers
$2 bid for Kevin Johnson
$0 bid for Torrance Small

Thanks

Gary,

We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to 
sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as 
possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the 
forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by 
the end of the week with an acceptable target.

Thanks,

Eric,

I've put a Jan-Mar Hobby $10,000/$2 million swap offer in the market of 635 
HDDs.  635 is the 10 year average.  Given the forecasts for normal to warm in 
the Gulf area this winter - with particular emphasis on warmth in the Jan-Mar 
period - I anticipate that bids will come back, initially, around 560 - and 
that we might be able to sell a swap around 585.  As a frame of reference, 
last year (2000) came in at 412.5 HDDs and 1999 came in at 429.5 HDDs.

What kind of number are you looking for  - do you want to leave an order with 
me where you'd be willing to sell the swap?

If you're interested in buying an option, perhaps you'd like to put a bid out 
on the following structure:

Hobby
Jan-Mar
$15,000/HDD
$2,700,000 Limit
560 strike (1/2 standard deviation from the 10 year average)

I imagine you could get this option for approx. $750,000.  The same option 
with a $2,000,000 limit would go for about $100,000 less.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,
Gary

A vote was taken, and NY,NY was declared the winner.  I then went around to 
everyone and the were cool with NYNY because it was putting an extra $100 in 
everyone's pocket.  If you want to talk to everyone and try and convince 
them, let me know.  By the way, how do I get my high score weekly money?  DO 
I have to wait until the end of the season.

Are we really going to stay at the shithole hotel in Vegas or are you going 
to get rooms at the Bellagio? 

Dan,

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL "Force Majeure" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this 
information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Eric Bass

Hi Eric,

I am really getting worried.  I was sitting down to
send you a message to thank you for the gorgeous
flowers and to tell you that "you are your father's
son".  In the meantime, I received that hillarious
e-card from you.  You guessed it - your father sent me
the very same card!!!  You two are amazing.

Thank you for the card and the flowers.  I love you,
too, and I will ALWAYS be here for you.  Mom

seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=

ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=

disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20

by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=

Enron is a great place to work.

=09
=09BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin=

time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus=

he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this=

week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference=
,=20
but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge=
rs=20
was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20
according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20

=20
=09?? David Rowe, Austin=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma =
got=20
it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in t=
o=20
slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanc=
he=20
was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense=
.=20
Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I=
=20
believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t=
he=20
offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n=
o=20
vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B=
ut=20
none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20
ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth=
er=20
he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20
Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You=
=20
can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is=
=20
inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20
Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah=
an=20
needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to=
=20
step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to =
have=20
the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20
wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20
coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the=
=20
play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On=20
defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and=
=20
the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa=
me=20
blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis=
=20
seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista=
ke=20
or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some=
=20
excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t=
he=20
sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU=
=20
with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20
especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20
tendencies also?=20
=09?? Todd Purl=20
=09
=09BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating =
his=20
play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h=
as=20
done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus=
t=20
using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50=
=20
with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line=
=20
can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei=
ng=20
balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th=
e=20
run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the=
=20
coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten=
=20
after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives=
.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- =
be=20
realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and=
=20
losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has=
=20
said "the other team just wanted it more" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20
Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a=
nd=20
Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? =
Or=20
is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might =
=20
for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20
=09?? Mike Engelman=20
=09
=09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell=
ing.=20
When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und=
er=20
the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams=
=20
like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T=
exas=20
is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20
Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure=
=20
there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with=
=20
everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti=
ng=20
star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b=
e=20
expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h=
e=20
has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th=
e=20
Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have=
=20
all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT=
=20
had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (=
had=20
been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott=
on=20
Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT=
=20
in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop=
e=20
of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over=
=20
Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma=
ke=20
his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership=
=20
among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20
constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20

=09Greg Davis=20
=09
=09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20
thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is=
=20
the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are=
=20
offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20
better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last=
=20
seven games (including this one) we have played against "good" defenses=20
(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible=
.=20
We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank
=09
=09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th=
e=20
country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i=
n=20
the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20
conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag=
e=20
when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20
credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur=
e=20
to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on=
=20
this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa=
s=20
on Saturday!  Thanks,=20
=09?? Lane=20
=09
=09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi=
t=20
more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down=
,=20
and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20
there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20
yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20
plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20
tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20
anymore.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, =
no-=20
huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20
alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo=
r =20
Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford=
, =20
the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense =
=20
did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=
 =20
when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why=
=20
not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20
believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a=
ll=20
would  love to see a consistent running game.=20
=09?? Brian Gannon=20
=09
=09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: "The=
=20
one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau=
se=20
it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against=

=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the dri=
ver's=20
seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas=20
doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear=

hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. F=
or=20
every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fal=

the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. =

greatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it=

last year.=20

too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for=

setting the record straight.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the=
=20
receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely=
=20
coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but=
=20
Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run=
=20
on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance=
=20
to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and=20
opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surel=

he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has=

s=20
Miguel McKay on the football team?=20
=09?? Poorun Patel, Lufkin=20
=09
=09BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the=
=20
pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And=
=20
he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin=
d=20
Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince=
=20
the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make th=
e=20
most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's=
=20
position) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the=
=20
team and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting=
=20
restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recrui=
ts=20
that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4=
=20
years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered =
up=20
by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the=
=20
next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive=20
tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where=
=20
the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would=
=20
guess that it has something to do with getting "senior" performance from=20
underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I=
=20
don't know. What do you think?=20
=09?? Kevin P. McCarthy=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with t=
he=20
schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without=
=20
losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star=
=20
high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr=
om=20
then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1=
0=20
and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving=
=20
corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the=
=20
O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have=
=20
all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will los=
e=20
two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcu=
s=20
Tubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership=
=20
in other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors=
.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the=
=20
offense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland=20
Owls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's=
=20
semi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final=
=20
game. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams? =20
=09?? Tyrance "Duke" Barnett, Garland, Texas=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importan=
tly,=20
their leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack=
=20
Brown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to =
be=20
and play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be=20
outstanding, in my opinion.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the Q=
B=20
situation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of t=
he=20
most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my=20
opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps=
=20
in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can=
=20
say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would=
=20
not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the=20
entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to th=
e=20
level they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB=

Last Sat. night 

I have not verified your math but "championships" prior to the associated 
press do not count b/c there was no governing authority that conferred 
national titles before the AP ( as you will notice the retroactive 
declaration of national champions prior to the early 1930's).

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour" which 
will be paid for by Brian "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

With all of the HYPE surrounding the Big 12 this season....

Nine SEC teams are going to bowls, an unprecedented number of bowl-bound 
teams from a single conference in NCAA history.

We can postpone until the ticker sytem is available.  Just let me know.

Thanks,

Eric -  
We cannot delete meter #3537 from this particular Product Description since 
Products using this product location have already been transacted on 
(including Transaction #33491).   

Therefore, we will need to either create a new location name (what would be

message that the Product description for "HPL/AguaD" has been revised.    
Unfortunately, we are working through some issues with the ticker message 
system, but we have been advised that it will be in place soon.  Are you able

=09 On UT's quarterback rotation:=20
=09
=09 "I don't bother to speculate why they do something or not. They run the=
 same=20
offense with both (Major) Applewhite and (Chris) Simms. I'm sure we'll see =
a=20
good part of Applewhite. I know who our starting quarterback will be, and=
=20
he'll be in there the whole go unless something happens."=20
=09
=09 On OU's running game:=20
=09
=09 "I hope our running game is a factor in this game. We're quite a bit mo=
re=20
confident in our running game because we've emphasized it."=20
=09

e,=20
38-28:=20
=09
=09 "We set the tone early last year and didn't finish the tone. There's no=

=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: I heard rumors that the Royal-Memorial Stadium will one day be the =
=20
largest stadium in terms of seating capacity in the country, seating some =
=20
114,000 folks. What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20
=09 ?? Waxer, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and=
=20
Texas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=
 a=20
good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20
would start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th=
en=20
the focus would turn to the south end.=20
=09?
=09
=09

=09Kalen Thornton =20
=09
=09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20
=09?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=
 Carl=20
Reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron=
=20
would be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas=
=20
wants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20
Thornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20
considering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv=
e=20
tackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see=
=20
playing time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future =
by=20
holding him out this season.=20
=09
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=
 =20
second half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question=
=20
about the punt team.=20
=09
=09It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call "fair catch=
." I=20
first noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that=
=20
making an early tackle by  invading the "halo" and receiving a 5-yard penal=
ty=20
is much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.
=09
=09But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po=
p the=20
receiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would=
=20
make that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t=
he=20
penalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor=
th=20
and give that returner something to remember for next time.=20
=09
=09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that=
=20
against a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20
Allen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the=
=20
5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl=
ick.=20
Did something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I=
=20
am out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20
=09?? Jerry Secrets=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g=
ame.=20
The running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking=
=20
angles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl=
ay=20
side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the=
=20
team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last=
=20
Saturday, it did.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20
=09?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s=
till=20
seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h=
e=20
and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi=
gh=20
ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o=
ne=20
wants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return=
=20
was premature.=20

=09Josh Heupel =20
=09
=09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar=
y can=20
answer the call? =20
=09 ?? Marty Wagner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=
s.=20
UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20
secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20
=09
=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=
s=20
back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=
=20
free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=
=20
in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=
=20
possible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20
D-backs.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the =
keys?=20
=09?? Sara Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=
ys=20
the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=
=20
Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=
=20
of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=
er=20
picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex=
as,=20
do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=
?=20
Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=
),=20
do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=
e=20
IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20
=09
=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=
=20
Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =
he=20
obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=
ck=20
at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=
't=20
seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20
=09 ?? Clint Mickey=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=
ons=20
with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20
doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=
t=20
or all of the next two games.=20
=09
=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=
=20
because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=
=20
be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=
 all=20
about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=
=20
Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20
having two starting quarterbacks.=20
=09
=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=
 had=20
been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=
t=20
player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=
he=20
best QB on your own team.=20
=09
=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20
continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20
season. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms=
=20
gets injured.=20

=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Major Applewhite =20
=09
=09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi=
te=20
has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. =
It=20
has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks "starters" and insist on=20
token starts for Chris Simms.=20
=09
=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=
 THE=20
starter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead=
=20
of allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w=
ho=20
then plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =
As=20
fine as Simms' =20
=09
=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=
=20
realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi=
on=20
of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=
d=20
half against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20
rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20
maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=
nt=20
success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=
d=20
is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20
superior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really=
=20
hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =
=20
=09?? Chad Dieterichs=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w=
ay=20
too much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20
matter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses=
=20
onto Stockton's pocket?=20
=09
=09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t=
hat=20
they use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams=
=20
are prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit=
=20
special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20
veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20
=09
=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=
o=20
have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He=
=20
said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=
as=20
the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the=
=20
assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=
gh=20
the middle of the line.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re=
alize=20
what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20
wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20
O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20
=09
=09Guess what? Most of these "great" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=
 a=20
freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=
th=20
current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =
or=20
two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no=
=20
biggie.=20
=09
=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=
ill=20
it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=
=20
programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=
=20
we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20
direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=
=20
true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20
=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=
t.=20
The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=
s=20
has to have experience, and there have to be some "Braveheart"-type leaders=
=20
on the team.=20
=09
=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=
=20
seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=
=20
So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=
=20
couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=
=20
championship.=20
=09
=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=
stead=20
of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=
=20
Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=
as=20
will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20
=09
=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20
included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20
State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20
recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=

the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =

=09
=09
=09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha=
ve=20
the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at=
=20
NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=
al=20
help? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel=
=20
guilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20
=09?? Arland Bishop=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating =
back=20
to a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak =
in=20
the nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20
=09
=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =
The=20
only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games=
=20
are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=
do=20
in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=
e=20
Field.=20
=09
=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=
 be=20
another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20
obviously on the horizon.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=
d=20
this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=
=20
early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=
).=20
They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20
barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=
=20
and let him do his magic.=20
=09
=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=
ore=20
balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=
ly=20
and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=
=20
=09
=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=
m.=20
The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=
ht=20
when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=
=20
straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=
at=20
least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=
=20
probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=
=20
in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=
=20
far).=20
=09
=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=
 has=20
done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20
Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20
one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=
 -=20
his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=
e=20
shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=
k=20
with him. =20
=09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=
fic=20
situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=
=20
that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=
=20
used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=
n=20
do a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go=
ing=20

=09
=09He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know. He has reshaped the=

=20
football team. Games are selling out. Players are coming to Austin. The kid=
s,=20
for the most part, are good kids.=20
=09
=09There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega=
tive=20
voices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made=
.=20

=09 BROWN:  UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team=

worse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea=

=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=

been getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii=

game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in=
=20
the U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high=

=09
=09I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge=
tting=20
drilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems=
=20
like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20
something negative to heap on the program.
=09
=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =
his=20
coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=
h=20
the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted=
=20
about their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do=
=20
you have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20
=09?? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth=
ing=20
up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20
storybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t=
oo=20
big of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t=
o=20
burst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20
re-evaluated and said, "Wait, they really aren't that good."
=09
=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=
n the=20
star falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan=
t=20
to add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =
in=20
the foundation to bring up.=20
=09
=09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat=
e and=20
then when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some=
=20
bad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20
itself. But inevitably there is a settling period.
=09
=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we=
=20
believed will calm down and there will be another story to cover. Plus, Tex=
as=20
may get hot, win all of its games, and then this brief bout of criticism wi=
ll=20
have been for naught. But sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h=
is=20
team. He can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going. We'll=

here. =20

=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms would have benefited from a redshirt year? =
I=20
realize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not an=20
option, but I look back at Major Applewhite and it appears to me he benefit=
ed=20
from a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn the=20
system. When he came in as a redshirt freshman, he was ready to go. Thanks=
=20
for your insightful newsletter. =20
=09?? Michael R. Johnson, Houston, Texas =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Sure, I think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless =
they=20
are Michael Vick. There was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo=
r=20
Simms, however. Simms wants to spend just four years in college, and UT=20
coaches needed a backup for Applewhite. There is no question Applewhite=20

=09
=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=
em=20
with our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim=
=20
Nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20
coming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =
of=20
having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=
=20
both Marshall and UT.=20
=09
=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=
=20
concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=
=20
but does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20
country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=
ne=20
recruits we have committed for next year?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=
he=20
offensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's=
=20
time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching=

=09
=09 Q: I live in Odessa and I use to see Roy Williams do punt returns. Why =
not=20
let  him return some punts?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un=
til=20
at least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20
freshmen anymore. So, perhaps after mid-season, if UT is not making any=20
progress on punt returns, we'll see some new faces back there. I would love=

to see what Williams can do, although I doubt that coaches would put him ba=

=09
=09 Q: Before the UT/Oklahoma State game, I thought that Mack Brown would s=

of two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of=

consistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I=

the game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,=

=20
even wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=
 =20
in until late in the game.=20
=09
=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=
=20
early performance? Or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv=

Applewhite the reigns? It certainly appears that the coaches have more=20

he hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=

rely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=
ir=20
own theories about having two starters.=20
=09
=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =
you=20
say you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=
w=20
only have one starter. I think the coaches will continue to say they have t=
wo=20
starters and play Simms out of fear of an injury affecting Applewhite. I=20
don't know if that's the right answer. Applewhite grew on the job without a=
ny=20
game training before Richard Walton went down in 1998. So who knows?=20
=09
=09I would think the coaches will again rotate after the OU and Colorado ga=

because they will face teams (Missouri, Baylor, Texas Tech and Kansas) that=

they will probably be favored to beat. At that point, if you're UT, you jus=

What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job 
- mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool 
of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think 
that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.

I received an invitation in the mail to purchase Rockets tickets online 2 
days earlier than they go on sale to the general public.  The opener is Tues 
10/31 at 7:30 PM vs. the T-Wolves.    I know how much you guys like sitting 
in the cheap seats, so you can listen to comments such as "I'm gonna let you 
hear it-AIRBALL!," and "He just made Sportscenter."  If you want to go to the 
game let me know  and I will buy the tickets this week.

and none of them are good :-)

With all of the HYPE surrounding the Big 12 this season....

Nine SEC teams are going to bowls, an unprecedented number of bowl-bound 
teams from a single conference in NCAA history.

3 of us are going up Friday and we are staying with a friend of one of the 
guys in the group.

Hi E,

I'm glad to see you are having a good time with your friends.  How many are

Thanks

Jason seemed excited about the concert.  I think  this is one of his favorite 
bands.  I enjoy their music as well but not to the same degree as my eldest 
sibling.  
I am actually going to Dallas on Friday for the TX-OU game.  I am taking a 
couple of friends from work, so it should be a good time ( it always is).

Hi E,

Well, I'm thinking about voting for Gore - NOT!  I will, however, not
mention another word re: election.

Everything else is fine here.  I talked with Jason today to wish him a happy
26th.  He was online with Ticketmaster and got last minute tickets in the
front row of the "pit".  He's very excited.  Do you like the group he's
going to see?  I'm not familiar with them.

How is work?  Are you going to Austin this weekend?  Tell Shanna to have a

That's o.k. As a postscript though, I bought  your Dad a new Marine

Disregard the bills that your recieve from Blockbuster.  I will pay the late

How are things otherwise?

Good Morning, Eric-
?
I assume you received my message yesterday but were  too busy to respond.? 
That's o.k.? As a postscript though, I bought  your Dad a new Marine 
sweatshirt so you can keep the other one.? And, I got  another bill from 
Blockbuster for late fees.? Perhaps it would be best if  you get your own 
account.? Have a wonderful day.   LU-M

yes, it will be there all season

Same place? Either way, I'm there...

I think that despite all of the ballyhoo about Simms ( and I know you hate 
this), Applewhite should play.  I think if Applewhite plays and we have a 
decent running game, we can blow them out.  Our defense is good enough to 
shut pretty much anyone down.

When are you going up and what are ya'll doing up there?

I sure am glad (make that hope) that Hodges doesn't see the field too much.

A salesman from New Jersey pulled off the highway to get gas in Tyler, TX
recently and wandered into town to soak up the local culture. He noticed a
'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating
it. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearing
firemens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,
he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the lady
behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,
"You Yankees never do read the Bible!" He assured her that he did, but simply
couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible
from behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbed
her finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says right
here, "The three wise men came from afar."

 

can't do it - for one I don't have curtis martin and for two fred taylor has 
no value right now - propose something for someone I have

Fred Taylor and Jamal Anderson for Curtis Martin, Travis Prentice and Quadry

I forgot, I offered you Toomer and Garner for Terrell and Jackson - if you 
still want to do that then that is fine - if not look at the deal below.

My deal on the other side fell through - so what do you think about Garner, 
Toomer, and Schroeder for Terrell and Rice

Seriously though, I will be happy to contribute.

Hi everyone,

I will be *walking to cure diabetes* on November 5th, and was hoping each of 
you could donate on my behalf.  As is written below, 84% of all donations to 
JDF go directly to diabetes research.  Wouldn't you feel good about giving to 
such an efficient organization and honorable cause?  I'm sure you all need a 
tax write-off too, right? :)  You can use a copy of your canceled check for 
tax purposes.  

Also, if you donate $25 or more, you will get an Enron JDF T-shirt.  Of 
course, donations of any amount will be greatly appreciated.  Feel free to 
forward this message to others who might be interested in donating, as well.

I will be making the rounds next week to get a head start on collecting, so 
please email me if you'd like to contribute and bring a check made payable to 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.

Thanks in advance for your participation!

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Ladies & Gentlemen,

The BCS may have screwed up the match ups but that won't stop the annual 
College Bowl Pool from taking place.  The attached spreadsheet contains the 
rules and a pick sheet.  For the veterans the rules are the same as last 
year.  The entry fee is $25.  Money and picks are due Monday December 18th.

=09?? Bob Nance=20
=09
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the=

Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more=20
carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness=20
needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought =
he=20
was running tentatively.=20
=09
=09Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut =
loose=20
this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three=20
games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week=

is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to =
do=20
it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yar=

per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,=

=09?? Reggie Reeves=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the=
=20
nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT =
is=20
fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game=

=09
=09Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The=
=20
Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.=20
Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles=
=20
to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,=
=20
the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love=
=20
him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.

=09
=09
=09 Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited abou=
t=20
this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the=20
football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied=
=20
that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but=
=20
they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the seas=
on=20
with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it =
is=20
still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caug=
ht=20
up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.=20
=09
=09Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT =
going=20
8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. Th=
ey=20
are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against=
=20
really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient=

this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my=
=20
days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em! =20
=09?? Larry, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's sh=
own=20
this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third=20
possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two=
=20
guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to g=
o=20
untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.=
=20
=09
=09This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has b=
een=20
sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected=
=20
cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman=
=20
Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett=
er=20
in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while=
=20
for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,=
=20
however, may be too late against a good team.=20
=09
=09The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line t=
o=20
have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that=20
appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory=

(Derrick Dockery). =20

Major Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.=20
=09
=09Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series befor=
e=20
Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep=
=20
pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,=
=20
he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.=20
Johnson, the safer choice. "It was the smarter thing to do," he said.=20
=09
=09My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing ti=
me as=20
possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come=20
Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the=20
coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20
hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, wi=
ll=20
Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coach=

s=20
and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think wh=
at=20
is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.=20
=09 ?? A "Major" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is=
=20
constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20
time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20
everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20
=09
=09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be=
=20
allowed to =20

her=20
Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20
deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20
=09
=09It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's =
a=20
breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent=20
completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB=
=20
rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25=
7=20
yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But=
=20
Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what=20
Simms can do.=20

=09
=09
=09 Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?=20
=09?? Sara McFadden=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability th=
is=20
season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20
could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h=
e=20
lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20
offense. But it's almost impossible to know.=20
=09
=09The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid.=
 It=20
is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and=
=20
break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being "the=
=20
man" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked=
=20
onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play=
=20
QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.=20
=09
=09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20
coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for=
=20
more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide=
d=20
to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense throug=
h=20
three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor=
e=20
passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=
 7=20
in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in=
=20
2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 =
to=20
1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20
=09
=09I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were all=
owed=20
to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h=
e=20
got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20
production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this=20
rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20
this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a=
ll=20
season long. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing=20
defenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the=
=20
offense too complex so that they don't know their assignments  or are they=
=20
simply being outplayed? =20
=09 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The offensive linemen, quarterbacks and coaches all say that th=

=20
Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive=
=20
schemes that they had shown in previous games.=20
=09
=09Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating =
UT,=20
so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against=

Stanford, UT wasn't good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to =

=09?? James Taglienti=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Madden is someone I consider UT's secret weapon. He's much more=

a coach for this team. He works their bodies and minds and can be credited=
=20
with getting this team to believe that it could beat Nebraska back in 1998.=
=20
The players love and respect him even though he works them to the ground.=
=20
None of the breakdowns so far this season can be attributed to Madden.=20

Texas could go unbeaten the rest of the way and beat an undefeated and No. =

d=20
he have beat out Chris or possibly Major Applewhite as the main guy?=20
=09?? Brett Holmes=20

=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I think Hodges Mitchell is a good kid, with a good pedigree ... and=
=20
there's the rub. Is Coach Brown too in love with this kid? Is he doing an o=
ld=20
friend a favor by keeping this kid in the game? He had a decent season last=
=20
year, especially coming out of the shadow of Ricky Williams, but I have see=
n=20
nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.=20
=09
=09I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical "scat-back=
,"=20
Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a=
=20
quick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.=
=20
Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the=20
"vision" required of a good running back? I cannot believe that he is that=
=20
much better than the other running backs on the roster. Are the rest that=
=20
bad? There has to be more to the story.=20
=09?? Roy Cassas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mitchell apparently needs to be pushed to the brink of losing h=
is=20

ob=20
to Victor Ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to 1,300 yards=
=20
rushing and 300 yards receiving. He says he is ready to cut loose, again (i=
n=20
the fourth game, just like last year).  The problem is, Texas is playing=20
Oklahoma State this week, who has the nation's No. 1 defense against the ru=
n.=20
Last year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149=

yards. We'll see if he can shake the slump he's in. Otherwise, look for Ike=

=09
=09 Q: In your most recent "Inside UT Football" you mentioned that stations=

another suggestion for people such as me who live in other parts of the=20
country, or overseas. I have found that all (I think) NCAA top 25 broadcast=
s=20
are carried on http://sports.yahoo.com/. They carry all NFL radio broadcast=
s=20
as well. One of the beauties about this site is that if you don't like one=
=20

=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Why does Coach Mack Brown reject criticism with cynicism, yet accept=
=20
praise with zeal? To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while=20
citing fans as "... being negative and openly critical ..." (i.e., four=20
losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB=20
controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,=
=20
Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites=
=20
the team's emotional psyche as "... being fragile," yet Coach Brown fueled=
=20
this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.=
=20
=09
=09Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's=
=20
mental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown's tenure paralleling the turbule=
nt=20
and volatile path taken by rival coach Jackie Sherrill at Texas A=02?(no eg=
os in=20
that one!) during the 1980s? =20
=09?? David Newburn=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to=
 help=20
his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20
sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds=
=20
them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question=
s=20
the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ=
e=20
and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I=
=20
honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light=
=20
that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He=
=20
forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20
people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or=
=20
worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see=
=20
Stanford).=20
=09
=09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public=
=20
appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio=
n=20
to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his=
=20
team. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the=
=20
first to pick up the team when it's down. Not pile on.=20
=09
=09But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, get=
s 10=20
penalties and gives up another blocked punt for a TD. There is no question =
he=20
is still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at Texas.=
=20
When his team loses a game it shouldn't and plays terribly in doing so, he=
=20
will always hear it from the fans and the press, whether his team is young =
or=20
not.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Why do you suppose the Longhorns are throwing so few really long pas=
ses=20
this year? It seems to me doing so would open up the running game like it w=
as=20
when Ricky Williams was playing.=20
=09?? Will Vernon=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  They need some more time. The young receivers need a little mor=
e=20
time to adjust. But I do think that with the athleticism of the young=20
receivers, you will see more short routes that turn into long gains. Once R=
oy=20
Williams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson develop some comfort in this offens=
e,=20
I think you'll see more long pass plays.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I just have two questions that have been frustrating for me this yea=
r.=20
The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting t=
o=20
have an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes, but=
=20
why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why do=
es=20
Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20
=09
=09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t=
he=20
kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but=
=20
his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a=
=20
gamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant=
=20
minutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20
=09
=09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?=
=20
Hampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your=
=20
All-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn't=
=20
they push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?=20
=09?? Jeff Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Brown trusts Mitchell not to get tight and muff a punt return i=
n=20
front of 80,000 people. That's not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I=
=20
would like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he=
=20
can do. Vasher has been fearless in everything I've seen him do. Mitchell=
=20
hasn't shown breakaway moves yet. If we don't see it soon, it might be time=
=20
to give someone else a shot.=20
=09
=09They take Hampton out on nickel situations because they think that Shaun=
=20
Rogers is the better pass rusher from the tackle position. There has been n=
o=20
talk about moving Rogers to end in pass-rush situations. =20
=09?

I received this email and wanted to share the photo.

Beautiful but sad.

This awsome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska  by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he
was working  while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it
so he  should  at  least be recognized as the photographer of this once
in a lifetime shot.

your choice of anderson or watters   and  taylor

touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 
15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good 
all year.
My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.

Let me know

The third highest because of one Extraordinary week...  My "Shitty"
receivers have outscored Toomer, he blows this year, I have no need for
another blow hard receiver.  Jeff George has the same value as last week..
Johnson is injury prone and one game will not make up for the last 3.  He
will falter again.

alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone
player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you
can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring
back in the league) will still be there.

No thanks.  I will shop.

the most reserve points.

Plove is going to go to Dallas.  We are going to leave next Friday when he 
gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.  The game is at 11 in the morning, 
so we will come home directly after it.  Plove says he has a friend who has a

Do you want to go?

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.

I just now saw it.  It looks like a great gift (more from a daughter than a 
son).  I will look at it when it comes.

   

Ok- since you finally asked-

It is this book entitled "The Story of a Lifetime- A Keepsake of Personal 
Memoirs".  

Here is the description that was given:

"Give this book to someone whose story you want to know . . . It invites the 
reader to share memories, facts, philosophies, beliefs, knowledge, and wisdom 
gained from a lifetime of experience.  Hundreds of questions encourage 
thoughtful reponses.  When complete, it's a priceless heirloom for future 
generations."

I thought it was a neat gift idea- so that your mom can share her thoughts 
with you, and you (your children, your children's children) would have them 
when (unfortunately) she is not around anymore.

I ordered one for my mom also.

Hopefully it will be as neat as it sounds.

I don't know, babe.  What did you get?

   

I ordered your mom a present yesterday.  It should get here before her 
birthday- I would think- because they said it was in stock.  Anyway- I didn't 
know if you had her anything yet or not- but your welcome to give it to her 
if you want-  I just read about it- and thought it would be something that 
she would enjoy- and that you might enjoy giving to her.   But- like I said- 
I ordered it on-line- so I haven't been able to examine it in person- but 
sounded really neat.

Shanna

99 volume reserve for entex (schedule c)

   

I can only think of the Storage Puts and the Desk Mgmt fee ($120,000) as 
prudencies still out there.  Is there any others you might remember?

Dave

You can only pick up players for the upcoming sunday's game through the 
bidding process.  No pick ups will be allowed after wednesday on any given 
week.

If you want to pick up a player - you need to let me know by today - b/c I 
will be on vacation tomorrow.

Did we ever decide on the whether to change to the owner's club or not?

that bid won't be there next week :(

I am going to play with Taylor one week.  I have been waiting this long.  I
know I am blowing a real good deal, but I will come to you next week, after
I see what he can do.

have you decided?  I am not trying to rush you - but I am leaving early
today for Austin - so I need to set my lineup before I leave!

Let me know

That sounds viable.  Give me a little time to mull it over.  I commend you
decent offer :)

walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that
is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he
does.

now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either
watters, anderson or george?

I need to know fairly quickly

I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than
Watters thus far this season.

Jason Bass

what about toomer, garner , prentice and either wesley walls or tony
gonzalez for taylor and watters?

Eric,

Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him
up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing
except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson

Did you mean to trade Bledsoe for Mack?

Have you bought any new DVD's recently?  If so, which ones?

Don,

Here is the information that you requested.  My resume is updated up to my 
last rotation (Risk Mgmt).  My current rotation is in Texas Gas Trading and 
my supervisor is Tom Martin.  My supervisor in Risk Mgmt. was Brenda Herod.

Let me know if you need anything else.

=09
=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2=

=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=

is=20
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=

best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=

=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=

Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=

to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=

=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=

ng=20
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=

=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=
=20
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=
=20
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=

lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=
=20
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=
=20
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=
rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=
ns=20
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=
=20
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=

because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,

just to let you know - s. davis is worth much more than taylor and m. 
robinson is worth much more than george (even if george is starting).

For Stephen Davis and Marcus Robinson, I will give you Taylor and George.

You are going to say no to this and I know this, but in 2-3 weeks we will
revisit the offer.

that's great!
what do you want for taylor?

Let me quote from another source how I feel about trading Taylor.

"Let me get this right: You've waited three weeks for Taylor to get
healthy,
perhaps costing you a win or two, and now you want to trade him? No. Even
if
you think Taylor's going to get hurt again this year (that's a fairly safe
assumption), this is not the time to trade him. Get him in the lineup this
week and keep him there for a couple of weeks. Then, once his value has
maxed out again, that's the time to consider trading him. By that point,
you'll be offered a whole lot more than Anderson and Dudley."

Now, this does not mean I am unwilling to trade or barter, but I will treat
Taylor as the top 5 running back that he is and I will value him as such.
If that is an arena you want to trade in let me know and I will see what we
might be able to do.

Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback 
 Sept. 19, 2000
By Len Pasquarelli
SportsLine.com Senior Writer
 

Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter 
interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their 
starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, 
SportsLine.com has confirmed. 

"If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not 
the case," coach Norv Turner said. "But it goes beyond just the quarterback 
position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general." 

   
Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the 
unbeaten Giants.(AP)   

In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday 
night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for 
the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of 
the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in 
scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. 

A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson 
has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth 
quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or 
his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that 
it might be time for a change. 

One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to 
throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have 
only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 
yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to 
tailback Stephen Davis. 

The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both 
starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 
yards per catch this season. 

But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at 
this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new 
focus more than a new starter. 

"There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said. "Right 
now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere 
else." 

 

Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 09/19/00
Sepculation is increasing that George may get a chance to start after Brad
Johnson struggled against Dallas. The rifle-armed QB may put a jolt into the
Washington offense if he indeed gets a chance to start.

:)

Please forward to the owner of Brad Johnson.

Is everyone making it or do we need more people??

   
	
	

We have a game tonight at 7:00.  Please try to make it to the field by 6:30.

I don't know what he is going to do.  I hope that they start Simms, not 
because Applewhite is bad but because Simms needs some time to develop.  
Although, I think that Mack is going to stay with his 2 QB system because of 
pride.

I was sweating in the 3rd qtr. when we were down 17-14.  What do you think 
they'll do about the QB situation?

I do have to say, our QB question has definitely been answered.  I just hope 
our defense can hold up.  The Tech and Colorado games should be good guides.

   

now, now - you didn't look that great against UTEP.  we will see what happens 
once we settle on a qb

I will tell you that it will have to be an offer that I can't refuse.  You

What do you want for Taylor?

i was looking at brio vista and jeffreys - i was thinking jeffreys but let me 
know
I was thinking we would have an "organized dinner" on Friday and catch 
something on the way back from the game on Saturday (since it is late).
Let me know

-e

I will make reservations for dinner today. I sent Dad the info on
restaurants yesterday but I forgot to ask him which one to reserve.  There
is one near the hotel -Brio Vista - and two downtown - Jeffrey's and Louis
106.  I'll talk to him and get back with you.  Dinner Friday night, correct.
Are we on our own Saturday?  LU-M

Hi Eric,

Dad suggested that we meet at the hotel on Friday and stop at Katy Mills on
the way home on Sunday.  What do you think?  Let me know what time you
expect to arrive in Austin.  You will probably get there before us so just
leave a message at the desk or call us on the car phone.  Have a great day.
We look foward to spending the weekend with you and Shanna.  LU-M

 "Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student"

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, "What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?"  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  "Little Hitlers," they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, "Heil
Hitler" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those "littlest" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.

  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing "It's Not Easy Being  Green."

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as "Temperatures of the 80's"

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome." Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his "fair share."

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,"

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of "fairness" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

Lessons of the Geese

This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
"V" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.

FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an "uplift" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a "V" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.

FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.

FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.

FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.

FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

Dog bites threaten home insurance
Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive

Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News

MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other 
dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    "Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate," said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    "Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly."
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to "pain and suffering" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    "We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers," 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    "Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up."
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    "It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem," said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    "I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat."
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    "More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them," he said.
    "But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    "People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing."
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles "quite a 
few" dog bite claims and he has seen "a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood."
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    "There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs," Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    "For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm," said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    "We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite," Carroll said. "But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    "The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on

Hey Aunt Bonnie,

I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last 
time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the 
coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.

Love,

Eric

Hi Eric,

I really enjoyed my visit to Texas.  It was great
seeing you and meeting Shanna.  You have grown into a
fine young man and I'm proud of you.  I hope to see
you again maybe next year. Keep in touch.

Love   Aunt Bonnie

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

why don't you just make the payment to them this month and we will set up the 
arrangement next month when you have your new job

Also,  I have been meaning to talk to you.  We agreed to terms on the TV,
but I wanted to ask something Aaron's rents gave me a 4 day Window to pay
between the 18th and 22nd and as you know at this moment in time I am living
paycheck to paycheck.  I am going to have a much higher paying job within
the next month but for now I am asking that you too can give me that Window.
For instance, my next check comes on the 20th and If I am due on the 18th ,
I will be late.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.  So, I need to buy you and 
Mom tickets.  Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe 
Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.  If not, we can get some through a 
ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better 
way).

you better shape or other players are going to jump ship to the mullets.  i 
am noticing a recurring theme here in our fantasy leagues - first the gangsta 
and now marcus.

It takes a special kind of player to hang in South Central LA... Not that 
Marcus isn't special, he knows this is a business... Thrill

   

Marcus Robinson was just telling me how much he likes his new digs compared 
to TKC.  He loves Tijuana.  

What kind of show are you running over there?

you have to like garcia against carolina over brunell against balt or bledsoe 
against njy ...  don't you?

Na man, I'm thinking of starting Brunell this week, although I don't know how 
he will fare against a tough Baltimore defense... Bledsoe is going against 
the Jets in Tuna bowl XXX... 

   

How about Garcia and Bettis for Brunell?

I like Bledsoe since I have T. Glenn now, but I could also keep Brunell if 
McCardell is available... Quadry and/or Garner...

   

Brunell or Bledsoe - which one are you willing to trade and for what?  I 
could give a rb and a WR

So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You 
write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  

You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made 
to me on October 18th, 2001).
Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I 
cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any 
exceptions for you.

Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.

he can go - hoskins already has to buy a ticket - he just will need to buy a

Val would like to go if someone needs to back out (it won't be me this time) 
or if there are tickets still available.

Bush vs. the Press
A Washington adage holds that a politician commits a "gaffe" when he
inadvertently tells the truth. This is how we read George W. Bush's
off-the-record aside that New York Times reporter Adam Clymer is a "major
league" you-know-what.

In that refreshingly incautious remark caught Monday by an open microphone,
Mr. Bush was admitting, albeit unintentionally, that his campaign has a
press problem. We aren't referring only to Mr. Clymer, whose performance
review has been ably undertaken by neo-liberal journalist Mickey Kaus at
kausfiles.com. We're talking about the general media double standard faced
by every prominent conservative politician.

As Democrat-turned-journalist Michael Barone has observed, the mainstream
media aren't pro-Democratic. They will sometimes take a Democrat to task,
especially if he violates a media shibboleth such as "campaign-finance
reform." But they are reliably anti-Republican. That is, in newsrooms across
the land there is noticeably greater skepticism, and often animosity, toward
politicians who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the scope
of federal power.

This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks. Instead the
slant shines through in the press pack's definition of what constitutes news
or the interpretation the pack puts on news. Consider the treatment of three
recent campaign episodes:

When Mr. Bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher was
"Christ," he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to the
"religious right." The implication was that he couldn't possibly mean it.
But now Democrat and liberal Joe Lieberman is making a much more frequent
and vocal issue of his own religious faith, and the same media that scolded
Mr. Bush are writing long, thoughtful treatises on the role of religion in
politics. And any criticism of Mr. Lieberman is accompanied with the caveat
that the Orthodox Jew really is sincere. This is a double standard.

Or take Mr. Bush's recent decision to run a TV spot attacking Mr. Gore's
credibility. This was reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, as
going "negative," primarily as a response to Mr. Gore's rise in the polls.
But what about the weeks-long TV-ad hammering that Democrats have laid on
Mr. Bush -- for his Texas record, and even during the GOP convention on his
running mate's 15-year-old voting record? The Gore attacks were reported as
legitimate subjects of political debate. We happen to think all of these are
legitimate, but only Mr. Bush's got the good-housekeeping media's "negative"
label.

Then there is the debate over Presidential debates. This back and forth is a
hardy perennial, and you'd think the press would merely let both sides duke
it out. But in the coverage we've seen, Mr. Bush's proposal to break from
the Commission on Presidential Debates mold is being treated as an attempt
to dodge debates or attract a smaller audience. Mr. Gore's decision to
renege on his pledges to debate on NBC's "Meet the Press" and CNN's "Larry
King Live" don't get the same spin.

This criticism of Mr. Bush is especially galling when it comes from the
likes of ABC and CBS, who now whine that they won't carry debates held by
other networks. So much for their public-spiritedness. Their reaction shows
that the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate voters
and more about dividing the commercial TV spoils equally. We hope Mr. Bush
sticks with his desire to have a less scripted, more open exchange with Mr.
Gore.

Mr. Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's media
problem better than most other Republicans. Indeed, we've long suspected
that his "compassionate conservative" theme was as much about media
management as policy. It was designed to deflect the inevitable media
portrayal of any Republican as a heartless, Gingrichian budget cutter. Mr.
Bush also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him about
rumors of youthful drug use.

We aren't suggesting that Mr. Bush should get into a pitched battle with the
press corps, and especially not with any one reporter. Our point is that Mr.
Bush won't be able to count on even-handed media coverage to carry his
battle to Mr. Gore. He's going to have to make his case directly, and not
too subtly, to voters over the heads of the media.

That means Mr. Bush would be better off doing more debates in several
forums. And, above all, it means setting his own agenda and strategy, no
matter if ankle-biters in the press corps call it "negative."

What time is the game?

   

http://marriotthotels.com/marriott/AUSDT/

I got a Bed and Breakfast for Friday Night with one King Size Bed.  It will 
be nice and cozy for the six of us.

Just kidding - this is a pretty nice place - we have 2 dbls and the hotel is 
in between the stadium and 6th street.  (11th street).

the rate is $145.  the tickets are $30 - so - $54/person for everything.

we will leave at 4 on Friday if that is ok with everyone.

I hate it when I'm right, Kitna will be benched before week 2.  Garcia is 
still available, but I will need a starting RB - imight be able to swing 
another RB in the deal like Fred Beasley- Or you can start Ryan Leaf

What do you think?

Hi Boys,

Your father and I have decided to tell you what  your Christmas present is 
early.? We will provide to each of you roundtrip  airfare, lodging, groceries 
at the condo, car and lift tickets for our ski  trip.? We are not certain 
where we will go but have selected the  dates.? We will leave Houston on 
Sat., 12/09 and return Thursday  12/14.? Now, what we need to know as soon as 
possible, i.e., today, so that  we can book the air.? If you will accept our 
Christmas present, accompany  us at this time and whether we should book 
airfare for 4, 5 or 6.? (I need  to know the ages of the girls.)? The airfare 
costs will be $300-$500.?  If I book it for 4 or 5, the tickets need to be 
paid for within 30  days.
?
Merry Christmas.? Let us hear from  you.
?
Love, Mom and Dad

What it the abbreviation for our website?

my parents want to go skiing from 12/09 - 12/14 can you take off time then?  
the package is probably around $700-900/

Remember - all pickup requests must now be sent through Pat Ryder at

alright, no williams

can i interest you in a receiver and say lamar smith for robert smith or ron 
dayne

so basically what you are saying is that had you had the 3rd pick in the 
draft you would have taken r williams

   

No, I think stephen davis will come back to earth this year and I really 
think ricky will have a big year.  

   

just out of curiousity, would you do stephen davis for ricky williams 
straight up?

   

I know everyone will think I'm nuts but I want to hold on to Williams and 
Moss.  

   

Stephen Davis, Terry Glenn and Bill Schroeder for Williams, Moss, and Travis 
Taylor?

did she try your patience?

   

I got my little review today.  It was a positive experience.  She didn't 
really say anything negative at all- and she even commented that she felt bad 
not giving me any constructive criticism- but that she was really surprised 
at how good of a job I did- with only being a rotator and having such limited 
work experience.  She said that after I finish my third rotation in EES she 
would like for me to consider taking a permanent position in her group.  We 
will talk about it more towards the end of this rotation.

So- I am currently NOT irritated.

Thanks again for the golf on Wednesday.  It was a lot of fun.

Remember:

The free add/drop period will end on Wednesday Aug30 at noon.  After that

pick up a player you need to submit a bid by e-mail to Pat by 5:00 PM on 
Wednesday of every week.  The person with the highest bid will receive the 
player ($0 bids are acceptable).  

Each team will start with $100 auction dollars.  Each week the team with the 
lowest total points year to date will get $12 added back to their total, the 
team with the highest YTD pt total will get $1 added back and teams in the 
middle will get their according dollar amount based on their rank in YTD pts.

ALL TRADES WILL BE ASSESSED A $5.00 flat fee.

Also, let me know how you want to handle dues (a total of $110).  Should I 
collect them up front ?

Mother,

I had offered to come and be there during your surgery.  Both you and Dad 
replied that it was not necessary because the surgery was not that serious 
and there was no timeframe on its completion.  You know that I love you and 
Dad very much, and that I do not have a favorite parent (if that was your 
implication with your last comment).

If you are unhappy with Jason's actions that is fine, but you have to 
remember that my brother and I are different people.  You cannot neccessarily 
associate his actions with mine.  Please take that into consideration.

I love you very much,

Eric

Dear Jason,
?
I know it has been two months since my  surgery.? I don't know why the 
feelings have finally surfaced.? I did  not even say anything to your father 
until today.? 
?
First of all, I expected to see 3 smiling faces  when I awoke in the recovery 
room.? I only saw one.? I was  devastated.? I will get over it but it has to 
run its course.? Nothing  would have prevented me from being by either one of 
your sides under similar  circumstances.? I know you have lives, work, etc., 
but you, especially,  always find time for friends in need, i.e, Donnita's 
mother and Donnita's  15-minute oral surgery.? Give me a break.?? But, the 
most heart  wrenching thing is, until today, you never gave it a second 
thought. How would  you have felt if I had not been there for you? The final 
blow, though, was the  realization that you would take time to be with 
somebody else's mother and take  an entire day off for Donnita's oral 
surgery.? Actions speak louder than  words.
?
I'll get over this.? In fact, I've gotten it  off my chest and this is the 
end of it.? But, I cannot help but wonder, and  I want you both to answer 
this truthfully, if it had been your father, would you  have been there?? 
Just curious.? You reap what you sow.? I guess  I was not very good at the 
sowing part.
?
Love, Mom

you tell me that you are cheating on me . . . .  interesting

   

FYI-

I am planning on having lunch with a guy that I went to grad school with 
today- he is bringing me all the outlines that he used to study for the CPA.  
Anyway- just didn't want to not tell you- because then it would seem like I 
was trying to hide it.  

I sent that file to you in error. Please disregard.

Thanks,

Eric

check this out on my offer of schroeder and harris for engram
LQCOLOMBO@aol.com on 08/24/2000 04:46:28 PM
my predicament at running back will last me one week, maybe two.  I think 
that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the 
playoffs anyway.  I don't value people by what round they are picked in.  
Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in 
my top 50.  Raymont Harris has been out of football for a while, and is on a 
team that won't run the ball much.  This move would maybe help my team the 
first week, but it wouldn't help me in the long run.  So the answer is no

I think you will be looking up in the standings at me with the team you have 
versus my team so I am fine not doing a deal.  I wonder why everybody wants 
to do a trade with me?  Could it be my team is better than you keep saying.  
I think you are simply trying to get over on me like Harry did Lenhart.
PL

ok, you want something fair, and you want dillon and davis in a package?

how about dillon and davis, for your whole team b/c that is the only trade 
that i think is fair for my team 

let me know what you think

Phillip M Love
08/24/2000 10:09 AM
I do not think your trade offer was fair.  I get a downgrade at running back, 
a downgrade at receiver and an extra back who has not had a carry in the NFL 
since 1998.  Thanks for being fair.  Count me out.
PL

didnt i just make you an offer for connell?  

you are not going to get both dillon and davis

so if you have to have both of them tell me so i can back out now 

but the trade i offered you is fair

Phillip M Love
08/24/2000 09:58 AM
Once again, not interested.  I am willing to do a deal for Dillon and Davis.  
If you can put together a package, I am listening.  I do not like any of your 
other runningbacks and I am willing to part with McCaffrey and Faulk and any 
other receiver I have except Connell.  Or if you like Connell better, take 
McCauffrey out.
PL

alright i would do davis,schroeder, and harris, for faulk and connell

Phillip M Love
08/24/2000 09:42 AM
Thanks anyway.
PL

jj johnson has shown nothing in preseason where as lamar has been excellent , 
they were already talking about lamar being the starte before johnson got 
suspended.

if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you 
have a shaky second rb and no backups that start let alone play.

so let me know

Phillip M Love
08/24/2000 09:23 AM
Yeah, Lamar is solid for 4 weeks until JJ Johnson comes back.  Not interested.
PL

faulk and mccaffrey for lamar smith, davis and chrebet or schroeder

you desperately need depth at rb - lamar smith is solid

Phillip M Love

Whatever, do you think I have any control over Ramiro?

If you do, you are wrong.  He really does not want to trade maybe that is
his way of telling you.

Jason Bass
TSE
Compaq Computer Corporation

engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best
i might add) for a backup WR.

the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will
have a pretty good year.

so don't give me any of that

Ramiro believes Engram is going to have a very good year.  He needs a
Running Back.  I don't think he is being ridiculous.  Engram may be ranked
30th now, but you obviously believe he is a little better than that or you
wouldn't want him so bad.

your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th
best rb
for the 30th receiver?

At the very least, Corey Dillon

i will give you schroeder and raymont harris.

that is a fair offer considering your predicament at rb.

by the way engram was drafted in the eight round, so was harris, and 
schroeder was drafted in the 10th

that is an 8 and a 10 for 8

check this out

another example of how ridiculous people are

engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best i 
might add) for a backup WR.  

the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have 
a pretty good year.

by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd.

so don't give me any of that

Hear anything on Engram?

What is your offer on marcus robinson?

Muhsin Muhammed and Elvis Grbac for Jeff Garcia, Raymont Harris, and Wayne 
Chrebet?

Gives you starting QB and depth at RB (all 4 of your RBs will likely not play 
week 1 and maybe 2).

Let me know

What do you want for Fred Taylor -  do you see he is out for the first 2 
weeks?

Please take time to answer a new poll on the website!

Alright,  I think this is a good deal for you! You get Depth at Receiver and 
Depth at Running Back.

Dillon, Chrebet, Schroeder, and Raymont Harris or Lamar Smith 

FOR 

Williams, Hayes, and Robert Smith

What do you think?

   

I'll think about one.

   

any counter?

   

No ... I am going to ride the back of a Longhorn to the Superbowl.  I don't 
need no stinkin receivers.

The 17 limit I thought started for the first game.  That way we have a chance 
to trade them.  Please advise.
PL

Your running backs suck.  I will give you Raymont Harris and Wayne Chrebet 
for Freeman.

I was thinking that there would be a moratorium on the bidding process for 
free agents until the start of the season.  If you disagree, let me know.

The moratorium will last until noon on Wednesday, August 30th.  You can have 
no more than 17 players on your roster at any time.

since my team sucks so bad, i want to bet you $1000 that i have a better 
record than you this year

Not really, since I had the chance to draft Stephen Davis and passed... While 
I also asked to trade down 2 slots to get Stephen Davis, I am now very 
pleased with the Kult, negotiations with the draftees seems to be going well 
and we should have most with the exception of Bledsoe and Terrell in camp by 
weeks end...

   

so you are basically saying that you wouldn't take stephen davis for gonzo

No sir...

   

i repeat, uou have no offer?

He was my number 2 pick, and I don't want to hear about me drafting him too 
early, else we would not be having this correspondence...

   

so, there is nothing on my team that you are willing to give up gonzo for, i 
find that hard to believe

I took a peek at your squad and no go... Thrill kill will rule this bitch...

   

i will give you walls and terrence wilkins

Your top wide receiver and tight end, and I might throw in my fourth 
receiver...

   

What do you want for tony gonzalez?

i thought we decided that was during the season - up until the season starts 
it is free.

Bryan Hull
08/21/2000 10:13 AM

LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ
Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
the nation's top colleges.
Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas "won" third place.
Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
university.
The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
Brigham Young University was dubbed the top "Stone Cold  Sober" school in the
review.

The top 20 "Party Schools," according to the Princeton Review:
1.  Louisiana State University
2. University of Alabama
3. University of  Texas
4. Florida State University
5. University of Colorado
6.  University of Tennessee
7. University of California at Santa Cruz
8.  Tulane University
9. University of Wisconsin
10. Ohio University,  Athens
11. University of New Hampshire
12. University of Michigan
13.  University of Vermont
14. Ohio State University
15. New York  University
16. Lehigh University
17. Southern Methodist University
18.  University of Florida
19. University of California at Santa Barbara
20.  Union College
The top 20 "Stone Cold Sober Schools," according to the Princeton  Review:
1. Brigham Young University
2. Wheaton College
3. California  Institute of Technology
4. U.S. Naval Academy
5. U.S. Coast Guard  Academy
6. Samford University
7. Cooper Union
8. Wellesley  College
9. Mount Holyoke College
10. Calvin College
11. Haverford  College
12. Golden Gate University
13. U.S. Air Force Academy

15. Grove City College
16. Wells College
17.  Simmons College

By popular vote, we will not redraw.  Our draft will take place, this Sunday 
at 11:45 am at BW-3 in Rice Village.

This is the last one and probably the best - near smu (connected by rail to 
downtown and near greenville - another bar area).  Might be a little more 
expensive but probably worth it.

retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid
the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a
servant, he could take a second wife.
   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is
affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the
directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for
mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include
expanded roles and rights for women.
   "I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with
money women paid in taxes," said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group
promoting women in politics.
   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could
beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it
counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.

   

17 players on the roster

   

	
	                           
	

Are we going to increase the total number of players on the roster since we 
are now starting an extra player?

   

Starting Lineups for the league will include

1 QB
2 RB
3 WR
1 TE
1 K
1 Def

for hector, lenny and brian

1 Quarterback (he throws the ball)
2 Running Backs (they run the ball)
3 Wide Receivers (they catch ball)
1 Tight End (they catch and block)
1 Kicker
1 Defensive team

what about smu area?

Well, the closest one I know is the Crescent Court and that is REAL nice and
REAL expensive.  There are La Quintas and other shitty places scattered all
around there.  Of course in Downtown Dallas you could probably find quite a
few decent places to stay and that is real close to the cotton bowl.  Here
are some other possibilities:

Saturday would be good for me if you can squeeze it in.  I am going to see
Dad tonight.  I will be there at about 7.

Where are you going to be, that puts you on that side of town?

I can do the tv but I am busy all weekend so, if I can do it next week let
me know.  I might be able to squeeze it in on Saturday b/c I will be out
that way.

On another note, do you know of any hotels in the cotton bowl area in
Dallas?

my bro says this place is nice but don't know how expensive

Matt told me he is going to draft an lsu player with the first pick - Eddie 
Kennison

i am going to take stephen davis.  

alright, no more memos about bw3 sucking w/o suggesting an alternative. 
matt, you won't be there, so your input is worthless
bryan, two rows isn't conducive to big groups, so pick some place else.

   

	
	                           
	

BW sucks-lets go somewhere else.

Phillip M Love
08/07/2000 03:07 PM
From what I hear, you can't get rid of the first pick either.  I guess you 
will be taking Terrell Davis or Brian Griese...How about the Denver Defense 
as a number 1 pick?

by popular vote, the draft will take place at noon on 8/20 at BW-3 in rice 
village.

We are going to have the draft on 8/20.  However, we still need to decide 
where and at what time.  I would prefer to have the draft around noon.  We 
can have the draft at a bar (BW-3) or at the enron building (access to the 
internet).  Please let me know ASAP.

Two boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is
attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board
off of a nearby fence, wedges it down
the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving
his friend's life.

A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over
to interview the boy.  "YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL"
he starts writing in his notebook.

"But I'm not a Razorback fan," the little hero replies.
"Sorry," says the reporter, "since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed
you were."

The reporter begins writing again, "BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND
FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK."

The boy replies, "I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either."

"Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an
Arkansas State fan.  You must be a University  of Central Arkansas fan."

The reporter starts writing again "YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG."

The boy said, "I'm not a UCA fan either."

"Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you
root for?" the reporter asked.

"Why, I'm an LSU fan!" the child replies.

The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook: "LITTLE ILLITERATE COONASS
KILLS BELOVED FAMILY PET."

I will be happy to help.  

Mike, please give me a call at 3-0977 and we can set up a time that is good 
for you to observe.

Eric

   

Michael Taylor is a summer intern from LSU, finance major, who has been 
working in Logistics for the Central Desk.  He will be at ENA for the next 
couple of weeks (through 8/11, I believe).  He has not had an opportunity to 
really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective.  I 
had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday, and we brainstormed on 
some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA.  
THis where I need your help!

Eric - As I always do, I sang your praises to Mike, and I thought you would 
be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the 
analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk.  Additionally, since you were in 
Risk also, I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the 
Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role.  If you can 
swing it, I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day, and 
you could explain to him your job, your thoughts behind your actions, the 
data you watch, etc.  Obviously, the intent is educational, not 
interference.  So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best 
approach and timing.

Dave - As I mentioned to you yesterday, I sang your praises also to Mike, and 
I'm glad the two of you were able to meet.  As we discussed, Mike would like 
to have some exposure to the Risk role, so it would be nice if he could sit 
with the group when the books and position are being calced.  I will leave it 
to the two of you to coordinate the day.

Mike's current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4:00am to 
prepare the morning report.  As I understand it, his responsibilities are 
critical up until trading.  So late morning and early afternoon might be the 
best time, but you all can work through it.  When he sits with Risk, he'll 
probably go home and them return when you all start calcing.

George - Obviously Mike's first responsibilities are to Central Logistics, 
and these other opportunities are really on his own time.  We just thought it 
would be good for him to have a Risk/Trading perspective when he is trying to 
evaluate job opportunities.  I appreciate your support in this, but please 
let me know if you have any concerns.

When Mike leaves Enron, he will be going to Seattle to participate in 
MicroSoft's co-op program for the reaminder of 2000.  Obviously, he will have 
a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day, we want to ensure 
he has a great perspective on the opportunities that Enron can offer.  I 
appreciate your time to help Mike.

Warm fuzzies from Andy Rooney

I've learned....
    that the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.
'   that when you're in love, it shows.
    that just one person saying to me, "You've made my day!" makes my day.
    that having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful
feelings in     the world.

I've learned....
    that being kind is more important than being right.
    that you should never say no to a gift from a child.
    that I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help
him in  some other way.

I've learned....
    that no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a
friend  to act goofy with.
    that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to
understand.
    that simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I
was     a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....
    that life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end,
the faster it   goes.
    that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.
    that money doesn't buy class.
    that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.

I've learned....
    that under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated
and     loved.
    that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think  I can?
    that to ignore the facts does not change the facts.
    that when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that
person  continue to hurt you.

I've learned....
    that love, not time, heals all wounds.
    that the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself
with    people smarter than I am.
    that everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.
    that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling
their   breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....
    that no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.
    that life is tough, but I'm tougher.
    that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.
    that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.

I've learned....
    that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he
may     have to eat them.
    that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.
    that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.

I've learned....
    that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his
little fist, that   you're hooked for life.
    that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness
and     growth occurs while you're climbing it.
    that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is
requested and   when it is a life-threatening situation.
    that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.

and schedule a meeting with you to discuss it.  If they do not, it is up to 
you to make the first move and ask to schedule the meeting.

Again, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what 
you do.  I look forward learning even more.

Best Regards.

Can you approve the bom+1 product for HSC-Hehub?

Thanks,

Eric

How about the 24th and 31st pick for the 13th?

I am trying to activate this HSC-Hehub product but keep getting an error that 
says "product is not tradeable".  Is it ready to go yet?  If not, when?

Thanks,

Eric

Big 12: Applewhite eager to reclaim his job
By Mark Wangrin
Express-News Staff Writer

AUSTIN =01* It runs up and down the inside of Major Applewhite's left knee,=
 a=20
four-inch shiny pink speed bump of a scar.=20

If it could talk, it would tell of how the anterior cruciate ligament buckl=
ed=20
as its owner planted while trying to avoid a relentless Arkansas pass rush =
at=20
the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

It would tell of the reconstructive surgery by team orthopedist Dr. Carey=
=20
Windler, how the joint was whipped back into shape with hours of work and=
=20
carefully tended with ice bags and heat and extra stretching and anything=
=20
else Applewhite had read, heard or seen that would help keep his return on=
=20
pace.

If the joint could talk, it would tell people how everything's fine inside,=
=20
how Applewhite could drop back and plant, set up or scramble, in a real liv=
e=20
game today if one was scheduled.=20

If it could talk ... well, Applewhite might well be the happiest guy on the=
=20
planet.

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20
representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h=
e=20
wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20
matter how well-meaning the fans might be.

"I don't want to be rude," he said last week. "I just wish they'd stop=20
asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ..."

Got the picture.

OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=
le.

Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=
ck=20
Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20
Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=
ek

This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=
t=20
from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=
=20
Hardin.

Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.

Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=
=20
when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=
=20
During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20
sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=
=20
football games are played under water.

One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=
th=20
rubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=
=20
supporting muscles and improving his balance.

"If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20
because he wanted to be challenged," Hardin said. "It was a challenge to co=
me=20
up with things to challenge him."

"The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=
=20
up," Applewhite said. "I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=
r=20
six minutes instead of five."

After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=
=20
more on conventional wisdom than necessity.

"I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it," he said. "I don't=
=20
have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason."

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=
=20
which being a renewed appreciation for the game.

"So what if I'm tired?" he said. "I can rest when I die."

Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=
s=20
was a boon for his arm.

"I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=
=20
it felt like my arm was run ragged," he said.

Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20
takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=
=20
will take a little longer.

Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?

"I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris," Hardin said of his=20
occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=
=20
ploy. "But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever."

"It's remarkable the way he's come back," said sophomore cornerback Roderic=
k=20
Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=
=20
speediest receivers in workouts. "In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight."

Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=
=20
Babers said, "I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=
nd=20
Simms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=
ut=20
at the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=
=20
all."

"He's the same old Major," cornerback Quentin Jammer said.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=
=20
duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=
=20
month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=
t=20
competing against Simms, just against himself.

"The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20
have," Applewhite said. "At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=
er=20
on the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=
ve=20
done the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=
l."

Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=
dy=20
strength.

"I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=
=20
blow me over," he said. "I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =
be=20
like Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =
he=20
has to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).

"It's going to come, and it'll get worse," Simms said of the building=20
scrutiny. "To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20
sport. There's nothing you can do about it."

So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=
=20
He's working on his topic for a writing course, "History of American=20
Baseball." The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.

In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=
=20
same. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.

They'll live it.

you realize that who plove takes is irrelevant b/c your are going to take the 
best player available at either slot.  It is what you think you can make up 
with the additional picks.

besides, both of us are at equal risk to who plove picks

I offered you my 1 and 3 for your 1 and 4.  I can throw in my 5 for your 6.

Let me know.

I would like to trade for your 2nd pick in the draft.  I can offer you a 2nd 
round pick and a 9th round pick.  What do you think?

Eric

I will give you my 3rd and 9th round picks for your 2nd.

Let me know.

You're right. We cheated by trying to screw everyone who isn't fortunate 
enough to work at Enron.  

Give it a rest.  The order was determined by an impartial 3rd party.

Here is the analysis that I completed.  Let me know if you have questions.

Eric

   

Have you ever summarized the conversation you had with Jim Schweiger last 
week re: cost to blow-up Entex deal?  I believe Tom is back today, and I 
would anticipate his request for our analysis.  Please let me know - I am in 
meetings all day back-to-back.  Please call on my cell phone - 713-471-2995.  
Thanks.

Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had 
some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off.
Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn 
football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we 
will be playing for the National Championship next year.  

How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?

Later-

Eric

Just in case you were interested.  Here is some of the correspondence that is 
going on.

Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.  Do you want to continue this 
and thus start 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def?

Also,  I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior 
to the draft.  I would prefer to do this b/c it gives the opportunity to plan 
and trade your picks.

Let me know.

 WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION

Where We're Headed
    By Robert A. Waters
****************************************************************

 You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your
 bedroom door.

 Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled
 whispers. At least two people have broken into your house
 and are moving your way.

 With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed
 and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the
 chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.

 In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a
 weapon--it looks like a crowbar.

 When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the
 shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
 One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to
 the front door and lurches outside.

 As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're
 in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years
 before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently
 regulated as to make them useless.
 Yours was never registered.

 Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
 They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal
 Possession of a Firearm.

 When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:
 authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.
 "What kind of sentence will I get?" you ask.
 "Only ten-to-twelve years," he replies, as if that's nothing.
 "Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven."

 The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local
 newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric
 vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir
 boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say
 about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities
 acknowledge that both "victims" have been arrested numerous
 times. But the next day's headline says it all:
 "Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die." The thieves have
 been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type
 pranksters.

 As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media
 picks it up, then the international media.

 The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney
 says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.

 The media publishes reports that your home has been
 burglarized several times in the past and that you've been
 critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the
 suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you
 would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to
 allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.

 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been
 reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When
 you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works
 against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,
 vengeful man.

 It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.

 The judge sentences you to life in prison.

__________________________________________

 This case really happened.

***********************************
 On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,
 killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was
 convicted and is now serving a life term.

 How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the
 once-great British Empire?

 It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly
 reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and
 established that handgun sales were to be made only to those
 who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing
 to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
 Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of
 any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of
 all shotguns.

 Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after
 the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a
 mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down
 the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,
 17 people were dead.

 The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of "gun
 control", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all
 privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan
 used a rifle.)

 Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used
 a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at
 a public school.

 For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as
 mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real
 kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,
 week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and
 demanded a total ban on all handguns.
 The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the
 few sidearms still owned by private citizens.

 During the years in which the British government incrementally
 took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right
 to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities
 refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,
 claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to
 own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were
 charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the
 Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, "We
 cannot have people take the law into their own hands."

 All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and
 several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young
 thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a
 collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or
 stolen by burglars.

 When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns
 were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.
 Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few
 who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year
 prison sentences if they didn't comply.

 Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns
 from private citizens.

 How did the authorities know who had handguns?

 The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

 Sound familiar?

 WAKE UP AMERICA, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION.

Michael,

Wednesday afternoon after 3:00 would be good for me.  Let me know if this 
works for you.

Eric

Eric,

Let me introduce myself.  I am currently Director of Tax for the Enron India 
business unit and have been with Enron in various Tax functions for 
approximately 5 years.  I have been asked to sit on the Enron Corp. 
Performance Review Committee as PRC Representative for a group of  18 
Analysts, including you.  Your 6/2000 performance results will be presented 
to the PRC on 19-July PRC, along with all other Analysts.  

I want to make certain we both take full advantage of the PRC process.  To 
that end, I need you to bring me up-to-speed on your pre-Enron background and 
what you have accomplished while at Enron, in particular during the 6/2000 
review period, and what you intend to accomplish this year (your "goals").  
With this information, I can be best prepared to speak of your achievments 
during the 19-July PRC presentation.  

Here's what I need -

resume (most recent is fine,  even if out of date)
name of your "PRC Supervisor" ( i.e., the person who has gathered your 6/2000 
Feedback)
location and phone extension
your goals for the 2000 year (if these were not formalized, I would 
appreciate your doing so)
accomplishments this review period (especially toward achievement of your 
stated goals)
outside activities which support the community, especially those where your 
represent "Enron" (e.g., charitable endeavors)
other activities you are involved in which support "Enron" as a whole (e.g., 
college recruiting)

One last thing, please forgive the somewhat impersonal use of email.  I would 
like to meet you in person and hope that we can arrange that early next 
week.  Would you be available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon (11/12-July) for 
30 minutes?  We could use that time to run through your background materials.

Please furnish the name of your "PRC Supervisor" by email ( my list indicates 
it is Tom Martin ) so that  I can contact them for a copy of the business 
unit PRC materials that should have recently been completed for you.

Thanks for your help ... I look forward to meeting you !

By popular vote, we will have a draft instead of an auction and the draft 
will take place on 8/20.

Rules to follow.

Eric

We have had a request to change from a draft to an auction system for 
acquiring players.  Please take a look at www.fanball.com and take the links 
to the auction ( I think it is Auctions A-Z) and let me know which option you 
think is better.

i told you so!

If you are currently an analyst in a commercial rotation, then you are 
eligible for promotion to a third year analyst.  After you have completed 
your third year, then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial 
associate.  These guidelines were effective on 6/1/2000.  The conversation 
that you and I had was prior to these changes.   Effective 6/1/2000, the 
Office of the Chairman has made it very clear that we are to adhere to these 
promotion guidelines going forward.

Celeste Roberts

   

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

The new draft date is 8/20 by overwhelming majority.  Stay tuned for further 
details. 

Hector,

I invitate you touch my big, beautiful, American breasts!

Hi Everyone,

Well, it's official.  I am finally making the final arrangements for my move 
to London!  I leave Friday, July 14th, but before I go I would like to throw 
a going away bash.  It's been awhile since we've all been out together so I 
hope you can make it.  I am sure that I have forgotten people, so please 
forward the email on.

The festivities will commence at my apartment next Friday, July 7th....at my 
apartment.  I'll be providing beer and wine but feel free to bring your 
favorite beverage.  I live a block away from the Galant Knight...if you can't 
make it to the apartment, meet up with us at the Galant Knight on Holcombe.

I live at 7777 Greenbriar #3056.  My gate code is 284.  If you need 
directions, leave me a message on my voice mail and I'll call you 
back...since I will out on vacation for most of next week.

I hope to see you all!

Carrie

Yep, I hit the site every day to check out the weather and snow reports.  I 
am excited because I haven't experienced real winter like conditions for 3 
years. 
Have you been skiing before?

There are some conflicts with the draft date, so we will probably need to 
have it on a different date.  Please tell me if you prefer 9/2 ( the day 
before the season starts) or 8/20.  We could also do it during the week, but 
it will probably takle 3 or 4 hrs.

Let me know suggestions.

what day is good for you?

Why?  Just b/c it wasn't what I was thinking??  You are so argumentative- 
maybe you really should consider law school.  No seriously- if that is really 
what you would rather- it is not a big deal to me.

But- when the new Harrison Ford movie comes out- we are going to see that.  
Opens late July.

Looks nice.  I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing 
my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules 
from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are 
league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, 
too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.  
You all do not stand a chance!

John Cote asked me to forward this information on to any guys that I thought 
might be interested.  Apparently, he thinks I know a lot of noble men here at 
Enron.  All kidding aside, this sounds like a worthwhile thing, if you have 
the time.  If any of you are interested, contact John Cote at ext. 3-3830.

Hope everyone has a great 4th of July!
Thanks,
Christa

here is the correspondence so far

By the way I am going to kick all of you asses this year

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.

-Eric

let me see how many are interested.  i am aiming for 12 and i already have at 
least 10 (hull, you, me, jason, mick, harry, hector, matt, gary lam., ramiro)

   

Bill Kasemerviz says he's interested.

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

what are you talking about?

   

It pertains to the love note that you left me.

   

what does that mean?

   

Jealously is the highest form of flattery.

Let me know if you can pull this info together.

I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in 
Texas.  I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming 
on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.  
The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.  
The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., 
natural gas, coal, etc.)

Do you have this information?

Good morning. Lets do Chinese food tonight, and try  Fung's Kitchen, 7320 
Southwest Freeway. It is on the north side I believe around  the Hillcroft 
exit. Say 6:30. Let me know if that is okay with  you.-Dad

I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what 
hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.

What do you think?

Those look good, thanks.

The plan suggested the city, county and state each issue up to $30 million =

bonds to cover a portion of an arena that could cost $220 million.

The arena would be built to attract the Rockets or another professional=20
basketball team.

Team officials visited with Louisville business and government leaders last=
=20
month. The Rockets have also been in negotiations with Baltimore, New Orlea=
ns=20
and St. Louis, but Louisville was the only city to publicly court the team.

City officials wanted to submit a proposal to the Rockets by Tuesday, but t=
he=20
county indicated it wasn't ready to participate in the plan, the Houston=20
Chronicle reported Tuesday.

"Please do not issue any statements of commitment, or send a memorandum of=

Judge/Executive Rebecca Jackson wrote in a letter that was delivered to=20
Louisville Mayor David Armstrong.

The letter, dated Monday, was also signed by the county's three commissione=

This reimbursement is for the CFA test.  I am in the analyst program, do I

You're done,  Hale is starting on Sat.  LSU doesn't stand a chance!

Dear Eric,

Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by
ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to
finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by
the end of the day today.  That's great news!

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on
CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really
want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and
that's going to take numbers.

Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of
the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide --
especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans
behind us.

So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell
your friends directly to visit
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com

"Hand counting" of ballots is still going on in
several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight
is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep
collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially
certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.

Remember, with every day that passes without a certified
Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election
increase.

For Election Integrity,

you know that all of us (Matt, Chad, and I)are just fucking with you about 
the EES bullshit.  if it bothers you that much then say something about it.  
as far as my comments on your performance here, i was just kidding.  i know 
that brenda thinks the world of you and that you wouldn't have stayed even if 
invited, besides, i learned from the intramonth guru himself.  i was just 
trying to defend myself because you were saying that all i do is follow tom's 
lead.  and, by the way, i did not make a comment about ees until you brought 
up the cfa.  i know that you, matt, and chad think that i had nerves and that 
is why i didn't take the test, but why the hell would i have nerves about a 
test that has no bearing whatsoever on my future.  

so quit the bullshit, and, TEXAS will still beat the shit out of LSU on Sat.

Look man, you started this shit by bringing up the same cheap EES comments 
that you always do when you have nothing better to say.  When I have to put 
up with that lack of respect from you on a daily basis, I consider it below 
the belt.  I would have liked to keep this to the game, but for some reason 
you always add the bit about EES.  Besides, don't throw Brenda choosing 
between you and Heidi in my face.  That doesn't add much credibility.

Between friends,  life and work are not constant competitions to see who's 
smarter or who makes more money.  I was genuinely happy for you when you 
decided to stay on at the desk.  As a matter of fact, I remember giving you 
advice, as a friend, on that very subject.  I hold no resentment or jealousy 
that you got it and I didn't.  I wouldn't have taken it anyway.  I neither 
liked my job in risk or felt that I was exceptional at it.  But, I did it 
well enough to bide time and move on to something that I'm more suited for.  
My move to EES wasn't a banishment, but a choice.  It was a risk that paid 
off very well.  Of course you are better at what you do than I.  But I 
seriously doubt you could be as effective as I am in front of a Customer or 
managing a project.  It's all about what you do well and being happy with 
that.  I'm glad we both are, but attempting to make me or my position less 
important because I don't work on the trading floor is just typical ENA 
arrogant bullshit.

....And you have no history about getting hammered and hooking up with skanks 
(i.e. Indian Princess.)  At least I don't take them on dates (that was 
justified.)  Now let's cut this crap and move on. 

Or I'll send my Dad to beat up your Dad.

Out.

I guess it isn't as tough as EES, you're right.  I would hate to have to come 
to work at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 everyday.  I guess I just had this 
opportunity fall in my lap because I never have added the kind of value that 
you did while in risk or EES.  I guess that is why I got offered a promotion 
to stay and you were sent packing to Enron Siberia.

P.S. Shanna has another skank friend coming in town this weekend, maybe you 
can hook up!

Hack it?  Not too tough to be a "yes" man and claim someone else's profits as 
your own.  Besides, I hope you can handle the pressure of the trading floor a 
bit better than pressure of the CFA.  Food poisoning?  C'mon.  

P.S.  I hear Tom's on vacation soon.  You'd better flatten out.

It may not be rocket science, but not everyone can hack it.  Isn't that why 
you left the wholesale side of the business?  Besides somebody has to take up 
the slack for EES.  Let the me know when you need some earnings to cover your 
loss for the quarter, I'm sure I can spare some out of my book!

Remember, buys are 1/2 cent above Tom's buys and sells are 1/2 cent below.  
Keep up the hard work.  It's definitely rocket science.

Bass, give it up.  You are done.

The Tigers wear the mantle of favorite well. They have won
                    nine straight games in postseason play, including the 
Southeastern
                    Conference tournament. They are relatively healthy. They 
have power
                    hitters, they have patient hitters, and they can field 
better than recent
                    versions of the club. Best of all, they have a lot of 
arms, and they have
                    Bertman around to use them. 

You had to hit below the belt.  We were having a friendly shit talking 
contest, which, by the way, you started, and then you took the gloves off.

What's up with that?

Pool (not the east pool)

Thanks,

Lot's of manual intervention..............................

I am trying to create the WkD for other areas beside HPL/HSX E but keep

so that we can trade them on eol?  

Thanks,

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig "Speedy" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M"tt"l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M"tt"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M"tt"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

I love how I am included on the risk outing e-mail distribution list.  I mean 
why would I need to take a job in your department when I get e-mails about 
all the events anyway?

Yes, we have finally suckered some other Enron group into taking on Bryan 
Hull.  Just teasin', Bryan's last day with the Risk Team will be this Friday, 
June 2nd.  It wouldn't be right if we didn't send him off without his well 
deserved roasting.

This Thursday evening at 5:30 we will gather at Teala's on W. Dallas to bid 
Bryan farewell.

For future reference, Bryan will be joining the EOL group on the 26th floor 
on Monday, June 5th.  His extension will be the same so feel free to continue 
to harass him. 

See ya there! 

If, in haste, we have left anyone off our distribution please forward the 
invite on.

Thanx!

Practice tonight at  Memorial Park,  7pm.     Meet at same place as Monday 
night.

IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.

From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in 
the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's 
prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. 

If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as the tennis courts...

If   you are interested in wagering....   here are some bets that Webb 
Jennings is putting out on the 1 st game.

We are going to be rolling out a new product on EOL starting this bidweek.  
This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend 
delivery).  Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of 
logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Eric
We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

Danielle Samson <DanielleS@JonesGranger.com> on 05/16/2000 09:10:49 AM
Sorry to hear about your neck!  Are you all right?  What happened?

Eric,

We've reviewed your wellhead accrual income data for February, 2000 and 
present our input on the attachment.  Generally, we have a few minor 
questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings 
account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. 
$2.477 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related 
(Western Gas 500752 & 507804 and Pan Energy 500560).  The dollar amount 
involved are quite minor.

I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number 
($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.  As we discussed, would you 
therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 
so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?  Thanks.

George x3-6992

 

Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in 
mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system 
so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system 
accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.

My supervisor is Thomas A. Martin.

Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month 
( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).  This value should not be 
given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.  There is a file 
in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility 
fees.  For further info contact Vance Taylor. (the file is called fac costs)

In addition,  I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me 
regarding accrual value.  He thinks that the Coastal Deal that shows up as a 
huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.  Could you 
check into this and get back to him?

Thanks,

Eric

   

Are the facility fees part of the accrual piece we are holding out for Greg 
Sharp?  If not, how can we find the deals we have held out value to cover 
these fees?

When it becomes a crime to love, you should probably

They say a smile is a gift which is free to the giver

I really just need historical throughput, especially third party, to the 
major market areas.  I am going to analyze this data from a temperature 
correlation perspective to see if we can use weather derivatives to hedge 
throughput exposure.  
Data as far back as can be pulled accurately would be helpful.

Call with questions.

Eric

We have access to a pretty realistic (close to actual) physical throughput 
number going back to about February of 1998.  Anything prior to that would 
take some work to come up with.  If you are looking for a scheduled 
throughput number the best place to get that data from would be POP's/Unify.  
By totalling all of the reciept or delivery contracts and including any 
Bammel activity, you should get a pretty accurate scheduled throughput 
number.  You just have to make sure you don't double dip on gas going through 
processing plants, partnership activity, etc.

Let me know what you and Ed are looking for and we can help pull the data 
together.

Dale Neuner   05/04/2000 01:41 PM

Michael - can you give me an idea of where we are in uploading the Specs for 
this.

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the 
Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we 
passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, 
that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will 
skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of 
the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the 
month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to 
get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent 
to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.

In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We 
will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close 
these Position Values will be. 

Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product 
during bid week? 

Dale

Mark Dilworth
04/28/2000 04:23 AM
Michael, 

I owe you a spec. re. this and here it is:

The volume for products that have delivery frequency of:

Daily
Hourly
Half Hourly

need to be modified by the multiplier week coverage factor. 

This is found on table EOL_WEEKDAY_GROUPINGS, and the link is

EOL_MARKET_PRODUCTS.DELIVERY_WEEKDAY_GROUP_ID = 
EOL_WEEKDAY_GROUPINGS.WEEKDAY_GROUP_ID. 

M

Mark & Michael,
Remember we had discussed this when you were here.
The question is ......................in EOL Reports there is a Position 
Summary Report and in Stack Manager there is the Transaction Summary.
will these calculate properly on the 24x5 product? The start date & end date 
will imply every day but the product excludes weekends.

We have finsihed creating and testing a the new 24x5 Nat Gas Product (a month 
long transaction which only moves gas Mon-Fri). A final question has come up 
- how will these be calculated. Jennifer is under the impression that 
something was being built in the EOL Position Summary Report that would be 
able to calculate these kinds of trades. Is that the case? Has that been done?

Dale

Any news?
we would like to trade that this bid week

Thanks,

Eric

Hey Ner,
Did you get a response from Brian on where to find the Credit Card
comparisons?  

Here are the numbers

   

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

We need these locations set up to trade financial products for now.  We will 
be trading physical at Carthage but firmness is not a problem there.  Agua 
Dulce firmness may be a problem for physical, but as of now we are only going 
to trade it financially.

Dale Neuner   05/01/2000 09:43 AM

Since the Product Type description is "US Gas Basis", it is implied that the 
swap is against last day NYMEX and some othe MONTHYL CONTRACT PRICE, which is 
why we specify GD/D, so the viewer knows its a NYMEX last day vs. Gas Daily 
Average price. Take a look at the Indexes used in the other Basis swaps that 
are out there and you'll see what I mean.
I'm a little concerned about the request for Agua Dulce and Carthage. If 
memory serves me, Elsa tried to push these through earlier and it was 
determined that gas at these delivery points was interruptable. Interruptable 
gas is NOT offered on EOL. PLease check with Elsa on this.

   

Dale,

On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a 
good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something 
like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC. 

In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua 
Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.

Thanks for your help.

Hey Paul,

I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag 
Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney 
starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game 
(2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,

Hope all is well.  Is this in reference to the Enron/Andersen Consulting 
football game?  When is it?  Do you need me to play?  Give me a call and we 
can discuss (3-9557).  

Thanks,

I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hook 'Em!

Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in 
mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system 
so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system 
accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.

Thanks to all of you for your generosity and support of the MS-150.  This 
year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating 
in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.  Enron once again had the largest team, 
breaking the national record with over 400 riders.  This year, the MS Society 
expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.  With your 
support, Enron will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in 
pledges to date.  Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in 
Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible 
disease.  

The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.  The race started 
off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.  Team Enron once 
again had the privilege of starting first in the race.  Things were going 
pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear 
wheel.  Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was 
completely bent.  I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the 
first rest stop where they could do the repairs.  Unfortunately, it took me 
over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.  So much for the early start!

The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time 
I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.  After lunch in 
Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all 
the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.  In LaGrange, Enron 
treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much 
appreciated after 100 miles of riding.  The atmosphere in the camp is a lot 
of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with 
stories about the day's ride.  

The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's 
famous pancake breakfast.  We needed the carbohydrates because the second day 
features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.  My legs were 
a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed 
up and ready to go.  I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.  
For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.  It's 
actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, 
and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.  Once we were out of the 
park, lunch was only a few miles away.  I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches 
and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.  Only 40 
miles left!  

After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.  
At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the 
toughest part.  When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck 
it up and keep going.  They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can 
feel the anticipation building.  The last mile of the race is packed with 
people on each side cheering you on.  It's quite a rush when you get to the 
end.  Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston 
and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.  What a ride!

Thanks again for your support.  Just to let you know, I'll be coming around 
next week to collect your pledge.  Your contribution is, of course, fully tax 
deductible.  Enron is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking 
care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).  

Hope to see you in the race next year!

Brian

we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, 
but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are

you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar.

suggestion... make a playbook that just shows individual routes.. that way 
Luis can just customize  in the huddle....

Ex.   outs, curls, out-and-up, post..  etc...     

also,,    You give routes to the linemen and they should block  and then roll 
out into the open flats once the defense goes past.... 

AND... most importantly.. how did you  draw those plays  excel....

that is the website i like!!

Thanks for the information.  We are using it to try to get a sense of the 
increase in demand created by this new generation.  I have cross referenced 
some of your info with some info from the power desk.  this info is 
attached.  In addition, it would be helpful to get a copy of the maps you 
mentioned below.  Please let me know when you can send the maps.

Thanks,

Here is the information that I have compiled about new IPPs in Texas.  What 
exactly are you using this for? I also have ArcView maps of the majority of 
all the plant locations with surrounding pipelines. If you have any

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

What I am really looking for is a way to save monthly production data by 
county for the entire state for all of the data.  Unfortunately, saving the 
data like you mentioned wouldn't save me that much time. 

Thanks for your help.

Eric Bass

When you call up the production save the file as a txt file then open it in 
excel as a delimited file.
If you need any help please feel free to give me a call or email me your 
phone number and I will be happy to walk through the steps with you.

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =

=       $13,000

Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)

There is not enough data on it to make an educated decision.  It looks like 
they have the backing of an I-bank to place some more stock so that is 
somewhat encouraging.  You are going to have to make your own call on this 
one.  If you like the idea and you think they can execute, then go for it.

Hey Eric will you check out this stock and let me know what you think.. Good

Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.

Call with questions.

what's up with the migraines? that is two weekends in a row!  the concert was 
good - we left a little bit before the goo goo dolls finished - i got to hear 
black ballon and name - so i was happy.   i felt sick this weekend too - so 
mine was pretty uneventful - i just lounged most of the weekend.  I did get 
to go to a game at my new field (Enron).  It is a great place to see a 
ballgame.  You really can appreciate the difference between Enron Field and 
the Astrodome.

I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

I wanted to take a minute to apologize to you guys for the scene at last 
night's game.  I did not do a captain's job of controlling the situation, and 
I am sorry.  That being said, I am writing to determine if we will have a 
team in the next session.  We had previously committed to play, but with 
recent developments, I am not sure if everyone is still interested.  Please 
let me know if you will be interested in playing in the next session because 
I have already told the sportsplex that we will be playing.  If we decide not 
to play, I need to let them know ASAP and try and get the money back(forfeit 
deposit).  It is critical that I get a 100% response to this email to gauge 
whether or not we have enough people.  Due to the increased number of the 
people on the team working in risk, we will need as many bodies as possible 
due to the early games this session(they start this time at 6:30).  The 
season begins next wednesday.

Thanks again for a fun and memorable season and I hope we do it again(at 
least the fun part).  Have a good weekend.

FYI
	
	

Just so everyone is on the same page:

Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new "tokenized 
period" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is 
to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  
This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments.

It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with 
Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

Dale,

Ed Gottlob would like to set up a meeting with all of the necessary 
counterparties in order to discuss this product.  Can you find out when a 
good time would be?

Thanks,

Eric

Dale Neuner   03/28/2000 10:56 AM

Eric -

Logistics is telling us that this product is not presently traded OTC. The 
Sitara group is telling us that we don't presently have the ability to 
support this product, which is probaby a result of the fact that is is 
unprecedented. 
To my knowledge EOL doesn't have the ability to eliminate specific dates 
between the Start Date and End Date.

David, essentially this product would be a calendar month long US Phys Gas 
contract where we DO NOT move gas on the weekends. 

Can we chat about this please.

Dale

   

Dale,

Have you heard anything more on the 5 X 24s?  We would like to get this 
product out ASAP.

You will get reimbursed once you have taken the exam.  After you have done 
that you may use the education assistance form and turn it in to Randy Martin 
for reimbursement.  This can only be done after the exam has been taken.

Thanks!

Dolores,

I have signed up for the CFA exam in June.  Who do I need to talk to to get a 
reimbursement?

Thanks,

aren't we presumptious.  of course i want to see you tonight.  but i have to 
work out before coming over!  what are you making me for dinner?

and do you want me to bring over a movie?

and, by the way, you have my permission to go to your little crawfish boil on 
sat.

Shanna Husser@ENRON
03/21/2000 01:00 PM
Hey!  Did we ever come up with our plans for the week/weekend?  I know that 
you said you were busy Wednesday and Thursday night- so I figured you and I 
would do something Friday night.  Michelle (one of the girls that I work 
with) asked if I wanted to go with her to a crawfish boil Saturday late 
afternoon- but I got the idea that it wasn't a bring a date type thing.  I 
haven't eaten crawfish in an age- so sounded like fun- I know that we don't 
usually so stuff during the day on the weekends- but I wanted to make sure 
that you didn't have anything planned for us to do that afternoon before I 
told her one way or the other.  But- even if I went to the boil- I would be 
back in time to go out later that night.  

Just let me know what you think.  Oh- and I guess since you can't see me 
Wednesday or Thursday- that probably means that you want to see me tonight. 
:-)

Shanna

Have you heard anything on the sitara issues?

Thanks,

Eric

Can you help me out here?  I don't have the details in the attached E-mail.  
So I need to understand what the product is so that we can determine the 
"back office" issues.  Apparently, time frame is short.  So I appreciate the 
info ASAP.  Thanks.
Edward D Gottlob

Brenda, can you get someone to work through the issues the back office may 
have.  I would like to get this product up and running before the end of 
April.  EDG

FYI.  There might be some back office issues with this.  
Dale Neuner on 03/16/2000 04:25:45 PM
My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

Dan,

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring 
outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?

Thanks,

I am finally coming home this weekend (from India).  Doesn't flag football 
start soon??  If so, shouldn't we get a practice together at some point next 
week??

Tim,

I can only imagine your excitement w/ LSU and the fact that for one day and 
until your team is eliminated, you are the superior school.  I havent seen 
one minute of one game so your picture was what I had in my mind from what my 
friends told me.  I also know that my tournament brackets are fucked up and 
absurdly low.

Luis

i will go if you want me to - does that sound familiar?

Shanna Husser@ENRON
03/20/2000 02:33 PM
OK- Would I have asked you if I didn't want you to go??  Just like a woman.

 In all honesty- if you don't want to go- I probably won't go either.  I am 
not a huge professional baseball fan- it is so slow!-  so to go to something 
like that I really need to enjoy the people that I am with.  Don't think that 
the tax department necessarily falls into that category- but would be 
bareable if you were there. Just a side thought- but my dad would be so mad 
if he knew I had the opportunity to go- but didn't.  Don't know why that just 
popped in my head.  I guess I write e-mails using "stream of consciousness" 
also.

Also- you know- you and Jennifer are a lot alike.  You know how you send me 
ugly e-mails when you are the last person on any group e-mail that I send 
out.  Well- she is even worse- she just called and yelled at me- b/c she was 
not the FIRST person on a group e-mail that I sent.

gone away, so I'm
  not feeling 100% today.  I won't be able to get together

on in  school
  this week.  Keep in touch and let me know what day is good
for you!

I'm sorry, I forgot that you were clairvoyant.  I don't think you can make a 
case that you were smart for betting me without the points.  That's like me 
saying that Enron's stock is trading at 70 why don't I buy it for 80 b/c I am 
confident that it is going to 90.

That's real smart.  No wonder EES loses money!

   

Going below the belt?  If that makes you feel better, because you were wrong 
about your team and conference AGAIN, so be it.  There are still seats 
available on the bandwagon.  The fee is only $50.  How smart you were to bet 
me without giving any points - definitely worth bragging about.

Happy St. Patrick's Day!
I'm moving this weekend to another apartment in the same complex.  We're
overlooking the pool now, so stop by and visit.  I've attached the new

Things here in Houston are going well.  I'm going to Eastern Europe March
29-April 11.  The tentative schedule is Budapest, Prague, Munich, Salzberg,
Vienna, and Marseille.  The weekend after I get back is the MS-150 bike ride

from Houston to Austin, so wish me luck!

Market deals are only captured in accrual value calculations if they are in 
the wellhead portfolio.  I do not recall any sales currently in the wellhead 
portfolio.  However, I do not see a problem with the market deals unless they 
were marked improperly (e.g. accrual adders).

-EB

   

Would you all look at this, and make sure you all agree with the break-out?  
It is my understanding that this expense has NOT been included in Tom's P&L.  
If so, why hasn't it?   

Eric:  How are market deals reflected in the accrual value calculations?

Brenda,

I am going through the market meters right now and am finding the following 
results for February.

TOM $124,002
GREG      $9,285

I started the process by pulling all the meters and associated transport 
rates off the transport capacity tickets.  I pulled them based on the 
delivery rates being greater than the matrix.  I then researched the deals to 
pull the deal tickets.  If the deal occurred before 7/99, then I assigned the 
expense to Tom.  If the deal occurred after 7/99, then I looked at who the 
dealmaker was and based the assignment of the transport expense on who the 
dealmaker was.  In all cases, either Papayoti or Lamphier did the deal.

I also trued up the transport rate to the transport rate on the deal ticket.  
This includes occasions when the transport capacity ticket did not have a 
transport rate but the transport capacity ticket had an increased rate.  In 
other words, I defaulted to the deal ticket so that we could have a paper 
record of the transport rate.

As of now, I still have to pull January volume and attach the rate to the 
March transport.  I wanted to go through the full analysis first and now that 
I have the actual transport rate from the deal ticket, I know which rate to 
attach.

I will pursue these avenues next.  Please let me know what questions you have.

Heidi

PS Details are attached.

Here is my bracket.  I will bring the money down around 10:30.

When is graduation?  And, of course I will show up.  Although, if I recall, 
you didn't show up for mine!
You can send the announcement to 2512 Milam St. #5216, 77006.
I haven't heard of the advertising firm.  What kind of projects do they work 
on?   I am going to Earth Day. Are you?  Are you bringing Rebecca again this 
year? 
We will probably go out to Kenneally's, Griff's or Birraporetti's for St. 
Patty's day.  What about you?

The fam is doing well.  Dad has been travelling for work and the rest of the
fam, just relaxing I guess.  This is spring break for the girls, so they
haven't been doing too much!  So, where do I send my graduation
announcement?  Do you think you will be able to show up?  Or are you too
busy?  I'm sending my resume to an advertising firm in town, today, Daily
Communications, have you ever heard of them?  Are you still thinking about
going to earth day?  What about st. Patricks day, are you doing anything?

  Brian and Hector are going to Europe at the end of the

Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  How are things with you and the 
fam?

Hey Ner,
Just wanted to write you a quick note and say hi.  I hope everything is
going o.k.  I haven't heard from you in a while.  How's the fam?  Any trips
planned for you yet?  Have you found out anymore about the Europe trip?  How
is work going?  And the apartment?  Are you still getting along with Brian?
Hope all is going well.

-Dee 

Phil,

Can you provide me with the most recent Entex Deferral Balance?

Thanks

I don't know about meter 4486, but the other three are good.  In addition, 
meter 5792 is another meter that is serviced in the Lufkin-Diboll area.

   

Eric, I am checking the process now for incorporating all transport revenue 
due Ed for delivery meters in the Texas region.  The following meters have 
transport rates attached to them which are above and beyond the matrix rates 
Ed quotes to Tom.  I believe that we are already capturing all Ed's 
revenue/Tom's expense for this gas at these meters, but want to be sure of 
that.   Would you let me know if these are the meters for which we are 
manually moving around money from Tom to Ed for the residential portion of 
the Lufkin-Diboll volume?

I believe that the industrial portion of this volume is included already as 
part of Ducote's deal, and I believe that the residential portion is volume 
which you determine and then move from Tom to Ed every month.

Is this right?

Heidi

lets make it worthwhile - how about $500?

   

$50 straight up-no points.  And I don't want to hear any crying that you're 
seeded lower.  If you're as good as you think and your conference is that 
much better, you hould have no worries.

asshole

   

And you are giving me crap about losing money...

?

Tim is once again proving how hard work is over there at EES.  Keep holding 
the stock price back. I am, however, impressed that you were still at work at 
3:50 though.

By the way, I am taking bets from all comers.  So, put your money where your 
mouth is!

Hook 'em

   

Just to show all of you I will never (Chad, that was for you) lose my edge in 
LSU investigative reporting, check out prediction on the attachment.  
Bass-there's always next year.

Check out the outlook.  "A couple of  wins" means a sweet 16 berth. Doesn't 
look good for LSU!

OK- that is it- you either best be in a DAMN good mood by the time you get to 
my place-   OR  I don't know- I'm going to be pissed.  I want to enjoy our 
time together- not fight about you being crabby.  You didn't warn me that you 
were so moody- you ARE like a woman.  And try not to be such a big mouth from 
here on out.  You make me feel like I can't tell you what I really think- b/c 
it will get back to Tim (in other words- all the FIJIS)- I hope that you 
aren't naive enough to think that isn't how it works with them.

Hey!  It's going to be a good day- I can already tell.  I just had one of the

it the small things in life that make you happy?  Well- hope you have a 
better day at work then the past couple- I feel confident that you will- that 
way you won't feel it necessary to get totally loaded tonight on MY date.  Oh 
yeah- I am wearing my orange shirt today.  I have already had so many 
compliments on my brightness-I guess they are all used to me being in black.  
But even though I am wearing my orange- I still only have one thing to say 
Have a great day!!  

Shanna

P.S. Can you tell that I am a little hyper this morning?  I am like bouncing

The world is treating me ok.  It's just that I can't stop losing money.  It 
hasn't been a very good start to my trading life.  What is going on in your 
world?  I hope to make it out to the house sometime soon.

Hi son: how is the world treating you? Saw that gas prices were down

For those of you who aren't history buffs, the individual in question would 
be Woodrow Wilson.  Now, if you all are the reasonably intelligent 
individuals I believe you to be you will have already guessed where I'm going 
with this...  Anyway, given the impending heat wave that will soon be 
striking our fair city, it is my recommendation that we take this opportunity 
to enjoy one more pleasant evening on Woody's deck.  Same Bat time, same Bat 
channel (9:30-10:00).

I guess that feeling is similar to the one you get whenever you are around 
me.  You just don't know what to say.

that you would feel that way.

Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.

IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.

From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.

If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.

----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

I have been to see brooks & dunn, jo dee messina, and ahem rod stewart.  i am 
going to steve miller and kenny rogers.  

i am actually too cool to hang out with brian now - just don't tell him i 
said that.   i don't know about earth day yet but i suspect that i will go 
b/c goo goo dolls are playing.

Danielle Samson <DanielleS@JonesGranger.com> on 03/03/2000 04:24:06 AM
Things here are good as well.  I think I have been to about five rodeos as
well, which ones have you gone to?  The fam is doing well, and yours?  I saw
brian last week and then again on Sunday.  I guess you are too cool to hang
out with him, huh?  Congrats on the new position, so will you pay for me to
go to law school now that you are a millionaire?  Are you going to earth day
this year?  What about buzz fest?  Why are you too cool to write me or call
me?
  

Hey,

work is going great.  i am trading now - wooohoooo!.  I am really enjoying 
the new position.  a lot more responsibility.  
i am going to the rodeo tonight and tomorrow , so that should be fun.  that 
will bring the grand total to 5.

how are things going with you and the fam?

Ok- I'm getting pissed off.  I came in today to work on a project- only to 
find out that my tax application is not set up to do what I need to do.  So- 
basically i can't even start on this until someone from out support team can 
come look at it- and you just don't understand- with our support team- that 
could take a day or two.  See that is the problem here- in EVERY person that 
I have worked with at Enron- NO ONE ever thinks ahead.  No one is a planner.  
Like- I am new in this group- why did no one consider the fact that I 
wouldn't have this on my desktop- and that it would take a while to get it- 
especially on a Friday- when half our staff is gone- b/c it is  THEIR Friday 
off!  

I'm leaving at noon- and I'm not coming back- I don't care if the application 
is fixed or not.  The other lady in our group- that today is her Friday off- 
she isn't coming in.  See I am getting tired of the fact- that they treat 
their rotators like interms around here.  That is basically what is pissing 
me off.  You get all the shit work- that no one else wants to do.  You are 
totally left out of the loop- like why wasn't I told b/4 6 o'clock last 
night- that this needed to be done.  No respect and poor planning.  Very 
dangerous combination.  And I'm tired of it .  It is quickly approaching the 
time to find a new profession.  

OK- enough venting for this morning.  Sorry- I am sure I will be in a much 
better mood when I see you tonight

I will get the dues to you sometime this week. The extra guy is welcome to 
play on our team.  Keep me posted on Uni's and schedule.

Thanks,
Eric

you mean you don't want me to sing it anyway?

Lucky for you that Tim and Lisa decided to go to Kenny Rogers.  I guess that 
means that you are off the hook with having to sing "Though the Years"  :-)

OK- you don't think that the roommate is a little bit touchy about the time 
that you and I have been spending together?!?!?  See what I have to deal 
with.  Knowing full and well that when she was dating Chad- I literally went 
6 days without seeing her.
I think I can call him your boyfriend because you are spending every minute
outside of work with him.

What are you talking about?  You sent me some gay e-mail with a hyperlink.  I 
never read those.  

What's up with you?

I have been really busy with my new job but I cna't complain.  I am really 
enjoying work again.

What are you to good to respond to my emails?  Too good to even talk to me?
What the fuck is up with you?

here is what started it

Chad Landry@ECT

Its been a crazy February!  So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only 
one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.  Everyone just relax because 
its going to be a long one.  As Always, Brace Yourself.

Where to begin?  How about those Tigers?  They are on track to be the SEC 
West Basketball Champions.  Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger 
sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like "Spring Break Everyday!"  That's 
great!  I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams 
are on a winning streak.  Geaux Tigers!

Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!  I recently learned that, 
while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart, 
Sarah, got "Tanked" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of 
the Pat O Brian's  Piano Bar in front of a minister saying "I DO" to her 
boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.  On such short notice, they were unable to 
find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated 
all night at Dante's Pizza.  I hear it was one hell of a party.  
Congratulations Sarah!

Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.  I'd like 
to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and 
Kenny K with him.  If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.  
The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:  The last night of the ball 
after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary 
Landrieu and saying,"Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans 
Lady?"  That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future------a 
regular James Carville!  I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy 
Edwin Edwards a question - "Governor who do you like in the President's 
Race?"  He responded, "Have the odds come out already?!?"  No doubt a man of 
true character.

I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.  Brandon, a full 
time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.  He 
decided to put his "Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back, 
Jack, haircut " to work on the Internet.  He's currently modelling his sweet 
hair style as "Mullet of the Week"  at http://www.mulletsgalore.com/ .  He 
gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site 
to help an aspiring doctor.

February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.  I 
still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate, 
Matt.  Although the chances of him finding one before me are pretty good 
considering all he's looking for is, and I quote, "A girl who is pretty and 
who thinks I am smart just because I read the newspaper."   
ICE---ICE---BABY---TOO COLD---TOO COLD!

Everyone have a great weekend!

hey everyone it is you lucky day!  i forgot to put a few things into my 
famous friday state of the union.  first, i have picked up cooking recently.  
i am a regular emeril.  for my roommate matt's b-day i decided to make him an 
ice cream cake.  it looked so delicious.  i used cookie dough ice cream with 
an oreo cookies crust and whip cream.  for flavor i added two sticks of 
butter (the recipe calls for zero).  it looked so good that i ate it all 
before matt got home.  lucky for me matt came home in time to give me the 
hymlec's because i was choking to death on a stick of butter.  i am 
dissapointed though because i spilled ice cream all over my shirt and matt's 
carpet.  if anyone needs the recipe please call.

i did have a date this week with some girl (we will call her X).  we went to 
dinner and had appetizers, main course, desert and wine.  well, i had wine.  
we then went to my favorite bar.  i got a little buzzed so i let her drive my 
car.  X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato 
sack me into the house.  why do they call it "landry loaded"?

i have been working out lately.  my friends still like to call me dough boy.  
i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.  god i am tan!

keep in touch

ckl 

ps-  please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to 
read my state of the union

Don't get testy. I wasn't trying to get you upset.  I thought we were having 
a normal conversation.  It just didn't seem like you were talking as much as 
usual.

Shanna Husser@ENRON
02/25/2000 11:13 AM

how to read you at all.  Half the time when you say something- I have no idea 
what you are really trying to say.

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.

Two requests for the current Central Power & Light contract 96022030 - Sitara 
Deal 92399:

1.  For January 2000 volumes, we need a deficiency charge added in the amount 
of 12,231.85.

2.  For the entire length / term of this deal, the second step of the tiers 
or NNQ should have the rate handle associated with Gas Daily Houston Ship 
Channel HIGH for the day delivered less one cent.   This is per the 
confirmation Contract Price item 2.  The dollar impact for the incorrect use 
of the MID rate for Jan '00 is 6,395.23.  This same change in the rate handle 
should be made retroactively to November '99 and proactively through October 
'00.

Total dollar impact for January '00 = 18,627.08  added revenue.

Attached is the Jan worksheet.  Questions or comments, please let me know.

HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!

Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact, Telluri=

SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine t=
he=20
local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked out t=
he=20
window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop with our=20
waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But when the=
=20
other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with the=20
anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak preview,=
=20
check out the photo of the day at www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.

BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT=

WHAT=01,S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski Reso=

installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that every li=

pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep. Lifts 1, 4=

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred=01,s, a new=

140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most=20
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.=20
Sophia, Allred=01,s will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an=

One other great new thing: It=01,s easier to get to Telluride than ever bef=

You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American=20
Airlines=01*but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your body i=

one of them!

WHAT=01,S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November 22=
,=20
the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning. Like=
=20
the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you can=
=20
ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and Snowboa=

The official social co-ordinator, Lisa,  will be unable to perform her 
obligations this evening as she is leaving on a jet plane.  As a result, I am 
taking it upon myself to conduct a poll regarding tonight's activities or 
lack thereof.  Please voice your opinions to all whether or not tonight 
should involve some sort of group outing.

Got any good stock picks?

I will probably be able to make valentine's day.

Mike, here is the speach by Charlton Heston that I was telling you about.
Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. "My Daddy," he said,
"pretends to be people." There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, "We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure." Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from "ridiculous" and "duped" to a "brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man." I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, "Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!"

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, "The End of Sanity," Martin Gross writes that
"blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it."

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team "The Tribe" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said "Negroes."
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said "black." But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
"Native-American." I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on "American." Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word "niggardly" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: "David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance." What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, "Don't shoot me." If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of "Cop Killer"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..."

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. "SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...."

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
"We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but Time/Warner _s
selling it."

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of "Cop Killer"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..."

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. "SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...."

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
"We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but Time/Warner _s
selling it."

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

whatever, are you saying that my evite skills aren't up to par?
i am planning on going sunday. what time?  i think michael is coming with me.

everything else is good, i got my year-end review and compensation stuff.

how about you and the fam?

Danielle Samson <DanielleS@JonesGranger.com> on 02/02/2000 05:30:33 AM
I was sick on Sunday, so that wasn't very fun.  I saw the last few minutes
of the game, or the whole game for that matter.  I couldn't reply to your
evite because it was sent wrong......... sorry.  So, are you still planning
on making an appearance on Sunday?  Don't worry, I won't know half of the
people either!:-)  how's everything else?
  

i had a really fun weekend.  we went to chuy's and gallant knight on friday, 
a work party and black swan on saturday, and had the super bowl party on 
sunday.  

about 20-25 people showed up to the party, so it was a fairly big success.  
of course, you didn't show up so it wasn't as successful as it could have 
been.

how was yours?

Danielle Samson <DanielleS@JonesGranger.com> on 02/02/2000 04:01:43 AM

thanks for showing up to the party on sunday.  your new name backout 
ballases!

You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

Is Hill available for trade?  Let me know what on my team interests you.

Hi guys,

It's time for me to move.  If anyone is up to it, let's have the last drink 
at State Bar at around 7.30 or 8.  
See you there.

FB

Just a friendly reminder and more detailed directions(attachment)...

Come any time you would like or if you can't make it, you can join us next 
year.
RSVP's are appreciated but not necessary.

This is special advanced notice for people who have kids or like to plan 
things in advance.  I'll resend out the week of the party.
********
You are all cordially invited to attend the following engagement.  Please 
bring friends and forward this to anyone I may have missed accidentally.

When: Saturday, January 29th-NEXT WEEKEND, not this Weekend.. no one will be 
there!

What:  6th annual John, Robert & Mo's Party (just 5th annual for me).  2kegs, 
assorted mixed beverages, and mystery snacks will be on hand.

Where: 6422 Wister Ln, 77008 713-869-6312, map below.

Time: Whenever till Whenever.

Why:  Why not.

Here is a friendly disclaimer from one of our hosts:

You all know what this is about! Let's set aside this evening to hearken back 
to our younger days... when peer pressure was still cool. Experienced 
IDHAFR's can attest, this is no "Company Cocktail Buffet". IDHAFR newbies 
will just have to take our word for it. Last year I said, "we'll see what new 
lows we can achieve"... Little did I know!!!!!  Dolls in the freezer, RIVER 
DANCING... ON THE FURNITURE (picture my head held in shame). I will make no 
such prediction this year. I can't even promise that there will be a Man in 
Black. But I can promise you'll be sorry you missed it!

We hope this notice finds everyone in good health and spirits this new 
millennium (actually that's still a year away but...) So mark your calendar: 
(Out of town guests are surely welcome, sleeping (?) arrangements can always 
be found. Although I must say I didn't like having to share the space under 
the pool table in '96!)

You will probably have to park far away.  Neighbors are pretty friendly. 

I think we are staying in tonight.  I don't know of any big plans.

Eric,

I'll be in Argentina on the day of the Super Bowl.  Thanks for the invite.
What's the plan for tonight?

June-August were incorrect in Sitara.  I have made the necessary 
adjustments.  Stephanie will have to reissue payments.  By my calculations, 
Cabot owes HPL $16,050.
See Below

Month  Volume/d Rate was Rate Should Be   Economics
6/99    5000     $2.09      $2.20      $ (16,500)     This Should be Sharp's 
expense as this was pre-merger.
7/99    5000     $2.14      $2.20      $ (9,300)        This Should be the 
desk's
8/99           5000     $2.47      $2.20      $ 41,850         This Should be 
the desk's
                                         $ 16,050

   

Eric, 

Why would this ticket only affect Sept. and not the other months?

Melissa

   
	
	

I am only showing a price adjustment for 9/99.  No adjustments for June- 
August occurred.

   

Stephanie, 

The deal ticket that Eric mentions below that changed the tiered pricing is 
EW5406.1 (which fixes the price to $2.35 from 6/1/99-9/30/99).

I was wondering if you showed price adjustments to June-August, in addition 
to September (since this ticket affects all months). 

Let me know, and then I'll call Laurie Clarkson with Cabot Oil & Gas and ask 
her to run this past her trader (Kent Beard) and make sure we are all on the 
same page.

Thanks, 
Melissa

Eric, 

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that 
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie 
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for 
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this 
month?

Thank you,
Melissa
	
	

Melissa, 

Someone has changed one of the price tiers on Cabot for 9/99 production.  Due 
to the price change, it is now showing that I need to take a credit of $ 
52,996.72 from Cabot.  Is this correct or not????  I thought we had figured 
the pricing out for 9/99 and Cabot had also agreed.  Please let me know if 
the price change is correct or not, and if I need to take this credit from 
Cabot.  See below the change that was made in Sitara and I am also showing 
what we paid versus what is now showing up in the system.

Original payment ( per your email below )

          0  -  10,000  $2.1000
10,001  -  20,000  $2.1550

30,001  +  $2.7100

Change that has been made in system

          0  -  10,000  $2.1000

did you get the invite to the super bowl party?

count me in

   

I am buying Astros/Yankees (Thurs. 3/30, Fri. 3/31) tickets at 9 AM 
Saturday.  These are the first 2 games at the new stadium and I'm buying the 
best available tickets to both games.  The maximum tickets allowed are 
8/person.  Anybody in?

It looks like facility charges are covered 1/2000 forward by the individual 
deals.  Mick does not think there are any other outstanding issues for 
transport as a methodology has been established and agreed upon for 1/2000 
forward.

   

Thanks.  Yes I would like for you to add the facilities charges.  
Additionally, will you work with Mick Walters to add his issues also?

   

Attached is a listing of unresolved Issues between Tom and Greg Sharp.  I 
have not included the facility charges - do you want me to add those?

Please feel free to add on to my list anything that I have left off.

Eric, 

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that 
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie 
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for 
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this 
month?

Thank you,
Melissa
	
	

Melissa, 

Someone has changed one of the price tiers on Cabot for 9/99 production.  Due 
to the price change, it is now showing that I need to take a credit of $ 
52,996.72 from Cabot.  Is this correct or not????  I thought we had figured 
the pricing out for 9/99 and Cabot had also agreed.  Please let me know if 
the price change is correct or not, and if I need to take this credit from 
Cabot.  See below the change that was made in Sitara and I am also showing 
what we paid versus what is now showing up in the system.

Original payment ( per your email below )

          0  -  10,000  $2.1000
10,001  -  20,000  $2.1550

30,001  +  $2.7100

Change that has been made in system

Try this out.  It is a questionaire that tells you what kind of dog you are. 
I am a basset hound.

We have actually already called Springer to get on his "Surprise, I'm dating 
your brother" episode.  It's a pretty good deal b/c you get an all expense 
paid trip to Chicago for the weekend.  

I am actually a multimillionare now - I'm thinking about buying that new 
car.  Do you want one?
There is not much going on this weekend on my end - I will probably take it 
easy.  And you?  Let me guess - you are going to try and stop by my place 
(that will happen)?

Danielle Samson <DanielleS@JonesGranger.com> on 01/21/2000 06:52:25 AM
Is this the girl that likes you?  I see a possible Springer  episode! :-)  I
just got back from lunch and I'm feeling a little sick still.  I think half
of the office is out sick.  Too bad I don't own any part of the Big E!  I
guess you just made a million dollars than?  Time to sell, buy low, sell
high, huh?  What's going on this weekend?

Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an 
HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the 
deal more economical.

   

Bass, is this accurate?

Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to 
Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).  
After checking into it, we have all found the following things:

1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals.
2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and 
then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll.
3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10.
4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the 
sales invoice.
5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport 
expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume.
6. Eric tells Mick how much expense Tom is including in his P&L for this 
transportation, and Mick includes it in Ed's P&L as revenue from the 
Marketing   Desk.
7. Phillip does manual G/L entries to show an expense to Tom and a revenue to 
Ed for the same amount .
8. This revenue shows up en masse with all of the other revenue from the 
marketing desk in Ed's P&L.

The total revenue for Ed for this portion is about $6,000 per month.  Eric 
says, too, that Ed shows revenue during the winter months for transport for 
Entex of about $200,000 per month from the marketing desk.  This comes from 
money reserved to manage the Entex deal.

Your list of items is correct.  However, the entex related transport shows up 
on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.  This number is 
manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.  Therefore, this revenue 
shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense.

Eric

   

Eric and Mick, does this match your understanding of how the money for 
transport related to the volumes that Entex pulls for Lufkin/Diboll 
residential volumes end up in Ed's P&L?  Also, do we do anything for the 
industrial volume?  I think we ought to let people know that we accomplished 
this (albeit that we did this a long time ago).  Please let me know.

Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to 
Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).  
After checking into it, we have all found the following things:

1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals.
2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and 
then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll.
3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10.
4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the 
sales invoice.
5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport 
expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume.
6. The money lands in Ed's P&L for the residential piece of the transport 
reimbursement.

Right now, at the end of the month, Eric Bass tells Mick how much the 
transport reimbursement is and Mick includes that money in Ed's P&L as 
revenue from a third party.  The actual money is reflected in Co. 12, and we 
just have to make sure that the money is reflected as revenue for Ed in the 
G/L rather than for Tom.

I'm old now, but i can always find solace in the fact that you are older!  I 
don't know yet if I am going to go out tonight, but if I do we'll probably go 
to Woody's on Richmond - it used to be the velvet Elvis

Would you work with Howard on the Economics of this?
Michael W Morris

Howard,
This memo is regarding the 91,297 MMBtu imbalance that was created in April 
of 1999 on 
transport contract #012-41991-02-004. The transport delivery off HPLC was 
shorted to keep
Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport 
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 
1999, but 91,297 MMBtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC 
Index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can 
clear this imbalance. We will
need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the 
purchase from ENA by 91,297 
MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant 
Energy - Entex allocation to 
make sure this happens.

Thanks,
Michael

Coping With Job Stress

  At a seminar called "Stress and Disease"  by Dr. Nickolas Hall, an
expert in psychobiology, gave an example of a coping skill for job
stress which I would like to share with you.

  When you have had one of those "Take This Job and Shove It" days,
try this:

On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the
section where they have thermometers. You will need to purchase
a rectal thermometer made by "Q-tip". BE SURE THAT YOU GET
THIS BRAND! When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes,
and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your
therapy.

Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit, and lie
down on your bed. Open the package containing the thermometer,
remove the thermometer and carefully place it on the bedside table
so that it will not become chipped or broken.

Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and as
you read it, you will notice in small print the statement that says,
"Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested."

Now.... close your eyes and say out loud five times, "I am so glad that
I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company."

The new pub code is in ERMS.  The name is GDP - HH + 2AFTA.

There will be 2 demos of the New SITARA Risk Assignment release this Thursday 
(Jan 13) in room EB 2537 from 11:15-12:15, and 1:00-2:00.

There will be additional demos for the general SITARA population the 
following week; however, since these changes effect you the most,  I highly 
recommend you attempt to make one of the sessions this week.   We planning on 
rolling the new changes out the weekend of Jan 22.   These are some major 
changes that will effect every deal with risk assignment.

Please make every effort to attend.  

If you currently enter deals with risk assignment - hands on training can be 
arranged.  Also, we will be available to assist you as needed after 
implementation.

A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes 
a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp. 
His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference 
assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much 
does the quality of the high end amp matter?

Thanks

Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.

Thanks,

SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not
say, Eat me"
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry,"
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.

The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to
please everyone..."

Eric, Ami just booked two deals (#148251, #148253) on the BDOL pipe and since 
that pipe had never been used before we do not have that location mapped to 
any curves.  As a result those two deals have not bridged to CPR and will 
remain like this until you provide the necessary curve information listed 
below.  If you will need to create new curves and that will take a while, let 
me know if you want me to map this location to some existing curves in the 
meantime, so it will at least bridge to CPR.  Then, when you create your 
curves I can just re-map the location to the new curves.

There is currently only one zone on this pipe.

whatever babe - i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out - like you.  i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these- like when i had chest pains, the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test.  instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal.  now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable - you should do what you want to do. but i guess what i am saying is that YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE !!! so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem....

You don't seem very concerned about me!

that sounds great.  i am always interested in a free meal.  friday night is probably better for us if you guys want to come into town.  if not, then saturday is fine.

Good morning.Your Mother's birthday is this Friday. I thought I would take all to dinner. Are you interested. If so, is Sat. night better than Fri. night? Let me hear from you. Love-Dad 

no . . . you are going to go dancing with me!

If we aren't doing your mom's thing Friday night- then I am going to study Friday night.  Feel free to go if you want- but I really need to get some studying done- the exam is in less than a month.

hey sheila,
thanks for the invite. my mom's b-day is this friday as well.  i still don't know if we are taking her out on friday or saturday.  so we will try to make it.  

we stayed at the marriot at the capital last year in austin.

-eric

Hey Goofs - 

This Friday is Moni's 25th birthday.  We're celebrating with dinner at 8:00
p.m. at Bossa, and then heading to Slainte and The Mercury Room.  We'll also
most likely go to Bar Houston so we can get Moni to dance on the bar.  I
hope you guys can make it.  I haven't seen you two in forever! 

P.S. - Eric, do you remember the name of the hotel that the four of us
stayed at when we went to the Texas game last year?

Thanks,

sorry no tkts. it was a good game though

Not to rub it in, but I was wondering if you had tickets you might be looking to sell?

Quite a game, huh.

Jody

he told me that he wasn't sure if he would be in town.  i guess there is no need to have two. so i won't have one then

looks like we need to have a co-ordinated effort because i think val may be having people over too.  i am indifferent as to where the party is held, but would like a consensus.  you guys should probably talk about it.

right now i guess we have 6 - i have not heard back from boone.  val said he would stop by if they were back in town by then.  i didn't have mitch's e-mail so you may want to forward to him and i will talk to hull.

i guess we could have about 10 people.

what do you think?

What's the plan?

i don't have any tickets sorry.  are you going to make it up there and try to scalp some?

Yeah, I actually read that yesterday.  
 
Have you ever been to Lawton or Ft. Sill, OK.  Knowing that area,  I understand his view of OK.  I did think 
it was funny though his pointing out the "Bingo" sign being the first thing you see when you cross into OK on I-44. 
I'll take that over the adult video sign on the south banks of the Red R. right beside I-35.  And no, I am not
and have never been a patron.
 
You don't have any spare tickets do you?

Just a little something to get you fired up about this weekend!

out

Our game this Wednesday is at 9,  let me know if you're in or out.

hey dad,
 
austin was fun.  michael ballases and i went up for the day and met up with his family b/c it was parent's weekend.  it was good to see them again.  i am anxious to see how we play against OU.  i am starting to have a good feeling about this team. they looked really sharp on saturday - especially the offense.  
 
shanna and i will come out for jason's b-day on wednesday. i don't know what time yet but it should be around 6:30.
 
see ya then

God afternoon, Son:
 
 How was the Austin trip? I suspect you had a good time. You are now out of my alma maters to beat up on. I thought the tee sips looked good. Don't know how much of that was because they were playing a week sister. Hard to tell what kind of team Tech has, but they did not look good Sat. I suspect we will know a lot more about the quality of team TU has by this time next week.
 You guys coming over on Wed. for Jason's birthday? Hope to se you then. Have a good one. Love-Dad

we are heading over to the Front Porch after work today for some drinks if you would like to join.

Eric - it was good to see you again after all this time. Sounds like you are well on your way to making things happen for yourself. Anyway - I am definitely new in this town as far as I am concerned. So - I don't want to burden you with spending any time with my sorry ass - but to the extent that you want to grab your girlfriend and a friend of hers - I would always be willing to venture out. I definitely need to meet some new people. In any event, I'm sure that we will run into each other plenty at the gym, etc. Talk to you soon Eric.

Here is our detail for October.  

Unfortunately we are unable to provide you with blanket counterparty level detail on our transactions due to legal issues.  However, just as last month, if you have specific questions on any location or transaction, we can examine those on a case by case basis.

Thank you.

 

Hello from Inside FERC,

Tomorrow (Friday) is the last business day of September, and it's the final
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's October 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the "comments" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Friday, Sept. 28.

October monthly prices will be published on Monday, Oct. 1.

Hi Eric,
 
Well, I wasn't overreacting after all.  I got a crdit from AmEx as of next billing cycle (Oct. 4).  I just hope it is a permanent credit and not temporary.  I believe they will honor it.  
 
Have a great day.  LU-M

  <http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-renaissance926.story> 

good call guys.  i am not sure but i believe that i signed contract with you guys that double indemnified me from loss - prior to payment 
 
let me know when i can pickup my check for $8000.
 
 

I think if we had to recover our money from Renaissance, it would be difficult. However, the fact we charged it all on Platinum Amex, and the insurance coverage the card provides for goods/services not received and/or defective, we should receive from Amex 100% of the money, just like the letter said with was faxed to you by Amex this a.m. You did good dear. However, looks like Eric lost all his money because he wrote us a check, which is not covered. Too bad. LU-L7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

What do you think?
Renaissance may not be able to repay millions of dollars in passenger deposits. Unlike most U.S.-based cruise lines, it does not sail ships from U.S. ports and so has not posted the customary $15 million bond with the U.S. Maritime Commission to protect cruise passengers.

my family is doing really well.  jason is getting married in february in fairfield.  he seems very happy.  things are a little sketchy at enron right now with the debacle that has occured, but everything should work out for the best. 

don't worry about all of that stuff, you can do what you please with it.

eric

the family is great!  and yours?  i'm doing well, i'm actually back in
houston and really enjoying it!  i was going through some boxes at my
parents during all the moves, and found some things from austin or maybe
even from high school that were yours.  i figured you probably had no need
for any of them, much less even given any of them any thought, but before i
tossed them, just though i would check.... and no, Lucky was not in the
stack of things to get rid of!  how are things in your life?  i'm sure you
could care less about the books and binders and stuff, but i just wanted to
make sure.  i also just wanted to see how you were doing.

take care.

eric

Congratulations on the wedding!  A sister, finally!  I'm sure your family is
really excited!  As for Enron, you are right, things will happen for the
best.  They always do for you, Ner.

I know what it is like to go through changes, I feel as though I have had so
many over the past year.  Luckily, it seems as though they have all been for
the best.

I'm glad you responded, it is always nice to hear about you and your family!
  I'm always interested in hearing what is going on in your life.

I saw your brother's friend, James not too long ago, I'm not sure if he
recognized me at first or not, but he said hello.  Tell you brother
congratulations for me please, and the family "hi."

Dee

Since you never gave me the $20 for the last time we bet on CU/Texas, I figured I would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round.  I think the line is Texas -9.  Let me know.

that sounds good 9 it is.  we will go for beers regardless

Alright,  I'll take the bet.  I'll have to scrounge around to find 40 buck though!  You know you're stealing money from my severance!  I may need that to eat on by the end of the week.  If you say the line is 9, that works for me.  CU is on a role....it's time for Simms to go down!

If you steal my money, you'll have to buy me a beer.

Hey Brett,
What's been happening?  I hope you didn't buy any enron!  It is looking good for the Horns.  It seems like fate is on their side.  Every week we get closer to a Rose Bowl berth.  If we get to the Rose Bowl I will have a ticket with your name on it if you can get away.  Are you going to be able to catch the game this weekend?  BTW, are you still in Hawaii?

Hope all is well.

Your Pal,

Eric

Gentlemen and ladies,

Check it out, OSU beat OU (NO ONE thought THAT was possible) we are going to 
the Big 12 Championship game VS. Colorado.

Damn we're smooth.

Hook'em Horns.

Brett.

AUSTIN -- Texas coach Mack Brown was channel surfing through college 
football Saturday, hoping his team would get a break.

It wasn't too long before his television was locked in on the second half of 
Oklahoma State's 16-13 upset of Oklahoma.

His phone was ringing off the hook as the final seconds ticked down. Brown's 
fifth-ranked Longhorns were now Big 12 South Division champs and headed to 
the conference title game next Saturday against Colorado.

"I had some players calling and screaming with 20 seconds left," Brown said.

"Our two sons and my wife were screaming and shouting like they were on the 
sidelines. We had some unsportsmanlike conduct there, I think."

Brown said he tried to stay calm after the Cowboys took the lead in the 
final two minutes. He was trying to figure out how many timeouts and how 
much yardage the Sooners needed to pull off the victory or at least tie and 
send it to overtime.

"That's what coaches do," Brown said. "We're trying to figure out how to win 
the game."

Ranked 11th or higher all season, Texas (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) had been on the 
outside looking in at the South division title. The Sooners handed Texas its 
only defeat back in October and had the head-to-head advantage before 
Saturday.

The Sooners were heavy favorites to beat Oklahoma State before the loss 
dropped the Sooners to 10-2 overall, 6-2 in the Big 12.

"You really don't know in this crazy game of college football what's going 
to happen," Brown said. "As of yesterday, nobody thought Colorado and Texas 
would be in this ball game."

Colorado (9-2, 7-1) won the North division with its 62-36 whipping of 
Nebraska on Friday, a game the Texas players could listen to on their way 
home from a 21-7 win over Texas A&M.

The Longhorns defeated Colorado 41-7 back in October. Brown said the rematch 
should be much closer.

"We won the game handily but they had some turnovers early in the game. 
Obviously they're playing much better now than they were then," he said.

Colorado coach Gary Barnett said his team is happy to have another crack at 
Texas.

"We'll be primed for the rematch," Barnett said. "We know we didn't play 
very well the first time and we'd like to think that wasn't who we really 
are."

sounds like a good job. i am glad you are enjoying it.  i haven't taken any big vacations lately, mostly to austin.  i did go to new orleans for a wedding recently but other than that nothing.  the girls sound like they are well.  tell them i said "hi".

good talking to you
-e

  some accounting and billing, but i'm working in the commercial group doing
advertising and support to the engineers for the most part.  the company is

great, we just celebrated 15 years of business last month. it is a small
firm, and many of the staff members are pretty young, i am still the
youngest, however.  i found the job online, and i liked it after the first
interview.

my sisters are doing great, jacqui is a senior at lamar, and dominique is
working towards her last year of school and then she has a year of student
teaching. she has been dating hunter sage for almost 3 years now.  he is in

his first year of law school at UT.  jacqui's boyfriend of a year and 2
months (they celebrated last week) is also a senior at lamar.  really great

guy! i think when i buy the townhouse, dominique will probably move in with

me, her student teaching is unpaid, so she will be looking for a free
place,
i'm sure.  jacqui is not sure about next year, she wanted to go to art
school in new york, and my family took a vacation there in august of this
year, but now with everything going on, she is not sure.  i think i may
start taking some graduate classes next fall at U of H, but i'm still
researching what i want to study.  any vacations for you recently?

i'm really glad you wrote me back, i've been thinking about you and
wondering what you have been doing for a while.  take care.

danielle

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

this is an old one but a great one.

way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

Also, in bankruptcy, who is the first to be paid? Specifically, are employees first in line?

Thanks

http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/pages/releases/006/112701_02.html

thanks for the offer.  i think some guys at work are going to get drinks today.  you are welcome to join if you like.  if not, i will take a rain check on your offer.
 

Hi Son. If you want some whiskey, I will buy. Let me know. Love-Dad

Tom (my boss) does not have any documentation with regards to the bonus, but will make an effort to get it when things quiet down.  He did, however, tell me that it is clear to him that this money cannot be touched by Enron because there were discussions in the past few days about trying to get at the money for credit issues and that was not an option available to the company.

What do you think?

_Eric

Hey Brett,

Good to hear from you.  It is pretty bad at Enron.  I still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now.  The good news is that my division (trading ops) is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition.  The bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts.  It is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money.  
Oh well, things will work out.

As far as the Rose Bowl, I think we have a pretty good shot.  Currently we are 3rd in the BCS rankings (the top two go to the National Championship game -- which is the Rose Bowl this year).  The two teams ahead of us are Miami (1) and Florida (2).  If either one loses (Miami at Virginia Tech this week and Florida vs Tennesee and possible SEC championship game) we should get into the top 2.  Of course, we have to win on Saturday as well.  This has been a wacky year in college football, so I think our chances are pretty good.

Good luck on the proposal.  You are about to venture to the Dark Side.  Telluride should be fun.  We went there last year for a ski trip (again).  I might be venturing down that path soon.

I should be here when you are in town so drop me a line or give me a call (H: 713-661-2601 or Cell:713-628-3104 or Work (hopefully): 713-853-0977).  

Take Care.

Eric

Hey Eric,

Christ almighty, u still got a job?  I bought into Enron at $38 or so..... 
now they're at 0.61.  I really know how to pick'em.  I lost about 1,300 on 
ENE.  I should get to watch the game this saturday and am pretty pumped 
about it.

What all events would have to occur for us to get a Rose Bowl slot?

Yeah, I'm still in HI for another year to year and a half.  I'm going to 
Telluride with Marilyn from 22 Dec to 27 Dec to do the whole proposal thing 
then I leave Hou on the 2nd of Jan.  So if ur in town from 27 dec to 02 jan 
lemme know.

-eric

That is terrible news. Do you know who he was and what role he played? 
 
Eric, if you are contacted by anyone in the news media to discuss with and interview you related to Enron, I strongly recommend that you have no comments to make. I see no upside to you being mentioned in the papers or elsewhere. -L 
 
 
 
 
 

Just heard on the news that former Enron exec, Cliff Baxter, committed suicide this a.m.  That makes me ill.  LU

You are invited to join in the excitement of Texas in the Big XII Championship game this Saturday at 7 PM at my apartment.  We will provide the food.  Let me know if you guys are interested.

My apartment is at 4848 Pin Oak Pk.  #1503  Houston 77081.

goto mapquest.com for directions.

-Eric

you are a dick!

Texas stinks!  As I said before, Chris Simms is the best 5 yard passer in college football history.  When the game is on the line, he chokes!  After he turned the ball over 4 times, he had to fake like he sprained his pinky so that he could go and cry on the sideline.  Texas had to call on their savior from Baton Rouge, but it was a little too late for Major to erase the mistakes of Sissy Simms.

Oh well, I have to get my licks in while I can.  Geaux Tigers!

I got the cashiers check for the full amount and deposited it at Fidelity.  I am just waiting for it to post to my account now.

-E

A friend and I were debating about payroll in a bankruptcy type situation.  I said that there were no guarantees with regards to payroll until the courts approve it.  He said that payroll was an administrative expense and therefore should be guaranteed?  What do you think?

we play the broadband ballers at 9.  anyone interested? do you think they'll show?  let me know

sure.  have you decided on what you would like us to bring?

Hi Eric,
 
Would you and Shanna please do me a huge favor on the way over on Saturday?  Please stop at Kroger or Randall's and buy 5 or 6 balloons for Dad's birthday.  I sure would appreciate that and I am sure he will too.  LU-M

that is nice to hear.  i will look forward to speaking with her.

Hi Eric,
 
How are you today?  
 
Aunt Twila called this morning to see how you were doing and Andrea called last night.  Twila said she will probably call you this evening.  You have some very thoughtful, loving people in your life.
 
Have a wonderful day.  I love you, Mom

what do you think?
Hi Eric,
 
Would you and Shanna like to meet us for dinner at McCormick and Schmidts tomorrow night?  LU-M

I like issey miyake and acqua di gio.
 
-e

What kind do you like and what kind do you absolutely dislike??  LU-M

Hey,

How are things going with you guys?  We really enjoyed Saturday night out at the house.  We should get together more often.

How is Mr. Hamilton doing ? I was thinking of sending some flowers to either the hospital (if he is out of ICU) or the house.  Can you give me the address of either?

Love,
E

Harry,

Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  Things are so bad at work right now. I have nothing to do whasoever.  I get in to work around 9 am and leave around 12:30 every day.  I hope all is going well in the job search.

I saw your add/drop request for the Pats. If you want me to add the Steelers as well just let me know.

Also, you might want to practice, "Would you like to SuperSize that?"

-Eric

Eric:

I trust everything is going well as Enron.  I am actively pursuing a job out
here at Mcdonalds.  "Would you like fries with that"...I practice on a
regular basis.

In any case, I would like to pick up the Patriots Defense and the Steelers
Defense as free agent pick ups, if still possible.  I would like to drop
Engram and the Titans defense. Please let me know.

Thanks
Harry Bucalo

we need a fourth again

I am ok with tomorrow.  Sorry I haven't been able to set lunch up. These crossword puzzles have really kept me busy.

-Eric

Since Mr. Bass didn't follow through on our social engagement, I thought I would do so.  Is anyone interested in lunch?  Is tomorrow too early for you all or should we shoot for next week?  Mr. Hull and I are both available tomorrow.  You guys let me know.  We'll have to go dutch (no more expense report) or one of you UBS people with your big bonuses will have to pick it up!

Let me know.

I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.  

Sorry guys

i agree with your comments about managament.  it seems like they are caught like a deer in a headlights.  i have bought some more shares today.  my view is that the company will not fold.  the worst case scenario is a buyout. so, it seems like we should bottom out shortly.  right?
 
good news on uncle george

Well, I certainly called this one wrong! I was absolutely convinced that the market was drastically overeating to that ENE/partnership deal, that all was above board and that ENE could and would financially manage the matter. However, the stock has lost 50% of its value in less than 4 trading days and 90% of its value in less than a month and yet there is TOTAL silence from management. All you read are the doom and gloom wall street  articles. I must now believe they are true. Are these guys just a bunch of crooks? I guess I should  just take the lump. As much as I hate to,it may be the wise thing to do and try to salvage $8/share. Any thoughts?
 
On a lighter note, talked with Uncle George and he will be delighted to join us for Thanksgiving. Told him I would let him know when we will eat. That's about all for now. LU-:L
 
 
 
 
 

Hi Dear,

Brian.   Things are pretty hectic right now.  There is a lot of uncertainty about the future.  Dynegy acquired Enron (it is so odd to say that) for its trading business and EES so I think my position is safe for the time being.  Up until the acquisition was formalized it was pretty depressing at work, but things have started to pick up again.  I am glad to hear that classes are going well - keep the seat next to you warm because I may be forced up there pretty soon.  Of course, now that Enron's name has been dragged through the mud it will probably be a little more difficult to go to a good B-school.  Good luck on finals and keep in touch.
 
Your Pal,
 
Eric

Hey, Eric.  How are things in Houston?  I can't believe everything that's going on at Enron right now.  Who ever would have thought Enron would be appealing to Dynegy to buy them?  I'm sure things are pretty crazy right now.  Are you planning to stay on if this goes through?  Not too much new to report here.  Classes are going well, but they're keeping me busy as usual.  It's starting to get really cold here, so I'm going to miss the Houston winter.  I just got an email from Ashley that he and Lani got engaged a couple of days ago.  I doubt you see them too often, but I thought you'd be interested.  Hope things are going well for you.

Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest" 

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

Sounds good to me. Right now there could be no golf. I look(and feel) like
the Mayflower settler who lost the fight with the Indian but woke up in time
to save  a PART of his scalp.  However, if things progress okay should be
ready to play by next Wed. I assume the course is closed on Thanksgiving, so
lets plan on playing around noon or so on Wed. That okay with you? Love-Dad

I am off work starting next Tuesday, so I will probably come out to the
house Wednesday afternoon sometime.  Do I need to bring anything?

Dad, do you want to play golf, assuming you are up to it of course?

don't you feel better about the whole situation now?

Nov. 12, 2001, 10:23PM
Jackson says coalition wants role in energy deal 
By NELSON ANTOSH 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Activist Jesse Jackson says the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition intends to be a part of the regulatory process leading to the closing of the Enron-Dynegy deal. 
The organization, which he founded, owns Enron stock and shares in several other large Houston-based energy firms. 
"Dynegy needs our participation to get approval," Jackson said Monday. 
The organization's interest in the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is in assuring minority inclusion in any possible spinoffs, employment, contract commitments and EEOC rulings. 
Jackson is here for the first annual energy summit conducted by the Houston bureau of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Wall Street Project. The summit continues today in the Hyatt Regency downtown. 
Those companies played a role in this conference that suggests they are in touch with Jackson already. On Monday he praised Enron head Ken Lay's integrity although the Enron executive is on the other end of the political spectrum. 
Lay and Dynegy's chief executive officer, Chuck Watson, would have been at the group's energy summit if it weren't for the announcement last week that turned everything topsy-turvy, Jackson said. 
The coalition opened its Houston bureau in May on Smith Street so it can do research, go to annual meetings and distribute information, Jackson said. 
Protests and boycotts are not part of the plan, said William-Paul Thomas, the bureau chief here. 
The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, which Jackson heads, has taken an interest in energy and Houston in particular, as demonstrated by his appearance at the Offshore Technology Conference here early this year. 
Blacks and Hispanics have been locked out of employment, upper-level management and contracts, Jackson said. 
Jackson lamented the lack of emphasis on energy security now that the nation's attention has turned to terrorists and anthrax. 
He also took the opportunity, in an interview, to criticize President Bush's plans for stimulating the economy from the top down, with a tax plan that will benefit large corporations to the tune of billions of dollars. 
"It must be bottom up," Jackson said. 
One-third of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's idea for economic stimulation is travel vouchers, worth $1,000 each and good for up to six months. 
This would help employment in the hard-hit travel and vacation industries during the holiday season, he said. 

Thanks,
Mary

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

i will just come out tomorrow and we will celebrate.  we will get together some other time with shanna

Hi Dear Son,
 
Thank you for the invitation. It sounds like Shanna has planned a nice romantic dinner for two.  I am sure it will be lovely.   Let's all get together next week and have an informal family celebration.  Is that o.k. with you?  Love you, Mom

How about we all go to dinner at Mark's on Sunday night?  How does that sound?
 
-Eric

Hi Eric,
 
It looks like Enron employees have an enterprising spirit according to the H. Chronicle.  Ebay is saturated with Enron goodies.  This is quite amusing.
 
Sorry about tonight and we will miss you on your birthday.  We will celebrate whenever you wish, just let us know.  If you change your mind about tomorrow, email me.  Donnita and Jason are coming over for dinner.  We would love for you to come.  
 
Have a wonderful day.  LU-M

-eric

Hey!  Hope you had a good weekend.  I played some golf to get ready for you 
and Bryan.  Amy and I are putting up the tree right now and listening to 
some Christmas music (Neil Diamond rocks).  If you are out in Sugar Land, 
you should stop by Monday night or Tuesday before we play golf.  I don't 
think you've ever seen the house.  It's a good thing Christmas is here.  A 
time of hope.  Something we probably all need around Enron.  Our home number 
is 281-343-8233.  You could even check out the available homes around us.  
Talk to you soon.

Dave

You owe $80 for fantasy football.  When can you pay?

FYI- since you didn't take care of business

Since you never gave me the $20 for the last time we bet on CU/Texas, I figured I would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round.  I think the line is Texas -9.  Let me know.

surprising . . .

that sounds good 9 it is.  we will go for beers regardless

Alright,  I'll take the bet.  I'll have to scrounge around to find 40 buck though!  You know you're stealing money from my severance!  I may need that to eat on by the end of the week.  If you say the line is 9, that works for me.  CU is on a role....it's time for Simms to go down!

If you steal my money, you'll have to buy me a beer.

How about we all go to dinner at Mark's on Sunday night?  How does that sound?

Hi Eric,
 
It looks like Enron employees have an enterprising spirit according to the H. Chronicle.  Ebay is saturated with Enron goodies.  This is quite amusing.
 
Sorry about tonight and we will miss you on your birthday.  We will celebrate whenever you wish, just let us know.  If you change your mind about tomorrow, email me.  Donnita and Jason are coming over for dinner.  We would love for you to come.  
 
Have a wonderful day.  LU-M

as we talked about yesterday, i am still at enron.  while i have a job, i am trading natural gas futures and other derivative instruments.  i am living off of newcastle and 59 in the Gables Pin Oak.  it is very nice - especially since i don't have a roommate any more.  
glad to hear that the family is doing well
what are you doing at your new job?  accounting?
what about the firls - what are they doing?

no, no more motorcycles.  i'm working for an engineering consulting firm
near the galleria, and i really enjoy it.  i've been here several months,
and it seems to fly by.  my lease was up at the gables at the end of
october, so i have been looking for a townhouse for the last couple of
months.  i've found several i like, but none i'm extremely crazy about.  for
thanksgiving, i went and delivered food for meals on wheels with Oma, and
then ate with my family.  it was really nice.  the girls are so grown up
now!  mom and dad are getting along better than ever!  i got some of my
christmas shopping done over the weekend as well.  other than that, not too
much else going on in my life. for once in my life, i feel as though i don't
have much stress.  it is actually a wonderful feeling!  what about you?
where are you living, etc?

Norman (AP)

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

are you telling me that you want me to buy and you will pay me back?
Well the bottom one I think would be best.  Amazon has free shipping now.  But I just Saw that Best Buy has it for 188 instead of 199.
 
whatever you think - just let me know
or this is the best one for the money.

Something to do with Bob Hebert's finance committee.  LU-M

why can't dad make it?

Hi Eric,
 
Sorry but Dad can't make it Thursday night.  Would dinner here on Friday be o.k. with you?  Dad suggested games, etc., and I wanted to bake a birthday cake.  We can either order in or I would love to cook anything you would like.  It's up to you.  Let me know.  
 
Have a great day.
 
Love, Mom

thats fine just let me know what i owe
No, I can go to Best Buy and get it.  I just wanted to make sure you were still in.  If you want to just order it, you can, but I was just making sure it was what you wanted to do.

Hi Aunt Bonnie,
 
It is great to hear from you.  We really missed the fact that your trip was delayed because of 9/11.  Things will be pretty hectic this weekend with Jason's bachelor party and my birthday.  We are going to dinner tomorrow night for my birthday to a restaurant that I have never tried. It should be good.
 
On Saturday, we will be celebrating Jason's bachelor party.  We are going on a casino cruise out of Galveston.  I am looking forward to it.  
 
When do you think that you are going to make it down for a visit?  How is the weather treating you up there?
 
It was nice to hear from you.
 
Love,

Eric

Hi Eric,

I know this weekend will be a busy one for you but I just wanted to wish you an early Happy Birthday.  Hope all is well with you and Shanna.  I hope to see you in a few months.

Love   Aunt Bonnie

OK the final plans have been made for the bachelor party.  We will meet at 5 pm SHARP at Cinemark Theaters on Richmond and Sam Houston Parkway (Beltway 8).  This is the movie theater across the street from Jason's apartment.  You need to be there on time so that we can make the cruise.

Let me know if you have questions.

-Eric

I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.  Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Eric,
 
I am excited that you will get back to work now.  I know you don't like being bored.
 
Sorry about Tahoe.  Las Vegas sounds interesting.  I'll talk to Dad.  I talked with Vivian this morning and we are planning on a golf trip maybe to Mexico.  I don't know when we will be going.  Las Vegas is not my first choice for a vacation after such a long time without one.  However, I welcome any opportunity to spend time with our son.  I'll talk with him tonight and let you know.
 
Have a great weekend.  Hi to Shanna.
 
Love you, Mom

Thanks.  Of the two - I think UBS is better.  It seems like they are a smaller, more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective.  It should be good.  Of course, anything is better than the way it has been.
 
We are not going to be able to go to Tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss, so we are planning on going to Las Vegas from Feb 13-16.  The airfare is $200/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $100/night (or the bellagio for $200/night). We were wondering if you guys would be interested in joining us?
 
Let me know.

Are you happy??  Congratulations!  LU-M

Hey Brian,

The auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow.  It looks like it will be either UBS or Citigroup.  As far as our friends go: Bryan Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't;  Matt Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; Tim Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; Chad got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to India to teach English to young Indians (how crazy is she?); and Shanna still has a job at Enron in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.
 
I think that just about covers everything.  I am sure that you have talked to Lenny and know his situation.  How is Hector holding up? I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.
 
BTW, Jason (my bro) get married in February.
 
Keep in touch-
Eric

Eric,

Good to hear from you.  Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.  

Glad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?  

My dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.  

Enjoy the downtime while you have it.  Say hello to your family for me.  

Brian

We are still wating on Bankruptcy court to decide our future.  The Dynegy deal fell through a couple of months ago.  My division (trading ops) will most likely be sold to either UBS or Citigroup.

Keep in touch.

to next season.  How are you hangnin with this Enron fiasco?  You workin fer 
Dynergy now?

We're rollin to the field tomorrow, I'll drop ya a note when we get out.

How are things otherwise?

Mom said you needed it:

2210 W. Dallas St., #212
Houston, Texas, 77019

Alright last e-mail:

We got clarification on the rooms.  The Pkg deal stays the same but if you want to get just the room with 2 breakfasts each day it is $79/night - if you want the Premium Room ( the only difference is that the Premium room has jets in the tub) then it is $103/night with no breakfast $115/night with breakfast.

no i am just hearing that most everyone got promoted

i have no idea.  did you hear he was?

just wondering - mainly i was wondering if matt smith is a manager now?

i don't know.  why?

who all got promoted on your desk?
http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~rahjr79/ninja.htm

I forgot to mention that if you do not buy the pkg then lift tickets are about $55/person per day.
I think we will probably just book the room and worry about the lift tickets ourselves.

Here is the info:

Mar 10-14

Caesars Tahoe
Pkg rate is $300 for the first two nights and $172 for each additional night so - $644 total for 4 nights.
The Pkg includes two lift tickets per day (3 total per person), voucher for the use of the spa daily, 2 daily brucnh buffets
This is for the Regular Room

Regular rate for regular room is $79/night 

Regular Rate for Jacuzzi Room is $89/night Sun through Tues and $145 for Wed

the regular rates do not include anything but the room

Airfare
Continental offer nonstop for $370/person - flight time is 3.5 hours
Other airlines offer 1 stop service for $275/person - flight time is 7 hours

Let me know when you decide

Do you want to go to dinner on Friday with us and some friends.  Lil' Papasitos on Kirby.

Hey Mom,
 
Things are going well.  I heard you guys had a good time at the shower.  
I don't know Michael's address but I will get it.

I still haven't heard from you guys regarding the Bachelor Party.
Let me know
The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party. 

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

-Eric

Hey Brian,

Long time no hear.  How are things at Harvard?  I trust you had a good holiday period.  Are you still in Kentucky or back in Boston?
How was the first round of finals?

Things are good down here.  I stayed in Houston for the holidays.  I still have a job.  The big date for us (in the trading group) is this Friday. That is when the bankruptcy court decides who is the best bidder for the trading group.  Hopefully we will get back to work sometime soon after that.  I really have done now work for the past 2 months.  Mostly just sitting around and researching mutual funds and doing crossword puzzles.  I have been coming in to work around 9 and leaving at about 2 everyday.

What oral surgeon did you go to to get your wisdom teeth out? Tim needs to get his out and was wondering if you recommended the surgeon that did yours?

Drop me a line when you get a chance.

-Eric

actually- i forgot to take the $40 out- so $184.50

Hey Bass, what's up? I hope you had a nice Christmas/New Year's.  So, what
does second place pay? and what do I owe for that other league? and I owe
you $40 (20 for the Auburn LSU tickets, and 20 for Texas ending up higher in
the polls than LSU, I'll admit that bet was a lot closer than I thought it
would be at the end of the season, Geaux Tigers!!) So let me know if I still
have any money coming to me or if I'm in the red. Take it easy,
Bryan

Hey Harry,

How are things?  Have you found a job yet?  I trust the holidays went well for you.

Anyways,  I have a check for $74 for FFL - where can I send it?

-Eric

just wondering - mainly i was wondering if matt smith is a manager now?

i don't know.  why?

who all got promoted on your desk?
http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~rahjr79/ninja.htm

how do you want me to get the check to you?

you owe $80 for the league.  $120 for dues minus $40 for winning the league pool one week.
do you agree?

hey brian,
the holidays were good.  it wasn't really that big of a break for me b/c we are still doing nothing at work.  how were your's? and how is the job search going?
i am still trying to figure out the payouts for the league.  i think that you get 25% of the pot for 2nd place.
the tigers' future looks pretty bright - esp with spurrier gone now.  how do you think they will be next year?
 
 
oh well, i hope things are going well.  lets try to get together for drinks sometime soon.

Sounds good to me. Count me in. I will do the "gourmet" dinner if that is
what the rest want to do. What do you have in mind about transportation to

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party. 

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

-Eric

Congrats on the engagement. Sounds like a great evening.  I hope your holidays went well otherwise.  Sorry I didn't get to see ya.  Next time perhaps.

-Eric

PS I hope you caught the Holiday Bowl - the best game I have seen in awhile.

Hey there y'all.  Hope you had a Merry X-mas and a good New Year's Eve.
I just got back from Texas where I asked Marilyn to marry me (she said yes 
you wacko so don't even ask).  I updated the website with pics and a story 
on how it went down.

Hope you're all doin well, drop me a note when you get the chance.

Hey Joe,

I hope your holidays went well.

No problem.  Thanks for playing.  Hopefully we can keep in touch and have the same people next year.  I will be settling the league up shortly and will send you a check.

How are things going otherwise?

-Eric

Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
"Finances" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

I booked your honeymoon.

 

Now keep in mind that you have $2300 to spend via me.  If you want to pick up the incremental cost yourself then I will book it and you can reimburse.  Or you have two options, you can remove the travel insurance to lower the cost to you or you can book for one less night.  Let me know.

That is the one we want to go on.  So, if you could, yes.

do you want me to book this or what?

quite a story....wmp.

 
 

In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was busily working when a new voice came over the asking for a carry out at check register 4.  Kurtis was almost finished, and 
wanted to get some fresh air, and decided to answer the call.  As he approached the check-out stand a 
distant smile caught his eye, the new check out girl was beautiful.  She was an older woman (maybe 
26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.

Later that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to find out her name.  She came into the break room, smiled softly at him and took her card and 
punched out, then left.  He looked at her card, BRENDA.  He walked out only to see her start walking up
the road.

Next day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a ride home.  He looked
harmless enough, and she accepted.  When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her
again, outside of work.  She simply said it wasn't possible.  He pressed and she explained she had
two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter.
Reluctantly she accepted his offer for a date for the following Saturday.

That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that she was unable to go with
him.  The baby-sitter had called and canceled.  To which Kurtis simply said, "Well, lets take the
kids with us."

She tried to explain that taking the children was not an option, but again not taking no for an
answer, he pressed.  Finally Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children.  She had an older
daughter who was just cute a bug, Kurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair,
he was born a paraplegic with down syndrome.  Kurtis asked Brenda, "I still don't understand why the
kids can't come with us?"  Brenda was amazed.  Most men would run away 
from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities.  Just like her first husband and 
father of her children did.

That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and the movies.  When her son
needed anything Kurtis would take care of him.  When he needed to use the rest room, he picked him
up out of his chair, took him, brought him back.  The kids loved Kurtis.  At the end of the evening,
Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her life with.
A year later, they were married and Kurtis adopted both of her children and since they have added two more
kids.

So what happened to the stock boy and check out girl?
Well, Mr. & Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays 
quarterback.

that is disgusting - you are a pervert

trying to gauge interest for a get together at my place for the saints tonight.

let me know

Do you still think that Colorado is going to win straight up?

I have bought my suits from a custom tailor for years, though have not
bought a suit for several years. I recommend Wall Street Clothiers, Pat
McLaughlin, 281-360-7891. Price is reasonable. He comes to you with swatches
and style books. You do not leave your office. Dad

Where is a good place to buy a suit?  Where do you shop? A friend of
mine is asking.

Thanks,
Eric

i'll ask

although he may be a little out of my league

i doubt it - he usually shops in town for his

I'm looking for a suit ... does your dad know a good place to get one in Sugar Land?

Dave

hey plauch, still think it is impossible for this stock to take on a one-handle.  just read below.

new orleans was fun.  the wedding was nice and it was good to get away for the weekend.  how was your weekend?
as far as enron, i think long term it is a buy, but wall street has no confidence in managament and there is definately a negative sentiment.  i think in the short term we will definately see the teens.
-e
 
 

How was your trip? Unless it is discovered that Enron has done something illegal or committed shareholder fraud (each of which I find highly unlikely), I think the market has overreacted to the Enron partnership info. I like the price @ 22-23. Dad
 
 
 
 

sorry i am so late in returning the e-mail, but have been on vacation since last wednesday.  as far as enron, it looks like another down day today on the open.  i hate to tell you to sell now, but i wouldn't want to own enron right now.  i could see enron moving down to the teens much easier than moving up to the thirties.  i might just sell now and look to buy backl ower.
 
let me know what you think
 
-e

Good morning. Do you have any advice about whether I should unload ENE? Seems it cannot take a forward step without then taking 3 steps back. I have never seen a company so effectively shoot itself in the foot. What do you think?-L

i just found that you could stay at highland lodge for 4 nights starting dec 13 and receive 4 lift tkts for that time period for $1600 total.  that is not bad ehh?

Hi Eric,
 
I know you must plan ahead for time off.  Perhaps this Dec. is not a good time for me to go.  I keep forgetting that it is sooner than I thought.  My foot will barely be healed by then so I doubt if I would ski.  I know, I don't ski that much anyway but I do like to venture out for 2 days.  I did find a good airfare from Continental, nonstop Houston to Denver at $262 if you and Shanna decide to go.   It requires travel on Tues. and/or Wed.  So, I was looking at Wed. to Tues.  A little longer than we normally stay.  Unfortunately, I saw no deals on the condos.  I really would like to do something for Dad's birthday - that's why I was thinking about Colo. because he loves it so much.  I am not totally ruling it out but I cannot commit at this time.  LU-M

Thanks,

due to the early game this week, please have your add/drops in the system by noon tomorrow (wednesday).

thanks,

brett,
just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that my new e-mail address is eric.bass@enron.com.

hope all is well

-eric

Eric,

Thanks for the note, I do appreciate it.   Every thing is pretty hectic 
here, rumors flyin a mile a minute, but just like everything else in the 
military rumors are just rumors until they actually happen, nothin is ever 
set in stone. You will probably know before I do when and if any forces 
deploy unless they are actually successful at the news blackout they are 
requesting for this one.  We'll see.
Hope you and all your friends came through this okay.

I look forward to one day gettin back there to catch a UT game with ya,

Stay in touch wildman.

Brett.

I thought that you were going Skiing?  The guys we went hunting w/ didn't know what they were doing!  We drank a lot of beer & whisky, played paintball, ate BBQ & sat around the campfire.

Hey,

After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.

"As you will note, the originator attributes to me
certain statements regarding Usama bin Laden and other
matters that are simply inaccurate. Though I would
like to claim the gift of prophesy, I don't have it."

Hey,

I just figures something out.  The only email messages that you are getting, from me, are the ones where I am replying to you.  This is due to I had your email address as shannontyer@msn.net, however, I noticed that your return email address is shannontyer@email.msn.com.

We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole thing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative returns in the future!

So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you having some G.I. problems.  Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie or grab  supper some time. 

Take care,

Don

Enron Executives Blamed For Missing Employee Donut Fund
HOUSTON- The Enron Corp. scandal widened Monday, when The Houston
Chronicle reported that top company executives stole nearly $10 from the
employee donut fund sometime between June and August of last year.
"There should be at least $9.25 in the coffee can next to the filters,"
said Laurie Baker, a recently laid-off Enron employee. "I personally put
$2.50 into that fund, and now it's gone." Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is
already under grand-jury subpoena regarding $45 in Chinese-food-delivery
allocations that mysteriously vanished on Nov. 17, 2001.

Please take me off your email list.

Please be aware that there is a scheduled power outage in ECS this weekend on Saturday, January 19, 2002. The outage is scheduled from 2:00pm - 4:00 pm. 

There should be no impact with the exception of a loss of power to the plasma screens.

 In order to protect the plasma screens from becoming damaged during the power shutdown, technical support will need your assistance in turning off all plasmas in your area this Friday at close of business. Desktop Support technicians will assist with turning back on the plasmas on Tuesday morning, January 22, 2002 starting at 6:00 am (as Monday is a holiday).

I am sending this to the admins in ECS. Please forward to anyone I may have missed and please assist us in spreading the word to anyone who may be working on Saturday. Again, the only impact will be the loss of the plasma screens.

Thank you for your assistance in advance! Please call me if you have any questions/concerns

Three interesting things.  
 
1.  The Steer Starletts Fundraiser we think is  going on this Thursday night.  It is a very good Rodeo social  event.  Lots of honies, free drinks and free food.  I will keep you  posted.  I should find out for sure today that it is going on.
 
2.  The Rodeo Kickoff dance is going on next  Wednesday the 16th.  You and Travis are invited to come with me if ya'll  would like.  Or meet me somewhere in the area.  It starts at 7:30 or  something like that.
 
3.  On Friday night some of us are going to  the Firehouse to celebrate Barbara Prukop's 35th birthday.  Ya'll are  invited to that also.
 
So let me know something about joining us for any  of the above social events.

   Clinton's Beloved Dog Buddy Killed by Car
   NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buddy, the chocolate retriever once seen
bounding
   around the White House gardens with Bill Clinton, was killed by a car
   near the former president's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., police said
   Thursday.
   A police officer said the dog was hit Wednesday afternoon but it was
not
   clear whether it was being walked at the time or had wandered off the
   property owned by Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
   ``His dog was hit by a car ... we received a call yesterday
afternoon,''
   said Sgt. Charles Ferry of the New Castle, N.Y., police that also
covers
   suburban Chappaqua in Westchester County north of New York City.
   The former president's spokeswoman Julia Payne said the Clintons
``are
   deeply saddened by Buddy's death.'' In a statement issued by Payne,
the
   family said, ``He was a loyal companion and brought us much joy. He
will
   be truly missed.''
   Payne said Buddy was 4-1/2 years old and was taken into the White
House
   as Clinton's pet soon after he was born. Clinton left the White House
in
   January 2001 after serving two four-year terms. Hillary Clinton

Hola senorita,

What's goin on with you? Just trying to get this business cranked up!  Yeah I've been busier that an one legged man in an ass kickin' contest!  The weekend was great, I'm pretty sure that I'll join the Krewe of Gambrinus, after Mardi Gras.  What have you been up to?  How was your weekend?  What's goin' on this week.  Find a night when I can cook you supper and have some beer & cider. I've got my sister's birthday party at Mom & Dad's tonight, but open the rest of the week.  Drop me a line when you have a chance.

Take care,

DB

Hey There!! 
What's going on?  How was your weekend? You busy with new company stuff about to kick off?

I hope that we are planning to contest this proposed amendment.

On October 15, 2001, the Midwest ISO filed an amendment to 
Section 17.5 of its Open Access Transmission Tariff to charge 
a fee for non-confirmed transmission service requests for 
transmission service greater than one week. Midwest ISO 
has requested an effective date December 15, 2001.
Interventions and protests are due November 5.

Let me know if you need further information.

Awesome!

Yes, I believe we will.  It is a $1000 penalty -- ridiculous.  We will oppose the concept of a penalty in general, as well as the amount, which seems very arbitrary.  We are also requesting, in a separate proceeding, a moratorium on tariff filings by MISO until the Midwest RTO process has progressed sufficiently to allow meaningful consideration of the tariff.
I am not sure who is doing the writing but we'll run a draft by you.

On the front page of MW Daily today there is an article about the testing of a new hourly index into Cinergy by Platts.  Are you guys participating in the testing?

Guy

Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire
trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.

In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf
Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an  American" signs removed so as
to not offend international students.

I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American
citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we
are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist
attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the
majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely
settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  "politically correct"
crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was
offending others.

I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is
seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's
population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants;
however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our
country, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.

First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to
offend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-cultural
community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national
identity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own
language,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the "American Way"
has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by
millions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought,
bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo
Jima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.

We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any
other language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society --
learn our language!

"In  God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall,
Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is
engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is
printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian  men and
women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearly
documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto to
be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it is
certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.

God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song,
and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrection
as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If God
offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your
new home, because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him.

We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our
freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and
Flag Day. We  have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave
our flag.  As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my
national  anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and
wherever I
choose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam,
then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet.

The American culture is our way of life,  our heritage, and we are proud of
it. We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change, and we
really don't care how you did things  where you came from. We are
Americans, like it or not, this is our  country, our land, and our lifestyle.

Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion
about our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every
opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and
griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life,
I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom,
the  right to leave.

Barry Loudermilk
If you agree, pass this  onto other Americans!!
It is time to take a  stand!!

COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Football practice was delayed on Tuesday
 for nearly two hours at Texas A&M University.

One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to
look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery
substance on the practice field. Practice was immediately suspended by
Coach R.C.
Slocum while the FBI was called in to investigate.

After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign
white substance that they found was the goal line.

 

Congratulations!  That is FANTASTIC!  When is the date?  When will you next be in town?  I'll buy you a beer in celebration.

Take care,

Don

The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) was provided notice at 1200 on 11/2/01 that the termination will occur hour ending 24 on November 3, 2001. At that time, KCPL will no longer be a member of MAPP. KCPL will maintain its membership in SPP as a Transmission Owner under the SPP OATT. This requires a modification of how reservations under the SPP OATT should be made and how associated schedules should be submitted. Only reservations with a POR/POD of KCPL are at issue. SPP wants to take this opportunity to inform our customers of the associated changes. Please see the attached document, which has also been posted on the SPP OASIS page, on how reservations will be treated.

We are currently still evaluating the TradersNews historical data and market conditions pertaining to the viability of such a product.  I will contact you as soon as I am able to move forward with this project on this side.  The best way to reach me is currently via e-mail.

Frank was excited about his new rifle. So, he went bear hunting. He
spotted a small brown bear and shot
it. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a
big black bear. The black bear
said: "You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we have
rough sex."
Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,
Frank soon recovered and
vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black
bear and shot it.
There was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear
stood right next to him.
The grizzly said: "That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two
choices. Either I maul
you to death or we have REALLY rough sex."Again, Frank thought it was
better to
comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before
Frankfinally recovered.
Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzly
and shot it.
He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He
turned around to find a giant polar bear
standing there. The polar bear said: "Admit it, Frank, you don't come
here for the hunting, do you?"

Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle

Amigo,
Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly impact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look like in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due to it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract, about a month ago.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend. =20

?=09Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all n=
ew voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greet=
ings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover=
 the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed whe=
n you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon you=
r arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on. =20

?=09Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Mo=
nday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it=
 is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in o=
n Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who=
 are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names ha=
ve been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday=
.
o=09Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?=09Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the r=
outes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure =
to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you nee=
d additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highligh=
ted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have=
 their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access withou=
t their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via =
the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back throug=
h the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kio=
sk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to=
 ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?=09Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a=
 list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be =
on the floor when we move in. =20
o=09Red - Move Team
o=09Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o=09Green - Telephony

?=09Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subsc=
riptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all =
daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor co=
rridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up =
the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up t=
he papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of EC=
N, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?=09Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more tha=
n about 4  boxes per person. =20

?=09Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any label=
s, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels pr=
inted.

?=09Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been remo=
ved from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are=
 left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to =
move the computers as scheduled.

.=09Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses fi=
ltered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on=
 the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of=
 water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water =
at several locations. =20

?=09Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to =
remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret=
 or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be wa=
iting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might=
 have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much =
for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRID=
AY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with=
 the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

I'm ready for the fishing!  I was able to ride on Joe's boat after he got it, very nice.  It should run very skinny.

I hope all is well.

Later,
DB

Thanks for the invite.  I wish I could make it.  You need to plan a trip
down here for a little fin and feather.  Joe got himself a nice custom
flats and we need to break it in right.  A lot of geese and ducks are
being killed on lake Mathis right now and I'm sure we can manage to find
some trout somewhere.

Happy birthday and drink one for me.

Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.  

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.  I am doing well at Enron, managing the real-time power trading desk and trading.  Enron, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.  

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired! FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?  Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

Thanks for rounding up the tickets for the Orange Bowl.  You can mail them to 
me, or just hold them until I see you after Christmas.  Mike's wife decided 
not to make the trip, so he won't be using the tickets.  Jody Crook will use 
the other two tickets.  

Lunch during the week between Christmas and New Years sounds great to me.  I 
will be working that week, but would be glad to meet you guys at Champions 
for lunch if that is best.  Or if you are game for Irma's, just let me know 
when you would like to come downtown.  

--Sally 

Sally/Mike,

I will be in Houston the week after Christmas (12/26-12/29) and was
wondering if the two of you were going to be in the office, and if so, would
you be available for lunch? In talking with David Beck, he was going to try
to arrange a golf game (Mike, me, Richard Kimberlin and David) one of those
afternoons at Champions. If that is possible, then maybe lunch before golf
might work. If not, then I can meet you downtown when convenient. Let me
know what your schedules are like and I will plan my schedule accordingly.

Also, I need to know if I need to mail the Orange Bowl tickets to both of
you separately or just one of you. Didn't know if you are planning on going
to Miami together? I should receive the tickets in the next day or two and
will do whatever. Ought to be a fun trip, as it has definitely been awhile
since the Sooners have been to Miami.

Anyway, let me know if you are available for lunch/gold or just lunch.

Hope you all have a wonderful holiday season and most of all get to spend
time with your families!

Did Debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo?  Is she 
raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her 
conversations with you two, or did she skip that step?  Just curious, before 
I send any type of response.  I would need details from you around the 
process for updates to Entelligence and Global Counterparty.  Surely one 
feeds the other?  --Sally 

	
	                           
	

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Great - we will look forward to seeing you on the 13th and 14th.  I will work 
on an agenda this week, and will send you something later in the week.  
--Sally

Hey there -- hope the weekend was good.  I think I will still plan to come -- 
as I can handle some of my personal things re: moving home -- house etc.  on 
Thursday Friday and meet up with others on Wed.

So ---- go ahead and pencil me in for Mon and Tuesday the 13th and 14th.

I will assume that you and Patti will mostly fill my calendar on those two 
days, so will have Janine put other meetings the rest of that week.

Will check on the agenda next week, before I leave London.

Thanks

Beth

   

The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San 
Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling 
on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that 
week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to 
know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that 
you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look 
forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.  

We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.  

Have a great weekend.  --Sally 

Beth Apollo
10/24/2000 09:27 AM
Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.

I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.

Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.

What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Beth

Your note has made my day.  Thanks for taking the time to send it.  Your 
thoughts and support mean a lot to me.  How lucky I am to have you for a 
sister and friend!  --Sally 

Sally,

Have been thinking quite a bit about the work news you told me.  We were
talking about you last night with Mom and Dad.  You really have such a great
gift--you must be able to be able to work so hard, focus so concretely, AND
come up with creative solutions AND manage people.

If I haven't said it recently, I am very proud of you!

Love,

Cindy

Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field 
and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for 
your schedule).  I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I 
was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in 
her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it 
done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.  
However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not 
bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to 
make sure she has it in readable form?  I will be in London all of next week, 
and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and 
dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether 
or not you included that on your list.  

Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that 
could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What 
do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 
blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned 
by Irma's son, Luis).  

I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure 
that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as 
well.  

I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see 
at the end of January.  --Sally 

Thanks for the responses -- all look great.  I like coming over knowing that 
my calendar will be pretty full.  Dinner sounds great, too.  I am having 
dinner with Beth Apollo on Monday evening to talk more about her assignment.  
I received a note from Fernley asking about dinner on Thursday evening also.  

Hope that the New York trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was 
smooth.  --Sally

see comments in red - rushed - so please excuse my typos

   

Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the 
issue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change 
systems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process 
and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l, 
new activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of 
books on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process

Also I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at 
same time - more for information on this  - because when we 'solve' market 
risk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure 
reporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 
Would defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues 
trying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is Metals

I would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on 
Wednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for 
Metals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be 
the presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December.

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 
Would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, 
self assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a 
small group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome 
some more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be 
successful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your 
'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR
As explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the 
implementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross 
prioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark 
and Fernley on this would be useful

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE - certainly in 
calendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! )

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 
 - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services - The below is a 
section of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I 
would like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence 
of vision/strategy documentation for CL

Lead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note 
this is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-
Changing Market practices
create cashflow messaging within each transaction
create payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and 
liquidation 
re-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes 
to terms of trade
Module/Application developments
Synergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation 
together )
elimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic 
messaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of 
payment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement  ) and at 
liquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement )

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  Can I suggest we also

I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday - as above 
but would you also be available for dinner with the controllers and Fernley ?

I am glad that you asked!  I will be happy to bring your things back for 
you.  Niki is finding a spot for me to occupy while I am there next week and 
she is coordinating my schedule, so we see one another quite a bit.  It will 
be easy to do this.  --Sally

If your kind offer still stands, I have just thought of something I need from 
London.  I had ordered some beauty products from the salon in the Tonezone 
and they are now in (cleanser, toner and exfoliator).  If it's not too much 
trouble would you mind bring them back for me?  I will have them delivered to 
Niki Scott just in case.  They are already paid for.  If you do not get a 
chance, not to worry, I'll just have them shipped.

Thank you very much.  Have a safe trip.

Nicki

Let's plan on Monday night for dinner.  Someone included me on the 
distribution list for your going away bash, so I have put that on my calendar 
for Wednesday night as well.  --Sally

Frank and I are staying at the Sheraton Belgravia which is about a 5 minute 
walk to our office  -- it is small and quiet but nice rooms.  It is not on a 
major street like Picadilly or Park Lane, but we like it.  The rate is about 
o190 a night

We had to move out of our flat on Monday, so are staying there until we 
leave.  Right now we are scheduled to fly out on Sat the 20th.

Also --- just a few notes on next week

I am free Monday night if you would like to have dinner.  I know Frank and 
Maureen will be in Spain that night, they are back on Tuesday  

Also my going away party that Fernley is throwing is on Wed night -- so 
hopefully most people will drop by there.  It is just a pub thing near the 
office, but hopefully you can make it!  I am sure there will be dinner or 
something afterwards.  

Talk to you soon

Beth

   

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally 

Thanks!  I understand that congratulations are in order for you, too.  We 
should definitely do dinner and celebrate.  I think that Niki has arranged 
that for Thursday night.  I will look forward to it.  --Sally

Hi Sally - and a Happy New Year. Sounds like you, David and the kids had a 
great time (baking - my word you are a lady of many talents!)

I certainly would like to spend some time with you next week and I'll ask 
Niki to work me in to your schedule - I'd love to have dinner one evening if 
that suits.

Congratulations!

Fernley

   

I hope that your holidays were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the week of 
vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the 
children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late 
either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas 
cards.  

I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday 
evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, 
I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, 
and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  

I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the 
major goals for the trip are:

 to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of 
London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within 
Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),

 to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the 
London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year, 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our 
operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and 
other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office 
services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like 
for me to meet.  

Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.  
Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for 
a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this 
week.  

I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, 
I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if 
you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the 
throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to 
finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally 

Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day,

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  
  
I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday.  

Please see following details for Friday's brainstorming session:

Date: Friday, January 12, 2001
Time: 8:30 - 2:00 PM (Continental breakfast & lunch will be served)
Place: Four Seasons Hotel
 1300 Lamar St.
 "Highland" Room (to the right, upstairs to 2nd floor, then left)
Parking: Stamp will be provided in meeting room to validate parking tickets

Thanks,

I hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the 
time to vote.  Also, please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time 
to vote tomorrow.   For those employees who typically work later hours, 
please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office.  
Everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote 
count.  It should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening.  
Hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome.  

This one is pretty funny...

Like you have time to read this... It is really funny.

The other place in San Antonio is Westin's La Canterra.  I will contact both 
and get info.  Then we should make reservations soon.  I'll call Cindy 
tonight and fill her in.  -Sally 

Great!   I will be working late again - but should be home after 7:00 or so-
Talk to you later

I plan to work out of the London office during the week of January 15.  I 
will leave Houston on Sunday and will be in the London office starting around 
noon on Monday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Monday, January 22.  
The primary goals of the trip are:

  to work with Mike Jordan on an action plan to move the close and 
officialization of London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 per my e:mail to you for 
managers and above within Operations),

 to hold a training session for business controllers in the London office who 
will participate in Doorstep   reviews this year (outside EEL), 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

 Patti Thompson (x39106) will have a detailed itinerary in hand if you need 
to reach me at any time next week.  

I love it!!  I think that is perfect.  Much easier for my family and probably 
for everyone else.  That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, 
assuming that works for everyone.  Removing some of the travel hassels should 
mean that everyone would have a better time, too.  Hyatt Hill Country is one 
obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice.  There is 
a newer resort in the area also.  I can't think of the name of it offhand, 
but David knows and I will get the name from him tonight and call you.  
--Sally    

Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could "chip in"
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally 

I will attend the meeting on Thursday, but will have to leave around 1:15 to

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Please see following details for Thursday's operational risk meeting:

Date: Thursday, January 11, 2001
Time: 1:00 - 4:00 PM
Place: Hyatt Regency Hotel

I knew that you would still be in London.  Just thought that I would start to 
copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's 
going on.  Yes, I will be in London next week.  Plan to fly over on Sunday 
night and will be in the office around noon on Monday.  I will be there 
through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday.  Let's 
definitely plan to get together.  I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this 
moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that 
were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my 
schedule for next week.  I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when 
we can get together.  Looking forward to it.  --Sally

I guess you know I am here in London this week wrapping up -- wish I could be 
there for this meeting.

Are you still coming next week?   It would be good to get together.  

Let me know  -- I will try to call this afternoon

Beth

   

Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
will keep you from attending the meeting.      

Thanks for setting this up and for copying me on the schedule.  Hopefully, 
this will be fruitful for everyone.   And maybe unnecessary at some point in 
time!  Thanks.  -Sally 

We are starting the 4-weeks floor support today, 11/2. The time coverage is 
1:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Please see below for the schedule.

Thanks

Zhiyong

   

I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.  

   
	
	

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

Zhiyong

Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  Meagan called this afternoon 
to tell me the news.  I will perhaps get more details when I get home 
tonight.  I hope that Laura and the baby are doing well.  Let us know what we 
can do to help.  I am sure that Jackson is a proud brother.  We will be 
anxious to meet our newest neighbor.  --Sally 

I will be out of town on January 19, so Brenda Herod has agreed to make the

that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
will keep you from attending the meeting.      

Great - I will add her name to the distribution list so that she will get our 
upcoming note on the location for this meeting.  Thanks.  

   

I have invited a new manager, Jill Lafave, who started today.  

   

Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special

I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and 
then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.  So it is gone - but 
not sent!!  Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is 
convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology.  

I know that you left a message with Patti about contacting David Eastlake.  I 
have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not 
get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him.  
The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you. 

Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer 
intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.  
Let me know.  --Sally  

Sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently.  Congratulations on 
the baby!  I hope that you are feeling well.  I am so happy for you and your 
husband.  My how your lives will change!!  But how enriched they will be.  
Our three are so much fun.  I will also always be honest with expectant moms 
and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it 
sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience.   If you ever want 
some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom, just let me 
know.  I would be glad to share my experience with you.  --Sally 

Sounds good to me.  

   

	
	                           
	

yes

   

	
	                           
	

want to reduce the time to 1 hr on weeks we don't have specific 
agenda/speakers?

	
	                           
	

This is a reminder that the next Weekly Risk Forum Luncheon will take place 
Tuesday, January 9th,  from 11:30a.m. to 1:00pm in conference room EB-2868.  
Lunch will be served; consequently, if you are unable to attend please advise 
accordingly.

I will ask Patti to set up a meeting for us this week.  Your name has been on 
my list to call - a trip to the Orange Bowl last week cut my week short, so I 
will look forward to getting with you this week.  --Sally 

   
	
	

Sally,

I'd like to get on your calendar for a brief meeting to discuss the 
organization change resulting from Scott's departure.  I have an idea if you 
have not finalized the new structure.  

I understand that Shona has some international experience and thought we 
could leverage that to our benefit.

One other item that needs to be addressed is our current location on 21.  I 
understand it is highly coveted by Tom Gros for expansion of the Commodity 
Logic team.  
Thank you.

Martha

I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.  It is always great 
to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front 
of you. 

No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after 
graduation.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about 
your offer while you are going through that process.  Enron had a fantastic 
year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  We 
hope that you will be a part of that. 

My number at work is 713-853-5926.  Please feel free to call me any time.  If 
it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend, 
my home number is 281-370-8568.  Don't hesitate to call.

I told  Tom last week that I have a standing systems meeting on Thursdays at 
9:00, so this change doesn't work for me.  Can we try 10:00 am on Thursday 
this week?  Thanks. --Sally 

FYI

Brenda,

Sally has a on-going meeting Thursdays from 9:00 - 10:00 AM (Risk Systems mtg 
w/ Rick Buy, Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman and others - I think it is to deal 
with all the systems problems we have been having lately).

I hope that you are enjoying your break from school, and am sure that it is 
even more enjoyable with that Number 1 ranking decided!  My husband (an OU 
grad) and I were at Orange Bowl, and it was really exciting to be there and 
see the team absolutely stop FSU.  

If you have any questions regarding your job offer from Enron while you are 
on vacation, please give me a call.  2000 was a banner year for us at Enron, 
and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  I hope that you 
will join us and be a part of that.  

My office number is 713-853-5926.  If it is more convenient for you, feel 
free to call me at home as well.  That number is 281-370-8568.

I am so sorry to hear about your dad.  I did not know that he had passed 
away.  I know that he has been very ill.  My thoughts are with you and your 
family.  I know that it must hard to say goodbye to someone that has been 
such a part of your life for so long.  

We will miss you on the 11th, but certainly understand your absence.  --Sally 

   
	
	

Sally,
I will not be able to attend the January 11th meeting.  My dad's funeral is

Absolutely - Clara should have been included.  I asked for a list of managers 
and above within EGM from Chantelle, and used that for the distribution 
list.  Her list omitted Clara.  All lists that I requested from EGM, ENA and 
EIM were to have also included those being promoted to manager as a result of 
our year-end PRC process.  I don't think that I got consistent info from 
everyone, so I am rechecking names right now and will send Clara a message 
about the meeting as I also clean up any others that were left off of lists.  
Thanks for catching this.  --Sally

I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session 
with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.  The purpose of 
this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential 
commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.  I know 
that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be 
marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or 
are currently providing services to outside parties.  While there are efforts 
underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be 
used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office 
services.  I hope that you will be able to attend.  

Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you 
on Monday when Patti returns from vacation.   

I was just thinking about the anniversary thing, too.  I bought a book at 
Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name 
of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought 
looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another 
place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both 
meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get 
info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a 
range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is 
plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc.  
These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough 
variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that 
may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the 
whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well. 

I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the 
thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be 
together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the 
two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is 
doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get 
everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be 
a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if 
there is any place that we could get excited about going.    

Hi, Sally,

Am sure you are swamped having been gone for a while...was glad to see OU
won the game--figured that made it a better trip for you!

Now that we know Dad will be around, shall we rev up the anniversary
planning again--or should we blow it off and do some great present--maybe
just send them somewhere?  Maybe it is just the increased holiday time with
them but Mom and Dad are kind of getting on my nerves right now....am sure
it will pass....

Cindy

I have a standing staff meeting that I attend on Monday mornings, so I will 
not be available when you and James meet on the 8th.  I will look forward to 
getting with James after your meeting for an update.  

Mike Campbell <MCampbell@HDINC.COM> on 01/03/2001 02:50:49 PM
Sally,
Just wanted to give you a quick status report on where we are to date. We
have had two meetings postponed with James, but we are scheduled to meet
again on Monday, January 8th at 9 AM. We will review and revise the written
description our approach and James wants to share that with you after the
meeting. If you are available on Monday, your input would expedite the
review and revision process tremendously.
Thanks,

opinions.  I will ask Patti to schedule a meeting.  --Sally 

Tim O'Rourke@ENRON
11/03/2000 08:29 AM
Sally,
Cindy Olson said you'd be a good person to talk with on this subject, as 
someone who has considerable experience with this concept.
I'm doing some research on the ASE and whether to create something internally 
for Enron use. The key questions are: which would be the aspects we'd keep 
and which would be the aspects we'd discard.?
Can I get 15-30 minutes of your time to discuss in the next week or two?

Tim,

Patti,
If Sally gives the OK, can you call Stacey on 30945 and set up a time please?
Thanks

I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their 
thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.  
Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by 
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the 
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and 
I will follow through on that if you would like.  

Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good 
one for you.  --Sally  

Vince J Kaminski

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for Enron's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have Enron participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,

I have been out of the office at the Orange Bowl game and have just returned 
within the last hour.  That probably would make next week better for me than 
this week.  Give me a call and we will set something up.  My number is

she will be able to set  up a meeting.  Thanks.

Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 
accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let 
me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another 
delivered.  

Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill 
team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional 
attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze.  
--Sally 

I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent 
Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that 
you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice 
mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I 
thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP.  
Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know 
that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for 
me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe 
me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP 
as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally 

I have always worked right up until my due date.  There is a lot of waiting 
and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the 
office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my 
last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' 
Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of 
days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I 
was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week 
late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 
18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of 
course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was 
out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably 
depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have 
everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my 
pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed 
working as long as I could.  

Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater 
before the baby comes.  You won't be able to do that for quite a while 
afterwards!! 

Hi, Sal.  It's kind of a drag coming back to work after Christmas, huh?   I
am wearing my new denim maternity shirt today!   Thanks to my sister, Sally,
I have a decent maternity wardrobe to carry me through several more months!
On that note, I have a question for you:  I am trying to schedule the next
few months and wondered what your advice is on working up until the due
date.  Would you advise working up till the date?   Or taking a couple weeks
off before?    -Cara

I saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a 
completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis 
that this will be kept up.  I sent the note below to Kim.  I am sure that she 
manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full 
responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the 
organization.   It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will 
call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be 
completed.  That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't 
address that.  If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she 
should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that 
at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing 
the task.  

Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one 
that gets the phone calls.  The ENA organization must develop confidence in 
others on our team.  Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to 
imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly 
communicate information that addresses his needs.   Thanks.  

Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the 
notation is that information is being compiled?  My guess would be that the 
one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest 
number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is 
still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner?  
As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to 
do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done 
promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent 
Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get this caught 
up.  

Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle the RMT 
Confirmations?   Will we have some sort of report that we can send to Stephen 
each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is 
comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date?  --Sally 

   Kim S Theriot                12/27/2000 05:51 PM

Stephen,
As a follow-up to my earlier voicemail message, the status of the RMT 
Confirmation Project is as follows:

Financial Gas:           RMT Confirmations complete through December 1999
   Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 2000
Financial Power:      RMT Confirmations complete through November 2000
Financial Weather
and Liquids:  Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 1999 and 2000
Financial FX:                       Laurel Adams is assessing the work to 
compile the data for 1999 and 2000

From this point forward, the RMT Confirmation will be prepared on a monthly 
basis for each commodity. 

As far as the Year End RMT Project, I spoke with Bob Bowen this morning as to 
the status.  What he told me was that he was supposed to receive a file 
containing the deal information of the deals involved.  This was per the 
meeting that he attended last week.  As of this morning he had not received 
anything He stated that he was expecting the file last week but never 
received any information.  He was going to follow-up with the appropriate 
individual.  I will give you an update in the morning to make sure that he 
has the data needed to complete the project.  

If you have any further questions, please call me at ext. 31771.

Lexi:  In our meeting last week, I thought that we handled both Greg and 
Ryan, and were comfortable with Round 1 interviews only (2 interviewers) with 
this disposition:  Greg as a keeper (wasn't he the one who worked in the 
career center?) and no to Ryan.  

I will be glad to do a phone interview this week with 

   

Dear Interviewers:

As a follow-up from campus interviews, the following candidates still need to 
be screened:

Greg Carlson and Ryan Morrison -- Need round 2 interviews
Matthew Hutchison -- Needs round 1 and round 2 interviews

Please let me know if you are interested in interviewing these candidates via 
telephone this week.

Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the 
notation is that information is being compiled?  My guess would be that the 
one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest 
number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is 
still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner?  
As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to 
do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done 
promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent 
Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get his caught 
up.  

Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle for the 
RMT Confirmations?   Will we have some sort of report that we can send to 
Stephen each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he 
is comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date?  
--Sally

Stephen,
As a follow-up to my earlier voicemail message, the status of the RMT 
Confirmation Project is as follows:

Financial Gas:           RMT Confirmations complete through December 1999
   Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 2000
Financial Power:      RMT Confirmations complete through November 2000
Financial Weather
and Liquids:  Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 1999 and 2000
Financial FX:                       Laurel Adams is assessing the work to 
compile the data for 1999 and 2000

From this point forward, the RMT Confirmation will be prepared on a monthly 
basis for each commodity. 

As far as the Year End RMT Project, I spoke with Bob Bowen this morning as to 
the status.  What he told me was that he was supposed to receive a file 
containing the deal information of the deals involved.  This was per the 
meeting that he attended last week.  As of this morning he had not received 
anything He stated that he was expecting the file last week but never 
received any information.  He was going to follow-up with the appropriate 
individual.  I will give you an update in the morning to make sure that he 
has the data needed to complete the project.  

If you have any further questions, please call me at ext. 31771.

Kim Theriot

Thanks for letting me know.  I am sure that you have communicated with the 
Portland risk group regarding this slip up.  What assurances have you gotten 
from them about their diligence in the future in officializing books?  Do you 
think that everyone there is on board and aware of how important this is?  
--Sally 

   
	
	

I just wanted to let you know that the West Risk Management group did not 
officialize one of their calculations last night.  I have had calls from 
Credit & VAR.  The Interest Rate group was not affected because their new 
system caught the error and the were able to use yesterday's cash flows.  I 
officialized the book this morning and everyone is rerunning their 
applications.  I'll let you know if there is any other fall out.

I am meeting with Shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews 
for the first quarter.  As long as the New York review isn't the week of 
January 15th, then I think I will still target that week for a London trip.  
Don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me  - I know that you 
are very busy, so I expect that we will work in time together around critical 
things that you need to handle.  I will try to send you a list of topics that 
I would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting 
point.  You may have some suggestions on others that I should meet with while 
I am there.  Thanks.  --Sally

Hope you had a good week - mine was enjoyable despite illness in the family 
and a houseful of guests. I am also grateful for the opportunity to get back 
to work!!

As to your visit

I will try to clear the week - the only potential curveball is my desire to 
be in NY when we do the NY doorstep( timing is uncertain ). I want to hammer 
home the need for absolute clarity re the remote office control structure and 
to review the SAP implementation work - both should be in place .

I will put together a list of issues/subjects that I would like to update you 
on over the next day or so  - we should be able to use that as a working 
agenda and a start point for scheduling time.

If there is anything else you would like to review specifically, I will get 
the necessary preparation done.

Cheers and Happy New Year

Mike

   

Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

   

	
	                           
	

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

To continue to keep you in the loop - looks like Mike is moving in the right 
direction on this --Sally

You should see this reply from Mike -- it is more positive than the response 
from James New.  Sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on 
required changes to processes, systems, commercial practices, etc. to move to 
a same day calculation of their books.  Mike and I have talked about this as 
a longer term goal for the London office and I knew that he was working with 
James and others to come up with a plan and a timeline.  I expect to review 
that with Mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion.  
That is why you haven't yet seen the document.  --Sally

Unfortunately, I will miss your farewell at Slick Willie's on January 3rd.  I 
am sorry that I won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off, but 
perhaps we can have one in London later in January as your welcome to 
London.  I will be in Miami on January 3rd, hopefully celebrating an Oklahoma 
win in the Orange Bowl earlier that day.  David found us tickets to the 
game.  Not great seats, but they are in the stadium.  Hey, it's not UT, but 
it should still be fun to go.  

I will miss you and your wit and constructive cynisism in Houston.  But I 
know that I can count on you to be just as vocal from London!  I plan to be 
there at least quarterly in 2001, and will definitely welcome your first hand 
observations on operational areas that may need attention.  Hopefully between 
e:mail and voice mail we can definitely keep in touch.  

Tell Ann that I hope that this will be a great adventure for her and the 
whole family.  I think that it is a wonderful time in your children's lives 
to give them this experience.    Have fun -- and set them straight!! 

Thanks for including me in the invitation to Slick Willie's.  Unfortunately, 
I will not be able to attend.  I will be at the Orange Bowl in Miami and will 
not return until the morning of the 4th.  

We are making some progress with the timeliness of London information.  More 
to come...

I appreciate the flash P&L that you are now providing.  That should help 
everyone get an early morning picture of what is going on in London.  Have 
you had an opportunity to address the need for European VaR numbers at the 
same time in the morning?

James New
12/18/2000 01:07 AM
We in London shall be producing a flash P&L from today Monday the 18th of 
December. This will be sent to Shona's group at 1pm London time which 
Ibelieve is in good time for the P&L consolidation group.

Any queries please let me know.

All,

We are shifting from SAP pay entity 0530 to 1021 on January 1, 2000.  As part 
of this process, we will be sending ALL MANUAL WIRES for GBP and EUR and all 
intercompany payments for the first week of January.  Corporate Treasury does 
not want to open new bank accounts, but we will need our existing accounts 
configured for company 0530 until December 2000 close.  Once December 2000 is 
closed, we will be back to sending payments though the system.

Mary Perkins has agreed that the Treasury group will accept all manual 
wires.  

We will do our best not to inundate you with wire requests throughout the 
day, but instead bring them in batches.    Thank you very much for your 
understanding and assistance!

If possible, could you please let me know via email or a phone call if you 
will be in Jan 2-5?  Thank you!

The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the 
DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and 
Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for 
trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 
22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official 
business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as 
long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.

Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 
22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for 
December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a

Enron Net Works has a 40 minute slot at the Management Conference.   I have 
roughly sketched out the following agenda:

Net Works Businesses  -  20 minutes (Greg/Louise)
The Fund - 10 minutes (Jeff McMahon)
Video - 10 minutes 

As a base for the presentation, please could you review (of course please 
write complete new ones if you want to) the slides incorporated in the 
presentation attached below (which was the last board presentation done by 
Greg) and send all updates to Jason by the end of play today.

Thanks

Louise

ps Please don't forget the slides for the budget too  which I would like 
tomorrow.

Got your most recent message.  Your observation is correct that the Enron 
Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with 
Doorstep reviews or planning.  Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some 
time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.  She did not start with 
the company until after Thanksgiving.  Since she started a couple of weeks 
ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the 
most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some 
solutions to issues that were raised.  There simply has not been the time to 
date to expose her to Doorstep.  

After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the 
roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.  Before we 
move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, 
methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project.  

I understand from Shona that you and she have discussed the plans for 
Doorstep Reviews in 2001.  I am asking via this note for my assistant to set 
up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline, 
methodology, and the involvement of RAC, Andersen, operations and your team.  
I will be on vacation the week of December 18.  I will be working the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, so if you are in the office we can plan on 
getting together that week.

I will be out of the office on vacation during the week of December 18.  
Please refer to the contact names below as needed during that week.  I can be

I will be back in the office on Wednesday, December 27 through Friday, 
December 29.  I will also be in for part of the day on Tuesday, December 26.  
Although that is an Enron holiday, there will be appropriate logistics 
personnel and book administrators in the office to support trading activities 
that day.       

Patti will send you on Monday a draft of a memo regarding publishing the DPR 
during the holidays.  Please review it and make sure that the commitments we 
are making can be met by London.  Let me know if anything needs to be changed 
or if there is further clarification needed in the notes, keeping in mind 
that with the audience on the memo that I want it to be short and easy.  Your 
comments/suggestions are welcomed and needed before I send this out later 
next week.  Thanks. --sally 

Great to hear from you.  I was thinking about you today.  I will look forward 
to your starting on the 29th.  Certainly if anything comes up with the move 
or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.  I will be glad to 
have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working 
together.  

I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus 
Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.  I do feel 
as if I have been the PRC queen recently.  Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on 
Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday 
of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the 
Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  

I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on 
December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys 
will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for 
full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those 
days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.  

Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday.  --Sally

Hi there  -- As I recall you are off next week, so wanted to touch base.  I 
am sure you will be ready  -- after PRC's and the craziness that has been 
going on over there.  

Just wanted to confirm my availability   and maybe see if we should get 
together while I am in Houston  (will be there between Christmas and New 
Year's) and could come in for a few hours or meet you for lunch.  

I think you said that you will be in London in early January - is that still 
happening?  Alternatively we could get together then.

Also -- I am planning to be ready to start work with you on Jan 29th  
(hopefully I can get Lauren into her school the week before - so she can get 
used to it).   We are leaving London on the 20th (AA signs of on our year end 
earnings release on Friday the 19th)  and then I will have a week to sort 
things out at home before starting!

I am really looking forward to learning something new, and working with you.  
Thanks for the opportunity.

If we don't speak before the holidays, I hope your family has a wonderful 
Christmas. 

Beth

The Analyst/Associates Program plans to send the PRC reps a final listing of 
the PRC results by Tuesday, December 19th.  They asked that we not 
communicate results until after that date.  I did not write down all results 
from the meeting, so I would be glad to let you know, but would prefer to 
wait until I have written documentation of final results in front of me 
before doing so.  Both Remi and Don Black were able to add to my discussion 
around Erwin, so he was well respresented in the process.  I am scheduled to 
be out on vacation next week, but I will check e:mail messages from home and 
will get back with you via e:mail next week to let you know final results.   
Hope that you enjoy the holidays.  I will be back at work right after 
Christmas.  -Sally 

I'm curious to know how did he do on Wednesday.  Any news?
Thanks.

FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find 
this note interesting.  Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several 
schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that 
lure students to join them.    Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of 
time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.  See note from Lexi 
below.  

Dear OU Team:

I just received notice from Jon Beck that he is declining our offer.  He has 
accepted with E&Y in Dallas.  They have offered to pay for his Master's of 
Accounting at the University of Virginia BEFORE he begins working for them.  
This is truly a wonderful opportunity for him, but I know how disappointed 
many of us are to see that he will not be joining the Enron team.

I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00 
today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so 
we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting 
started.  I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office 
dedication, so I did not call!  Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday.  
My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the 
week between Christmas and New Years.  I wouldn't recommend taking your time 
during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do 
want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.  Wish I 
could send you with a shopping list for me!! 

Thanks for the heads up.  I will be here all day tomorrow.  --Sally

It is possible we will have a few late manual wires tomorrow.  SAP is 
shutting down early for a production build, and if we do not have all GBP or 
EUR payments confirmed by 4pm, we will have to create manual wires to make 
timely payments.  Thanks for your help.

I went by the store on my way home and saw a Pillsbury mix with red and green 
confetti in it - decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies.  Since 
it was after 10:00 when I got started on this project, it turned out be a 
good decision.  I would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for 
the family next week that I can use it.  

Did you get your cookies made?

Cindy

 

I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not 
even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is 
to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to 
busts.  

I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.

Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great 
to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different 
commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the 
interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your 
efforts.  --Sally 

Mike Jordan

Will try to call tomorrow for another slot to catch up

Hope all is well

I left Mike a message telling him that I was forwarding this to you and that 
someone on your team would verify this information and get  back to him.  His 
note asks for info back by Friday the 17th - Friday is the 15th and I assume 
that is the deadline that he intends.  Thanks.  --Sally

We need to prepare the Proof of Claim in the Perry Gas Companies, Inc. 
bankruptcy.     The debtor's  Schedule F filed  29-Sep-2000, with balances as 
of the bankruptcy filing date of 28-Aug-2000,  indicated the amount of our 
claims:

Creditor

Enron Energy Services                                            $5,387,076.11
I need by the close of business Friday, December 17th:

1. Please have the amounts verified by your respective area (ENA/EES).      
The accuracy of these figures is quite important.
2. Copies of all the legal documentation for your transaction(s).  We will 
need to file this with the court as an attachment

Please call if you have any questions.

We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many "New 
Counterparty" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to 
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty 
at all from the spreadsheet.  It will be done as quickly as possible.

Thanks

I meant to blind copy you on this.  Here it is...

Thanks for taking the time to send your note.  I am glad that the party was 
such a success and that Heather was able to contribute to that.  Heather is 
absolutely a wonderful asset to our team and to the company.  Thanks for your 
acknowledgement of that.  --Sally 

   

Sally,

I wanted to send you a short note to tell you about the success of last 
nights Office of the Chairman Holiday Assistant's Party.

The party was an absolute success, but one of the main reasons why was 
because of Heather Choate.  I sent out ONE email to Patti and she recruited 
Heather who made huge efforts to get some wonderful gifts to be given out. 

It is nice to see people truly going above and beyond!  She was a superstar!

Please use my office for the interviews on November 4th.  My office is 
EB3389.  If you need additional offices, you could contact several of my 
direct reports who have offices:  Brent Price, Brenda Herod, Bob Hall, Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner.  --Sally  

   
	
	

I am a recruiting co-ordinator with the Associate and Analyst Programs.  We 
are looking for additional offices within which to conduct interviews this 
Saturday, November 4th.  We are bringing in over 80 candidates and are in 
need of interview rooms.  Many of Enron's Executives and VPs recognize the 
importance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for 
these interviews.  However, many more offices are needed.  The interview 
process begins at approximately 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 1:00 p.m. that 
Saturday.  If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the 
materials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential 
documents to one side of your desk and/or credenza.  We will see that the 
materials are turned "face down" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as 
not to disturb their original state.  Unlike previous years, the Enron 
interviewers will be in the designated offices at all times with the 
candidates.   All offices will be locked after the completed interview 
process.  Please let me know the availability of your office for interviews 
at your earliest convenience.    We encourage your participation and 
appreciate your support.  

Yes, you are nuts!  I can't believe that you already have so many gingerbread 
houses made.  The cookie exchange was fun - fudge is definitely the easy 
route on that one.  

I will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow.  
-Sally 

Hey--how was your weekend--fudge delivered?

Got my bake sale item done--an 18 layer cookie tower.  Have 9 houses baked
with 3 to go.

Now to show that I really have gone nuts--I thought I would cook breakfast
for the 2nd grade at school on Friday morning....can I have your breakfast
pizza recipe?  We all thought it was great and I think the kids will think
it is fun....

Thanks!

speak to someone in her office (I thought it was her assistant) and Bobbie 
Power a week or two ago to let them know that Sally would not be available on 
this date.  Sally does, however, want to be a part of this group, so please

Email reminder on behalf of Cynthia Barrow:

By now you have received the packet for the WorkLife Executive Council 
Meeting scheduled for Monday, October 30, 2000.  The meeting will begin at 
2:00 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. in EB 42C1.  We appreciate your interest in the 
WorkLife Initiatives, we will be presenting to you.  Your input, comments and 
suggestions will be welcomed.  

We do regret that we were unable to schedule this meeting in a morning 
session for those outside of the Houston office and other requests that were 
suggested.  However, please be assured that every effort will be made for 
future meetings to be conducted in a morning session.

Look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San 
Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling 
on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that 
week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to 
know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that 
you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look 
forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.  

We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.  

Have a great weekend.  --Sally 

Beth Apollo
10/24/2000 09:27 AM
Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.

I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.

Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.

What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Beth

I will interviewing on campus for the Analyst Program on Monday and Tuesday, 
October 30 and 31.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have 
telephone numbers where I can be reached.  I will have my cell phone with me 
(713-417-1591) and I will check messages as we have breaks in the interview 
schedule during the day.   I will be back in the office on Wednesday, 
November 1.  

In my absence, please contact the following persons regarding trading 
operations issues:

Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306
    Bob Hall  x36956
    Leslie Reeves x37962

Power Operations Stacey White x31870
    Leslie Reeves x37962

DPR    Shona Wilson x39123
    
MPR    David Maxwell x36983

I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.  

   
	
	

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

Zhiyong

Thanks for your note.  I was great to meet you - I am glad that you could 
take the time out of the office to make the trip to Houston.  I will look 
forward to seeing you when I am next in London.  --Sally

I would just like to thank you both  for an extremely informative and 
constructive event. I learnt an lot from this and look forward to taking 
these ideas forward.

Mike

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
have heard anything on this.  

You got the right one -- thanks for telling me, but I already knew that 
without your having to tell me.  I cherish having sisters and love you very 
much too.  (Okay, maybe one of you is more cherished than the other, but 
don't tell Cara I said that!)  

If I haven't told you recently I am very glad you are my sister.  I love
you.

 Cindy (hoping this one goes to the right Sally!)

Cary, thanks for the response.  We will keep your name on the list and will 
contact you for any spring events.  --Sally 

I would like to remain on the team, but this fall is very difficult due to 
setting up a new business.  Please let me know if
there is anything else I can do to help.

Thanks

Cary

Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?  As you are 
probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so 
we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the 
analyst program.  Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.  We will be on 
campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).  Let me 
know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you 
formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU. 

Hope that all is going well in Chicago.  --Sally 

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

We can't wait to see the three of you.  Tammy and Tyler will be at home on 
Wednesday afternoon and will be expecting you whenever they see you.  Meagan 
has drill team practice after school until 4:45 and she drives herself home 
and Amanda rides the bus home after school, arriving about 4:30.  

Mo will be in Houston while you are here.  If it still works with your plans, 
I thought that I would take the day off on Friday, November 3 so that you, 
Paul, David and I could do something fun with Rebecca and Tyler.  The 
football game is that evening at 7:00.  I had also thought about arranging a 
lunch on Thursday (downtown - Irma's?) either for us with Mo, or even to 
expand that to include a bunch of ex-First City folks.  Mark Wilson, James 
Scribner, Chuch Randall and Charles Delacey all work here for Enron.  We 
could call MG Shetty, and with you and Mo and me, it would be quite a 
reunion.  Let me know if you would like to do either one of these two things 
and I will arrange whatever sounds good to you.  

Our phone numbers are: Home  281-370-8568
     Sally's Office   713-853-5926

Hi Sally,

This is a note to confirm that we are still on our way.  We'll be at Lora
and Doug Bonser's house in Austin from Oct 27 to Nov 1.  Their number in
Austin is 512-892-0418.  We are planning on leaving early Wednesday morning
and driving via Brenham.  Will Tammy and Tyler be home in the afternoon?  If
not, we could hang out with my friends from Montana until people will be at
your house -- Pam and Rob Stephens -- bought a house about 1 mile from you.
(They lived in Texas last time we were there, moved back to Montana, and I
just found out that they are back in Texas for the long term -- small
world.)

I have directions that I got from the web to your house -- once I get in the
general area, I can find it.

See you soon!
Stephanie

Very belated reply - I am cleaning up old e:mails today, and came across this 
one that I had not answered.  Commercial does not sign confirmations at this 
point.  Too many to make that practical these days.  When I started the 
confirm desk in 1994, traders were signing confirms at that time. Once they 
knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they 
were right, they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me.  In the 
early days of power, the traders once again were signing confirms.  Obviously 
interested in the details of every deal that was done.  But as the business 
grew, that too changed.  --Sally

Quick question - your confirms - are they signed by both Commercial & Comm 
Supp (as Attorney at Fact) - or by just one or the other?

I want to make sure EBS is consistent.

Currently - one of either Jim F or Paul R are signing all of them - rightly 
so at the moement - not many deals and they want to see all.

Thoughts?

B.

Thanks for the note.  I remembered that you will be coming in from London.  
Hope the trip is uneventful.  Sunday evening will not be lengthy, as I am 
sure that you will be tired. 

   
	
	

Sally,
My flight is scheduled to arrived in Houston on Sunday at 4:15 pm so I would 
expect to be a little late.

I would like to formulate the breakout groups prior to the forum.  I would 
like your input on likely persons to put together in these breakout 
sessions.  Let's talk tomorrow.  

I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember), 
the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs 
for Energy Operations in ENA.   Frank is working on a contract basis at this 
time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in 
order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the 
feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.  I have given Sheila my 
feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank 
than I have had.  Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or 
voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with 
Frank.  Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.   Thanks for taking the 
time to do this. 

Thanks.  I have shared these with Jeff Gossett (gas risk lead) and Scott 
Earnest (products risk lead).  I will be curious to hear about the plan that 
your DBA's have devised today.  Thanks for you help and attention to these 
problems.  

See names below for your IT contacts tonight - one on 32 and one on 31.  Do 
you know these folks?  They should be visibly on your floors.  Let me know if 
that doesn't happen.  --Sally

I need to give Sally Beck a name(s) for the extended cover tonight.

Could I have this name before our meeting at 5pm please?

FYI - handled 

I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday.  My dad is 
experiecing serious health problems, and he will be in Houston on Friday for 
an appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be going to 
the doctor's appointment with my dad.  Depending upon waiting room time, I 
may not be in the office for the 1:30 meeting in EB3305 to discuss the 
findings from the recent internal audit projects.  I have asked Shona Wilson 
to attend in my place.  Please continue with the meeting, as I know that this 
is a difficult meeting to schedule.  I will get an update from Shona when I 
get back to the office.

Attached - still not quite final - waiting for confirmation from Tom Gros and

Thanks. 

I also sent this version to Mike Jordan, Fernley Dyson and Shona for their 
input.  

Can you e:mail a copy to Tom Hopwood?  Thanks.

Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum that I am hosting next week.  There will be approximately 30 Enron 
business controllers present at the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid 
and back office operations for the following Enron entities:  Enron North 
America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron Global Markets, Enron 
Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron Energy Services.  
Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New 
York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  

You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Tuesday, October 24, 2000
Time:  8:30 am
  (breakfast will be served at 8:00 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

The group would like to hear about Enron's performance, your outlook for the 
remainder of 2000 and into 2001, your viewpoint on the future of the company 
and next growth opportunities, etc.  With a small group, your talk can be 
informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do 
so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce 
the value of this conference for this group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
Enron (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to "raise 
the flag" on issues if needed

 On the 12/11 MPR to be issued on 12/12, we will be taking a $56 million loss 
on Catalytica Energy Systems.  This asset will begin trading on the open 
market either Friday, 12/15 or Monday, 12/18 under the ticker CESIV.  The 
potential trading range of $10 - $20 per share is disclosed in the company's 
S-1.  This asset is in Raptor I and therefore this write-down will exhaust 
$56 M of the remaining Raptor I capacity.

 Please call me at x3-6983 with questions.

remainder of 2000 and into 2001, your viewpoint on the future of the company 
and next growth opportunities, etc.  With a small group, your talk can be 
informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do 
so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce 
the value of this conference for this group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
Enron (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to "raise 
the flag" on issues if needed 

        

As promised, although a little later than expected, a draft agenda is 
attached at the end of my memo to Mike.  The memo will walk you through the 
agenda.  Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  Again, 
I an sorry that you will not be able to join us, but I am pleased that so 
many others from the London office will be in attendance.  --Sally 

Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were 
confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the 
speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those 
speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, 
drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have 
arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy 
chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a 
means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This 
can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  

The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement 
of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short 
"state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and 
EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, 
discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  

Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in 
which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of 
operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could 
have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the 
afternoon.  

Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move 
Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and 
lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going 
project.  

Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool 
for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  

We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its 
impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted 
Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  

Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles 
Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are 
waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  

Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal 
presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will 
be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action 
steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information 
provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office 
services within Enron.  

Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to 
reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against 
our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  

Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still 
in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's 
attendance.  

FYI - would love to have your comments or suggestions

FYI re: schedule 

I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday, October 20.  My 
dad is experiencing serious health problems, and he is coming to Houston for 
a doctor's appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.  I will be 
going with him to the appointment.  I will have my cell phone with me 
(713-417-1591) and I will check messages throughout the day.   

In my absence, please contact the following persons on Friday regarding 
trading operations issues:

Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306

What is the latest on this one?  I gather that they are still using 
spreadsheets, which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem.  Are their 
positions not being captured and aggregated?  What does Scott Mills have to 
say about this?  --Sally 

	
	                           
	

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning "Proper Risk System".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of Enron 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was Enron NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a "controlled spreadsheet environment" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.
Ted

   

I believe they have implemented a secure spreadsheet environment in which to 
work.  I know I discussed this during a meeting with Ted and Donna a few 
months ago and we decided we could live with the change to a secure 
environment in lieu of a full EnPower implementation.  Although EnPower would 
be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the 
transaction volume there is not much we can do.  

As I understand it, there are further issues with capturing the appropriate 
curve shift info from these offices in RiskTrac.  Let's discuss what we can 
do and what decisions need to be made.

Thanks

Shona

Since this was a fix to a Doorstep finding, how do we react?
	
	

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

I discussed this with John Lavorato who is now responsible for this.  He said 
don't do anything!  When their  volumes increase we can address the Enpower 
implementation again.

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,

I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin 
on Wednesday, October 25.  That date does not work for me now.  I need to 
attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just 
set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under 
Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within 
ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team 
for their team building next Wednesday.  

Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next 
week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another 
night that week.  --Sally 

Thanks for the names and numbers.  I have just called and talked with 
Jonathan Beck and Jenia Nikolova; have left voice mail messages of 
congratulations for Jeremy Fitzpatrick, Matthew Olney, David Scott, Corrinn 
Sutton, and Thomas Underwood; and left a message with a roommate for Ryan 
White.  I did not get an answer of any kind when I tried Thomas Lowell's 
number.  He is the only one that I have not contacted at this point.  I will 
try his number again before I leave tonight.  --Sally

28/11/2000 13:42
As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James

Falik, Brian Kanatzar, Bryan Willingham, Carol Stauch, Castlen Moore, Doug 
Epperson, Chris Calato, Daniel Bates, Daniel Jenkins, David Eastlake, David

I have personally called each of the 38 candidates to let them know they have 
been selected.  They will also receive a formal letter through the mail later 
this week.  This letter will include details regarding November 4.

The interviews for the Tax Analyst position also yielded the following:
5 Spring Internship offers:  Ashley Berger, Yi (Zoe) Zhou, Li Li, Weijing 
Shin, and Xuemei Lang
1 Summer Internship offer: Chia-Lin Lee
2 Full Time Office Visits: Andrew Susman and Amanda Ostrander

The next step is cultivation.  I will assign candidates to targeted team 
members for telephone follow-up calls.  I would also like to have volunteers 
to go to Austin next week to take these candidates to dinner.  Please let me 
know if and when you will be available so that I can begin planning.

Thanks again for all your help and hard work!!!

Irfan was one of the UT students, not OU.  Just wanted to make sure that we 
have him on the right list.  

   

Sally:
Thank you for forwarding this information to me.  I instructed the candidates 
on campus that we would be in touch with them within 2 weeks.  Actually, for 
OU students, I will be calling them personally tomorrow to let them know 
their status.  Their invitation letters will be sent shortly thereafter.

Thanks!

As of Friday, October 13, it seems that this student had not heard back from 
Enron.  What is the timeline for getting back to students regarding Super 
Saturday?  
Irfiman@aol.com on 10/13/2000 01:15:38 AM
Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Irfan Iqbal

The 13th won't work for me, unfortunately.  Rick Causey is hosting an offsite 
meeting from Tuesday evening (Sept. 12) through Friday (Sept. 15).  If you 
were to arrive early enough on Tuesday, we could try to do the review before 
I catch the plane on Tuesday afternoon.  The only problem with that is that 
the VP/MD PRC is scheduled for September 11 and 12.  I don't know that the VP 
portion of the PRC will be completed on Monday, or that the results would be 
available to me on Tuesday even if the process is completed on Monday.  We 
have been asked to hold VP reviews until after the PRC process is completed.  

I will contact you as soon as I do have the results from the PRC and we will 
set up a specific time for the review, either in Houston or Calgary.  Seems 
like it would be a good time of year for me to head north!  --Sally

Will you have time to complete my performance review while I am in Houston 
next week?  I will be in the office on the afternoon of September 13th and 
would like to set aside some time on my calendar if you are available.  Can 
you let me know what time works best for you?  Another option would be to 
schedule some time after the VAR class training which goes until 5:00 pm on 
Thursday and Friday.  Please let me know your preference.
Thanks
Peggy

The Associates PRC was completed on Monday, July 24.  As the PRC rep, I will 
communicate the final ranking from the PRC process to your supervisor.  I 
received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on 
vacation.  I will be communicating the final rankings to each Associate's 
supervisor today.  It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your 
performance review and the ranking.  In your case, I would guess that Jean 
and your new supervisor will have to work out which one (or both) will do 
your review.  --Sally   

Sally,

I don't know whether you or Jean (or Paul?) should be doing the feedback 
meeting.  If you will be doing it, please respond with your earliest 
availability to conduct that meeting.  I am fairly open currently except for 
3pm-4pm Mon-Thurs.  

Thanks,

The Associates PRC meeting has been rescheduled for Monday, July 24th at 9:00 
am.  I have also sent an e:mail message to the associates letting them know 
about the new date.  

We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.  I will contact 
your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results.  
Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to 
summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review.  

Thanks for providing your resumes.  I will feel more informed during the 
process.   

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
Houston.  My extension is 35926. 

Count on me for interviews at OU on Monday, October 30.  If possible, I would 
love to fly up on Monday morning, preserving my Sunday night at home.  The 
first flight from IAH to OKC arrives in OKC at 8:10 am.  I could easily be in 
Norman for a 9:00 am interview.  I can also stay for interviews on October 
31, with a target of catching a flight from OKC at 1:35 pm back to IAH (the 
next flight after that for leaves OKC at 4:36 and arrives at IAH at 5:56, 
putting me at my house around 7:00 - too late for the start of trick or 
treating with a 2 year old).  

I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody 
Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year.  I 
would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU 
this last time.  

I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago 
office.  I will let you know what I hear back from him.  Consider Shona 
Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 & 
31.  
Finally, I have noted November 10 on my calendar for the management 
overview.  Keep me posted on details.  --Sally 

   

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

Today's Enron-wide Associates PRC meeting has been cancelled.  It was 
scheduled to start at 1:30 today, following the Analysts PRC.  Apparently, 
the Analysts PRC is running long.  Since both meetings were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as the chair, the Associates PRC has been 
cancelled.  I do not yet have a rescheduled date.  I will let you know when I 
do.  I am also sending an e:mail message to the Associates that I am 
representing so that they will informed of the cancellation.  

Thanks for taking the time to meet or talk with me about the performance of 
your respective associate in preparation for the PRC.  

Thanks for the note.  I had received a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor =
?Evaluation Form.  Today I also met with Jim and he provided me with his ?b=

 ?of accomplishments for the period.  If there is anything else that you th=

I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will 
take place on July 19.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates to 
represent in the meeting as indicated on the attachment.  The Associates 
Program has provided me  with your name as the PRC supervisor of the 
associate as listed.  

 

Please provide me with the following by Friday, July 14:   

Associate's accomplishments for the first half of 2000 (prepared by the 
associate or summarized by you) 

Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any 
additional rotational assignments during this first six months of the year) 

Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion 
on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, 
Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues) 

Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately 
representing the associate in the PRC process

Recommendation for promotion, if any 

I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP 
system through the Associates Program.  

I will be on vacation until Monday, July 17.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, 
will be contacting you next week to ask if you would like to meet with me for 
a few minutes on Monday or Tuesday, July 17 and 18 (or phone call) to discuss 
your associate and his/her performance in more detail.  

Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC 
supervisor for the associate listed on the attachment,  please reply by 
e:mail as soon as possible and my assistant will research where I should go 
next for this input.  

I don't think that John Jacobsen should be reviewed in London.  Pulp & paper 
is still an ENA group, even though we have John reporting to you.  I would 
not roll that up under Global Products as it exists today.  We did review him 
in our PRC.  For some reason, HR has confused the issue with the Pulp & Paper 
employees by putting them under Global Products rather than ENA, a step they 
took I believe without any outside direction.  Does this make sense to you?  
--Sally 

   
	
	

I need a one page summary for all of your employees before I leave for London 
on Monday, July 10th.  I need this summary and all customer feedback 
delivered to Sue as soon as possible for aggregation.

These are the items I need:

Employee Name

Title

Brief Job Description and Day to Day Responsibilities

Areas of Strengths with Specific Examples

Areas of Improvement with Detailed Strategy and Direction for necessary 
improvement

Accomplishments / Process Improvements Employee made, did, or was part of

What this employee Did / Did not do in the first six months that made your 
life Easier / Harder (Met / Exceeded / Did Not Exceed Expectations)

What you need from each employee in order to help you move your group forward

I really think this should be no greater than one page.  While I am familiar 
with most if not all of these employees, I DO NOT know all of the above 
criteria for everyone.  These are the types of issues I anticipate being 
raised at the larger PRC and I need to make sure that I can answer any 
question raised.

I will sit down with each one of you and discuss each employee page 
individually after the PRC.  I would like to use this page as the PRIMARY 
feedback form for us to deliver to each employee.  This should supplement the 
system feedback form that we have used in the past.  At that time, I plan to 
roll out a group strategy and what is going to be expected from you and your 
groups in order for all of us to accomplish the known goals and objectives of 
our business.  I anticipate having these meetings completed by the end of 
July with feedback beginning around August 1st and finished by August 31st.  
This will give us plenty of time to plan around any issues that arise, 
however I would encourage you to get the feedback completed as soon as 
possible.

Last but by no means least, I would like to thank each and everyone of you 
for all of your hardwork and dedication to our business.  We have had many 
achievements and accomplishments and have taken on many new challenges and 
opportunities.  This is a direct compliment to you and I wanted to say THANK 
YOU!

Have a GREAT Holiday Weekend!

I hope that your holiday was wonderful.  Nikki told me that you would be 
working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.  I will try 
to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I 
start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 
to about 7:15. 

I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't 
think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of 
June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled 
dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the 
trip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  

Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG 
acquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about 
resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence 
efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe 
that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a 
controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they 
run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how 
best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, 
as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already 
been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and 
in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who 
seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the 
names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is 
unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can 
hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    

Sorry this took so long...  Sally says put her on our Co #413, RC # 0813 for 
now.  Also, she would like Angelique's resume as soon as possible.  Sally is 
in Calgary but she asked me to fax it to her as soon as I get it, so tomorrow 
would be great.

Thanks for your help,

For the May 8th expanded staff meeting, I would like to include Kevin Heal 
(Lead, Logistics) and Dianne Seib (Sr. Specialist, Documentation) as well as 
Kathy Reeves who is currently my only direct report at the manager level.  
Kevin and Dianne provide a lot of leadership to their respective groups, and 
I think it would be very useful for them to hear what Beth has to say.  Do 
you think this will cause a problem given that you are restricting the 
Houston attendance?  Let me know your thoughts.

For the PRC meeting, I am currently planning to be in Houston June 15th and 
16th for the Global conference.  The best dates for me would be Tuesday, June 
13th or  Wednesday, June 14th, and I'll just come to Houston earlier than 
planned.  Let me know once you've finalized the date.

For the training, there are only three people in Energy Operations doing 
reviews.  The three are Kevin Heal, Kathy Reeves and me.  I don't know 
Norma's last name so would you mind forwarding this list to her.  I will talk 
to Dawn Doucet about the best way to coordinate the training.

Let me know if you have questions.

Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.  Got 
your message last Friday.  It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested 
in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim 
Fallon.  The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.  May be 
the end of this week, may be next week.  I think it will still be good for 
you and Kristin to talk in person.  Kristin and Todd are both very qualified 
and you would love working with both.  Kristin's established working 
relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.  I don't want to 
lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same
 time.  So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  

I got your message on housing/location in Houston.  I am headed out of the 
office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.  I 
will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some 
options on housing.  

Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?  As you are 
probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so 
we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the 
analyst program.  Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.  We will be on 
campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).  Let me 
know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you 
formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU. 

Hope that all is going well in Chicago.  --Sally

We did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support.  I 
have also discussed this at length with Brent, and agree that the shift of 
manager positions to front to back looks across each region (eliminating the 
OA and Deal Validation manager roles) makes sense.  Upon the recommendation 
of Susan and Brent, I am comfortable with appointing Jeff Gossett as the 
manager of the West region.   

Kim Melodick
04/17/2000 10:46 AM
Susan indicated that she had a conversation with you about these promotions. 
Are you comfortable going forward with them?
Susan Harrison
04/14/2000 03:49 PM
We are in the process of reorganizing several functional groups within Gas 
Operations.  With this change, we want to promote Jeff Gossett to Manager 
effective May 1.  The following describes the reorganization and 
justification for the promotion.

The Risk Management, Operational Analysis, Transport Rates and Deal 
Validation groups will be realigned into four regional teams and managed by 
Business Controllers.  There will also be a centralized Controls group with 
2-3 individuals that will be managed by a different Business Controller.  
With this realignment, we are creating five new manager positions (four 
regional and one Controls) and eliminating the two manager positions for the 
Deal Validation and the Operational Analysis/Transport Rates groups.  The 
regional Business Controllers will be responsible for managing the day-to-day 
activities of their regional teams, including interacting with the Trading 
Desk Directors, and the Controls manager will work across the regional teams 
to ensure consistency and efficiency in our processes.

The new Controller positions will be filled as follows:

West - Jeff Gossett 
Central - Carrie Hollomon
East - Will Kelly (Senior Specialist)
Controls - Kathryn Cordes
Texas - TBD (Brenda Herod to hire)

We are promoting Jeff Gossett at this time due to the responsibilities he 
will be carrying in the Controller role in addition to his current 
responsibilities for the NGP&L and Benchmark functions.   

Will Kelly's performance will be evaluated during the next few months to 
determine if he will be the permanent Controller for the East region.  If he 
performs well in this role, mid-year promotion will be pursued.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will follow-up next week to 
discuss a salary adjustment for Jeff Gossett.

Thanks,

Susan  

Approved.

Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate.  For a woman who can't remember the 
last time that she cooked dinner, this will come in very handy!  Thanks, too, 
for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two 
days.  I will take that home with me tonight and I will enjoy it during my 
upcoming days off.  

I hope that the Christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season -- 
and some rest, relaxation and time with family and friends.  Thanks for your 
enthusiasm in your role at Enron and for your continuing and tireless 
effort.  It is through working with each one of you that I find my job to be 
fun.  1999 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Energy Operations - 
a direct result of your contributions.  I look forward to meeting new 
challenges in 2000 through continuing to work together.      

As of Friday, October 13, it seems that this student had not heard back from 
Enron.  What is the timeline for getting back to students regarding Super 
Saturday?

Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Sally,

Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.

Also per your request, attached are the five "non-standard" deals for which 
we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

Colorado Springs Utilities  10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWs
BPA     10/1/01-12/31/05 NW Delivered 105 MWs

Glad you could make it yesterday.  I don't play (at least not in front of 
others), so I do look for golfers from time to time.  I will keep your number 
handy!  

   

Sally, I really appreciate being able to play on your behalf in the 
tournament yesterday.  It was a very nice course and we had a great time.  
It's always nice to interact with your peers outside of work.  If you ever 
need an extra player again ... my clubs are in the car.

Thanks again.

Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got 
at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed 
ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 
today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me 
earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could 
have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail 
is much better.  

I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews 
must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff 
meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rate 
of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished 
reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three 
last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three 
reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver 
tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the 
office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late 
afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be 
MUCH better.  

I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love 
to have to over here and involved in operations.  So I will either catch you 
from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday.  

Did you get to check on lunch plans for Thursday or Friday next week with 
directs?  This looks like it could conflict.

If HR can not find this signed review, can Clara communicate with someone in 
your group in Houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 11:00 am 
on Friday?  That is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews 
(defined strictly by HR as their having received - and retained, I guess - 
the signed review).  The goal is 100% completion by then, for reporting in 
the ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting on Friday afternoon.  Although many 
employees are now not under the ENA umbrella, we are tracking the completion 
of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year PRC time.  
Thanks.  

Of course, I believe you said that this guy left the company, and if that is 
the case we may be alright without the review.  But getting a second copy 
from Clara would probably be the best bet.  Thanks. 

   
	
	

Hector, 
DeMarco Carter's mid-year was completed and turned in with the others, per 
Clara.

I you still can not find, Clara can make a copy for you next Tuesday when she 
returns from the London office.

I scheduled this meeting in Houston to best accomodate schedules of some of 
our Enron speakers -- the hill country or even Galveston was going to make it 
impossible for Jeff Skilling to join us.  I would look at this meeting as if 
it were to be held outside of town.  I have preliminarily reserved rooms for 
all of you at the Wyndham Warwick.  Part of the reason for this forum is to 
meet and get to know your counterparts in other Enron operating companies and 
from around the world.  If you can stay at the hotel, this team building will 
probably be enhanced.  This memo is not to force you to pack your bags and 
stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did 
include rooms for all of you for Sunday and Monday nights.  I hate the Sunday 
thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who 
will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules.  Please let 
Patti know on Thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to 
make it easier for you to fully participate.  

I am forwarding a message from a Wellesley student which includes her 
resume.  Let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return 
visit in November.  I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation, 
and was impressed with her.  She has followed up with phone calls and this 
e:mail.  I am sending her some additional information on Enron at her request 
to help familiarize her with the company.  Her work experience to date has 
been with more traditional energy companies. --Sally 
Dear Ms. Beck:

I am writing to thank you for taking your time to talk with me on the
phone this morning. I am very excited about this opprtunity to speak with
you again.

I understand that you must very busy now and I attach my resume to gain
more time to discuss how my background fits Enron's requirements and
business objectives.

I will call you at 4.30 pm today.

Thank you,

Sona

I was in Austin the end of last week recruiting at UT and (in a sense of 
open-mindedness and fair play) was at OU on Sunday night and Monday 
recruiting as well. James and I have not had a chance to talk following your 
conversations.  Nor am I really caught up on e:mail messages.  I have some 
tight deadlines on a couple of things for Friday, so it may be Monday before 
James and I have the opportunity to talk in any detail.  

Mike Campbell <MCampbell@HDINC.COM> on 10/10/2000 04:12:47 PM
Sally,
We had a good meeting with James last week - I hope you have had the
opportunity to talk with him about it. What are the next steps? Would you
like to get together and have a mini-planning session on developing the
business maturity model around your business opportunities? We got a chance
to talk with James a little on that front, but he is not sure where your
thinking is on some of these approaches. I believe that is the best way to
get the changes you are seeking and accomplish the other business objectives
at the same time. Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mike Campbell

I did find one that I have not used.  You will just need to change the 
information at the top of the page.  

Attached is your actual form.  I did not have a totally blank one to forward, 
as I have actually done work on all evals on my disk.  So I am sending yours 
so that you can erase your data and use this as a template.  Hope this works!

Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers. 
However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.  The remainder are 
senior specialists.  Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in 
detail.  We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these 
players away.  Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our 
competitor, which will require that he have good people.  He will be moving 
to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.  
He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or 
childless, their mobility factors could be high.  Enron would not want to 
lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.   

Todd, 
Let's work up a plan tomorrow for Jeff Gossett's managers before the 
completion of your survey.   If your schedule does not allow it please 
recommend someone in comp. who can help or please provide guidance for 
alternatives.    Thanks for your help.  
hgm
	
	

Hector:  The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, 
with the exception of Will Kelly.  If you remember, these are the risk 
employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter 
of resignation.  Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and 
it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join 
him and help ensure his success with his new employer.  We don't want this to 
happen.  Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective 
retention plan does not make sense.  Please call me tomorrow and let's talk 
about how we can jump start this.  Thanks.  --Sally 

Jeff, 
I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we 
talked about.   He told me that he would make a recommendation after he 
completes the pay practices survery by Mid-November in order to accurately 
compensate them.   He is concerned that we may present an inaccurate plan for 
retention without market data. 
If this is a very urgent issue for you please let us know.   If you suspect 
that the managers are being made offers then please let us know.

I am so glad that you will be able to attend.  I will have a fully developed 
draft agenda available within the next couple of days.  It may help to know 
that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the 
hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.  We hope to have Mark Frevert 
join us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be 
low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to 
Houston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so 
that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.  I 
do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings 
in the Houston office on Wednesday.  If that is the case, I will also arrange 
a dinner for Tuesday night.  Hope that this helps!

Good input on those leather pants.  I can just picture her shopping.  We will 
look forward to seeing you for lunch on Saturday.  The weather looks as if it 
should be good for the game that night.  See you soon!  

Hi, Sally--am sure you are glad to be back from cold, dark, cruel Oklahoma!

We will need to drive over early Saturday.  Brigeda has an art lesson at 4pm
on Fridays so we wouldn't be able to hit the road until pretty late.

Found out this morning she has pneumonia--has had a cough I decided I should
check out--although she is not contagious and is staying in school...

Brigeda went shopping with your Gap card this weekend--she thought it was
just too cool.  She is very conservative with money so she shopped the sale
racks.  I stayed out of the selection process totally--certainly a sign of
things to come!  She picked out two jean skirts and two shirts--no doubt she
will wear them to your house--I believe that she is trying to look/dress
like Amanda.  (I did, however, dissuade her from buying the leather
pants--told her that would be way too sweaty!)

Looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday.  We'll plan to hit the road
by 9.

It is with regret that I have accepted Steve Jackson's letter of resignation 
from Enron.  Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another 
company in the industry.  I know that you will join me in thanking him for 
his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made.  
His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as 
will his leadership on the gas team.  Although Steve's official last day with 
the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.  He will be 
available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you 
may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.  Patti has his 
home number if you need that.  We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and 
we will let you know when and where that will take place.  

Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk 
group, reporting to me.  Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as 
business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide 
leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all 
aspects of this key business for North America.  Please join me in 
congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities.   

FYI...I will keep you posted.  
	
	

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  

Attached is a memo that I have sent to Mike Jordan regarding the Operations 
Controller forum set for October 22, 23 and 24.  I want to send the official 
invitation early next week.  I have conferred with Mike on attendees from 
EEL.   Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I 
did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is 
finalized.  Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.  

Mike was not sure that you would want to be included, but I certainly want to 
invite you and would very much welcome your attendance.  If you can come, I 
would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so.  Just 
let me know.  Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford are 
confirmed as speakers, and I am waiting to hear from Mark Frevert on his 
participation.  I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next 
week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.  

Hope you have a great weekend.  --Sally

Good memo - let me know if you see results.  

   

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

Peggy, is the EOL bridge functionality working for you in Calgary?  Jeff 
Gossett was in a meeting with me on Monday this week discussing systems 
issues.  Beth Perlman mentioned that the EOL bridging had been completed, but 
Jeff spoke up and said that it was not working correctly.  You or someone on 
your team may want to call Jeff to understand the issues that he was having 
to be certain that you are happy with the functionality that you now have in 
Calgary.  Thanks.

Please update the following items for Project Doorstep:

Observation:  Term transactions executed via EOL do not automatically bridge 
into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of transactions manually 
captured.

Status: The bridge from EOL to Sitara for term transactions was placed into 
production on September 21st.  This item is now completed.

For your information, we are planning to complete our Enpower testing today 
and are working with Houston to go into production tomorrow.  I will let you 
know once this is done.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Peggy

4 counterparties for a total of $10.2MM makes me think that each one must be 
pretty large.  I am copying Leslie on this note, as I would like to know the 
names of the counterparties in the over 90 day bucket and how many dollars 
are associated with each one -- also how likely we think that collection is 
in each case.  

Leslie:  I know that it may be that reconciliation is not far enough along at 
this point to provide this kind of detail, but it is the type of question 
that Dave may ask.  

Lisa B Cousino
09/27/2000 02:19 PM
Sally - I checked into the number of counterparties that we included in the 
A/R balances that were being reconciled.  It is 4 as stated below.  Please 
let me know if you need anything else.  I did deliver copies of they July and 
August report to Tammie Shepherd.

Brian Heinrich

Actually, counting the monetized counterparty that we lumped in it would be 4 
counterparties.

Audrey Cook

The answer to your question regarding the number of counterparties in 
"reconciliation status" on the Delaney Report is 3.  Let me know if you have 
any further questions.  Thanks

Decisions, decisions ...they are tough for her.  I suppose that if she wants 
others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of 
packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake 
that we can!  (Do you think that we will be invited?)  That really sounds 
ugly, and I don't mean it to.  I think that your idea was a great one, but if 
she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests.  Let me 
know when the deliberation process is completed!  --Sally 

Sally,

Let's reserve that last weekend.  Saturday would be fine with me.  You need
to know that I got an email from Cara--she's had a couple of offers for
showers--and is having a hard time deciding what to do (hmm...what a
surprise!).  Anyway, am not sure where our offer stands--we'll see.  I told
her to do whatever is best for her (while thinking:  if she doesn't choose
our shower invitation it will affect my gift!)

Will try to pin her down...

Cindy

Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the
weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big
dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and
a winter party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a
row, January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work
well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for
you?  And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably
works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by
Sunday afternoon!!

Hi...

Talked to the little mother-to-be.  She said a shower would be grand.  She
has some big presentation mid-January.  How does late January sound to you.
Should we set a date now?  Am I turning into Mother?

Cindy

This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my 
office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on 
financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't  
clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at 
a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said 
that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff 
to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and 
settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There 
should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms 
and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks.

Thanks for sending the dates in writing.  We already have this on our home 
calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit.  I did confirm 
that there is a home football game on Friday, November 3, so if you all are 
interested in going, we will have plenty of tickets.  The weather should be 
great here then. 

I have also blocked off Friday, November 3 from work so that we can do 
something fun with the kids -- zoo, Children's Museum, etc. 

I sent Mo an e:mail message about your stay in Houston in hopes that she may 
need to be in Houston at that time.  I will let you know what I hear from 
her.  

Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,
Stephanie

Is this a timeline for all of ENA, or just for the accounting group? 
Darin Talley@ENRON
09/26/2000 02:37 PM
Please note that earnings and headcount templates are due to Consolidations 
on Monday, October 2nd.  Attached is the latest timeline.  Please submit your 
templates to Trey Hardy by then.  Several guidelines or allocation 
calculations (e.g., IT) have not been sent to you because we have not 
received them from Corp. or ENW.  Therefore, we recommend that you use the 
guidelines from 2000.  That should avoid any delays for Monday.

Please forward this to anyone who is participating in the Plan 2001 process.  
Call me if you have any questions (x58694).  Thank you.

Hope are things in London?  I have seen Beth Apollo at two meetings in Texas 
recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the 
Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.  

I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at 
the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students 
at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston 
from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.  They will be staying with 
us at our house.  It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one 
another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the 
way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here 
she will be about six months pregnant.  

I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off 
chance that you might be in Houston at that time.  It would be fun for all of 
us to get together.  I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has 
joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, 
who was on his first day here.  We could also schedule a First City reunion 
if you could be here.  If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the 
next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects 
for a lunch or happy hour.  

I may need to head to London in October or November.  I will let you know if 
my travel plans develop.  

I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain 
climbing!!!!!!!  How was it?  I will be anxious to hear.  --Sally  

I read your note back to Shona, and I understand John's desire to put a 
reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the 
need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in 
writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an 
efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define 
and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, 
then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the 
context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.  --Sally

Comments in red

   

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

Mike Jordan

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Mike

Thanks for following up on this.  

   
	
	

Sally - per our conversation I have attached the message Jeff sent out this 
morning.  We will follow up to ensure the source of incorrect cp names as 
well as timeliness in correcting those.  I am meeting with Debbie Brackett in 
credit on Wed. to review current process and procedures and make changes as 
needed.

Thanks,
Leslie

Please make sure that your groups are changing counterparty names as soon as 
they get the correction forms from confirmations.  With prices at these 
levels, it is vital that all information be correct in the system,  whether 
or not it has an impact on your p&l. 

Thanks

This is hilarious!  I am laughing outloud!!

?
Sisters.....this  one made me laugh out loud....more than  once....?

Ingredients:
1 cup of water
1 tsp baking soda
1 cup  of sugar
1 tsp salt
1 cup of brown sugar
lemon juice
4 large  eggs
nuts
1 bottle Vodka
2 cups of dried fruit

Sample the vodka  to check quality. Take a large bowl, check the vodka again.
To be sure it is  the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink.

Repeat.

Turn on  the electric mixer. Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl.
Add one  teaspoon of sugar. Beat again. At this point it's best to make sure 
the vodka is  still OK.

Try another cup .... just in case. Turn off the  mixerer.

Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried  fruit.

Pick fruit off floor.

Mix on the turner.

If the  fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers pry it loose with a  
sdrewscriver.

Sample the vodka to check for tonsisticity.

Next,  sift two cups of salt. Or something. Who giveshz a shit.

Check the  vodka.

Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts.

Add one  table.

Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can  find.

Greash the oven and piss in the fridge.

Turn the cake tin  360 degrees and try not to fall over.

Don't forget to beat off the  turner.

Finally, throw the bowl through the window, finish the vodka and  kick the 
cat.

Fall into bed.

CHERRY MISTMAS!

FYI 

Fernley:  I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.  In 
fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, 
we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.  The 
global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists 
for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all Enron offices 
worldwide, a "what time is it there if I am here" page, etc.  I would like 
for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out 
of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan 
widely at this point.  However, I thought that I would let you know so that 
we would not duplicate any efforts.

I think the note is fine. My concern would be access to details of the 
standards themselves. People will be less inclined to come to you and me, but 
they may well click on an intranet link to the policies and procedures 
website for example.

For your consideration.

Thanks

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Mike

FYI - yes, my response was lengthy! 

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I 
am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is 
there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a 
letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be 
sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead 
in to the article?  

With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally

Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the 
weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance 
that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter 
party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a row, 
January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work well (and 
I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for you?  And do 
you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably works better 
for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday 
afternoon!! 

Hi...

Talked to the little mother-to-be.  She said a shower would be grand.  She
has some big presentation mid-January.  How does late January sound to you.
Should we set a date now?  Am I turning into Mother?

Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that 
you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the 
other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, 
but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  

I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of 
crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th 
we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick 
friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of 
their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will 
be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to 
continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to 
Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at 
Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us 
from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin 
after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return 
to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A 
Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all 
of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for 
Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's 
birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, 
but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it 
to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  

I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for 
Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope 
that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two 
Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this 
year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 
grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for 
them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I 
wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly 
okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  

How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that 
he is doing better.  

I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly 
predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions 
for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will 
be very interested in the gosipy details.  

Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow 
night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 
27 packages of fudge.  

Got your message last night--sorry I missed you--must have been in the
shower.  We are all going nuts here, too.  We have a huge deadline here at
work.  But I worked most of last weekend so am ahead of the curve.  Good
thing, since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school events
this week and next.  LAst night was "lessons and carols" by the school
choir--with me decorating, baking, and coordinating.  Today I go to school
to make Christmas stockings with the kids--Sunday is the school Christmas
Bazaar at the Four Seasons--need to bring an item for the bake sale.  Also
need to start baking 12 gingerbread houses for Brigeda's class.    Did find
a matching mold to the smaller one we have so I can at least bake two at
once--twelve bakes is MUCH better than 24!  And then there is that dollhouse
that needs my attention by the 25!

I am totally ok with us not doing the shower.  We get credit for offering
but don't have to do anything.  Both money and time are in such short supply
for me that it works out for the best.  At work we start on a contract for
Dell in January.  The company is also going to pay for Java programming
classes for some of us (if I can nail this down then I can jump up to a
programmer level on that pay scale).  I also have a private contract job
with a needlepoint store in Memphis to setup their website.

Am somewhat concerned that Mother will have one of her dramas when Cara's
baby comes...you know she will get her feelings hurt somehow.  Not to
mention the fact that she will be sharing the grandchild with "the most
selfish woman on earth."  Richard and Brigeda went out to the Lowrimore farm
(they sold it and offered us all of the firewood).  Jane couldn't have been
sweeter to Brigeda--spent a lot of time with her.  Can just imagine that
"pained" look in Mother's face at the hospital.  If you are not here may
need you to carry your cell phone so I can call for moral support--or at
least give you gossipy updates on the drama....

Are you planning to come later this month when you are off?  I'm taking off
the 21st and 22nd--they have given all of the technical production staff the
days between Christmas and New Years as comp time so I will be off until the
2nd...

Cindy

Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between
work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much
to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and
punch!  Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I
noticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week -
really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have
been doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be
off the week of December 18th.

Geynille,

Sally will not be able to attend Sept. 27 Intern offer dinner, but will 
attend presentation dinner on Sept. 28.

Thanks, Geynille

Thanks for your list.  I have talked with Brent and of the three names that 
you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.  

I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they 
should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to 
accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are 
depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have 
active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day 
basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking 
to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their 
locations - weather, coal, etc.

I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting 
to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully 
decline!

Proposed list - of all potential candidates

Myself
James New - and his lead risk managers
Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration
Andrew Cornfield - Metals Risk Manager
Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

Mike

Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.  With the ages of the 
kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our 
home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that 
up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of 
Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second 
cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate 
party!) 

We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on 
that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the 
football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that we 
may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on the 
drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to 
Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the 
spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan. 

We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you 
have a list of what is available for those schools?  

Thanks for the nice words. I hope Enron will be able to look at some
students for summer internships, as I am sure they will be gone by Spring.

As far as Texas tickets go, I can come up with 5 singles, but not 5 together
or even 3 and 2. Let me know if interested and I will try to get them. Might
be able to trade up or something.

Let me know what other schools you are talking about and I can find out for
you.

Again, thank you for taking time out your schedule to come up and be a part
of the OU recruiting effort. It has been your support and efforts that we
have to thank for Enron coming to OU. Keep me posted on what you work out
with HR with regards to summer interns.

It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I
appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.
I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody
and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have
done a great job in changing and promoting the program.

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware
of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully
with a change in our strategy!

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets
may already be sold.

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know
-- we can probably place a few orders through you!

Invitations have been mailed to all VP's and above for the annual Enron 
Management Conference to be held at the Hyatt Hill Country in San Antonio 
November 15-17.  Hopefully, you have received your invitation (more to save 
the date than to provide any detail at this point).  If you have not received 
your invitation, please let me know.

Please put this on my calendar.  I don't know if I will make it there, but I 
would like for it to be on my calendar.  Thanks. 
Please join us at an all-employee meeting at 10 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 3, in the 
Hyatt Regency's Imperial Ballroom. We will review our financial and operating 
highlights and discuss in more detail the strategy behind Enron Net Works and 
our wholesale marketing efforts.  The meeting will be streamed live on IP-TV 
to employees in Houston, Omaha, Portland, New York, Calgary, Toronto, London, 
Stockholm, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.  For the first time, we will broadcast 
the meeting via video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Rio de 
Janeiro, Buenos Aires and San Juan.  

As always, we welcome your questions and will answer any questions submitted 
in advance.  Please send them to Mary Clark by e-mail, fax (713-853-6790) or 
interoffice mail (EB4704C).  The deadline for advance questions is Wed., 
Sept. 27.  Of course, we also welcome and will answer any questions raised at 
the meeting.

We look forward to seeing you there. 

Ken, Jeff and Joe

Yes, he is working on the short list.  I do have to say, however, that I have 
not had questions from him on any of those names.  I will leave him a voice 
mail message for an update.

Brent,

I have begun initial interviews this week. I started with Gas Trading 
Operations and will be moving on to Global Services next week (Shona Wilson, 
Mary Solmonson, James Scribner, Scott Mills and Sheri Thomas).  I hope to get 
to your group the week after next.  However, I will be calling next week to 
set up interviews with both you and your Directors.

Everything is progressing according to plan and I still expect  the analysis 
to be completed by mid November.

I hope this helps.  Please call me if you have any questions.  I can be 
reached at X39437.

I look forward to meeting you and your group.

Kind Regards,

I know that there are a number of things that do not work as we had 
anticipated in SAP.  I also know that there are several things where we have 
to change our processes to accomodate differences or gaps in SAP.  We also 
have significant issues with the timing of certain runs within SAP and a 
mismatch of that timing with our business processes.  There was a concerted 
effort kicked off by the SAP team last week to try and identify and resolve 
issues.  They met with my direct reports.  However, we have to reconvene as 
we ran out of time to cover all issues!  I have asked Leslie Reeves and Bryce 
to get back to me on even more detail on this example so that we can fully 
understand how much of this issue was attributable to human versus system.  I 
will get back with you as I know more details and as I can share with you our 
list of first "hits" for SAP fixes or enhancements.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  --Sally 

   
	
	

Sally,

Are you aware of the problems with SAP?  This error caused an incremental 
$600,000 credit loss to Perry Gas Companies that could have been prevented.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Bill

	
	                           
	

FYI-

	
	

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was 
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P 
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

   

	
	                           
	

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on 
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

Russell

I have read this series of e:mails but I am not sure that I fully understand 
the issue.  Did Willie not do his job?  Are there problems with how SAP 
works?  Are both of these an issue?  Please let me know if we have a far 
reaching problem with SAP and netting.  Thanks.  --Sally

As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of 
Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In 
conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily 
report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston 
time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet 
Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete 
as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over 
the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be 
excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are 
very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send 
to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  

I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh 
and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we 
tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in 
the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that 
Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  

Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R 
calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The 
Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing 
an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this 
timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by 
approximately 10:00 am Houston time.  

Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R 
including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) 
will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston 
time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component 
V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with 
you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support 
and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London 
requirement for officialized books.  

The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on 
what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread 
options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations 
that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the 
component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will 
currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less 
material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of 
days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of 
this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  

I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the 
UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.  
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is 
probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and 
systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report 
earlier in the morning.  

Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or 
not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently 
meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.    

I updated that systems matrix recently, in preparation for our much 
rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.  That is on my calendar for 
Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.  

I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.  To date, 
I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types 
of information and format that he likes.  I will bring you a copy tomorrow 
and would like your input on content and format as well.  With the recent 
reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report.  
After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan 
to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can 
use the same format.  

In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily 
report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track 
compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of 
determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency 
of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations 
against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I 
will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.

is this the latest?  Also, how are we coming on an operational position 
report?  I know it would be rough but I would like to start producing 
something sooner rather than later.  Thanks

Rick - You had asked a while back for a matrix that captures all of the 
different systems used by commodity, by office and by functional group.  This 
(draft) version encompasses Houston and London activities.  We will expand 
this document to include other offices and products in the next few months.  
Let me know your questions and comments.

Geynille,

Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday.  Sally is trying to juggle her 
calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on Sept. 28.  
Her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not 
dinner on the 27th.  Unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out 
on Thursday.  She was also wondering about details of dinner - said in the 
last meeting it had been discussed to possibly do a western theme - with 
jeans (?).  Is that still on?  If not, is dinner to be held at Stone Davis 
Hall?  Can I get the address of Stone Davis & address, phone, & fax for 
Wellesley Inn for Sally's itinerary.

Thanks,
Patti x39106

Please review the following attachments for details regarding the 
Presentation.  I have attached the Itinerary, along with details regarding 
the event.  We have changed the interview dates again.  The next possible 
dates to have the interviews are November 28th and 29th.  Anything after that 
would have been the last week of the semester in December or  in February.  I 
have attached the strategy also for your review.

Please don't hesitate to call me with questions.  I will be on the road and 
can be reached via my cell phone.
The number is 713-417-2236.

Diana,

Here's info you requested.  Per our conversation earlier, please try to 
arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for 
Sally & me both.  Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru.  
If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know 
what I mean.  Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that 
will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.  Please have 
person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.  She will be in 
training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is 
available.

I will take a look at my calendar and let you know when I can come north.  I 
am heading to the airport in 5 minutes for a flight to Austin to make a 
presentation at UT tonight, capping off about four weeks with a lot of travel 
for me.  I will catch my breath on the plan and look at my schedule for the 
next few weeks and I will let you know.  

I sat by Sheila Knudsen at the ENA staff meeting on Friday afternoon last 
week, and asked her if we should now schedule VP reviews.  The VP PRC meeting 
(much rescheduled) did take place on September 11 and 12.  Sheila said that 
as of Friday (the 15th) that HR had not received the final results from the 
PRC, and that we should wait on reviews until we had that in hand.  I will 
check with HR this week so see if all is finalized, so that we can schedule 
the review.  I will keep you posted.

Do you have any tentative dates for coming to Calgary?  For your information, 
Beth Perlman and Jeff Johnson are now planning to come up on October 2nd - 
3rd.   If you aren't able to come up in the next few weeks, can we cover my

Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were 
that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.   

Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated

I am not trying to twist any arms with this question, but is there anything 
we can do so that Jody can make the presentation at OU?  Since he was the top 
graduate from the Energy Management Program at OU, it would be great for him 
to be at the presentation next Tuesday night.  I know that recruiting events 
can be a drain on staffing, but it is also time well spent.  I do know that 
Jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments, so if there is not a 
feasible way to have someone calc a book for him I will understand.  I just 
wanted you to take a look at this.  Thanks.  
	
	

Lexi,

Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the OU presentation on 
Tuesday night due to business reasons.  My backup has to be out on Tuesday so 
I
will not be able to leave early enough to make it.  I will do my best to make 
it to Coach's on Tuesday night.   I apologize if this causes any 
inconveniences. 
Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.

Thanks,
Jody

Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between 
work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much 
to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and punch!  
Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I noticed some at 
a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week - 
really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have been 
doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be off the 
week of December 18th.  

I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation 
study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

Sally

I will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey 
on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15.  I will leave the offsite 
meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting 
with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common 
needs around risk systems.  I will be in the office the afternoon of 
September 15. 

Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I 
can be reached.  Key contacts while I am out are listed below:

I am not aware of an Enron-wide issue, but it would seem strange that two 
such instances occurred within your group.  You may want to contact someone 
in security to give them the details so that they can investigate.

Do you know if there is an Enron-wide credit identity theft problem ?  This 
is the second one within Global in a month.

Avril Forster@ENRON

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an Enron element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and Enron's in-house police 
officer (who works from the Enron building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Thanks,
Avril

Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, Enron's 
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding 
participation in Enron's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes 
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and 
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job 
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound 
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to 
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your 
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

 9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour 
 10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with Enron Employees and/or 
Departments
 12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

Enron has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second 
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your 
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with 
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job 
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and 
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that 
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview 
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please 
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by 
August 30, 2000.

 Department Name:

 Job Shadowing Contact Name:

 Number of Students:

 Individual to Assist With Tours:

We appreciate your consideration and participation in promoting Junior 
Achievement and Enron.

Great job on discussing status and next steps with the group this afternoon 
on OPM.  The presentation and your comments were direct and concise.  And 
your delivery of the information was very well done -- you were poised, 
organized, prepared and confident.  It was an effective and informative 
presentation to the group.  

Thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project.  

I was out of town last week doing some recruiting, so I am just reading your 
e:mail today.  I have passed this along to Lisa Cousino and she should be 
getting back to you.  

   

Eric Le Dain is renegotiating the Petro Canada contract and has a question 
with regard to costs.  Canada is allocated a portion of your groups costs via 
the service agreement and we are trying to determine what portion would be 
applicable to PetroCanada.  Can you provide me with the name of an individual 
in your group with whom I could discuss this allocation.  I'm going to have 
to provide Eric with an answer by early next week.  Thanks for your 
assistance.

This came in while I was in Austin last week, so I am just reading it today.  
Any thoughts on this one?  --Sally

January 27th and February 24th sound good.  Meagan has a big dance on Jan. 
27th, and I need to be here to help with prep and to take pictures.  February 
17th is our anniversary (22nd!!), so that is probably not a good date 
either.  So if you can make one of the other two dates work, I would love to 
come.  Just keep me posted.  

Hi, Sal!    I've been meaning to call you for several days - but it's been a
bit of a madhouse, so I thought I might fire off an e-mail:

I don't know if you've talked with Cindy in the past few days - but, if it's
okay with you, I'd like to decline your very sweet offer of having a baby
shower.   Here's the deal:  A couple of friends had already offered to do
one - and I'm having trouble coming up with a vibrant mix of people to split
amongst two showers.
This seems to be a good decision for Cindy, too, since may be a bit short of
cash and energy right now.

However, I would LOVE for you to come to the one shower - if it's convenient
for you.  I would love for you to meet my friends, and for them to meet you!
If it doesn't work for you, I'll certainly understand - especially since you
may want to come again when baby is born.  But, if you'd like to consider
coming, I'd like to know your schedule.  We're talking about a weekend lunch
or afternoon thing I think.   In January or February, I"m available on the
following weekends:
Jan. 20
Jan. 27
Feb. 17
Feb. 24.
I think going any later than this might be cutting it close!    What I need
from you is to know which of these weekends you might be available.   The
"shower planners" are getting eager to plan.  THANKS! -cara

Sally - it was great seeing you last week at the ASE in Dallas.  I'm sorry we 
didn't have the opportunity to work together in any of the groups.  As you 
may know,  I have just completed the SAP HR Implementation Project and my 
current role, working for Andrea Yowman, is to maximize our investment in SAP 
HR.
  
To that end, next Thursday, 9/14, two people from SAP will be here to 
interview non-HR managers on a new project as described below.  You have been 
identified as an excellent resource to participate in this effort, and I 
would appreciate it if you would be able to spend 1/2 hour with this team and 
have your admin spend another hour with them as well -- times noted below.

Please let me know if you are available and willing to participate in this 
initiative.  It is the beginning of our ongoing relationship with SAP to 
develop what Enron needs, and your input is considered invaluable to this 
process.  Please respond with your availability at the times noted below and 
I will prepare a final agenda and itinerary early next week.

Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort.  If you have any 
questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to call me at 
3-0363.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Proposed agenda
We would like to interview managers and their administrators.

 9:30 - 10:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#1
10:00 - 11:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#1
  
 1:00 -  1:30 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#2
 1:30 -  2:30 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#2

 2:30 -  3:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#3
 3:00 -  4:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#3

What is this project?
SAP is developing new software for managers that will be integrated with the
Workplace. It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers at
all levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by the
HR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout
SAP in the U.S. and Germany.

SAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close
to our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eight
SAP customers in the U.S. Enron is one of the eight companies we would like
to visit.

Who do we want to interview and observe?
In a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types of
managers.
* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budget
responsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends to
delegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.
* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or small
subsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget and
personnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also have
product-planning responsibilities.
* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such as
accounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but also
involved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel and
lower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.

What can you expect during a site visit?
We have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to
meet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then 
escort us to our
interviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their
objectives.  Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstations
where our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/her
daily work and asking questions.  We will then spend the next hour with 
his/her
administrative assistant.

Interviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview people
where they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of
insights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people to
be completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitive
information with utmost confidentiality.

There will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and 
administrative assistants from 
various areas in various business units.
  

Sheri Thomas (x36557), one of my direct reports, has responsibility for the 
call center that supports EnronOnline.   There is also a call center for 
Clickpaper.com.  Sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that 
effort as well.  I am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on 
their efforts and yours.  

Welcome to Enron.  It was nice to meet you last week.  --Sally

Sally,

Hi.  I am following up from our conversation during the ASE last week 
regarding Call Center/Resolution Center contacts within Enron.  As we 
discussed, I recently moved into the Customer Service Solution Manager role 
within the ISC.  I would appreciate any information (names) that you could 
provide to assist me in coordinating our efforts with those in existence 
within Enron.

Thank you,
Mary

I already have a meeting scheduled for Friday from 2:00 to 2:30.  I will join 
you in the facilitator training as soon as that meeting concludes--it may not 
last a full 30 minutes.  In case I can not make the meeting, I have printed 
the attachment.  Thanks. 

I would like to participate in this focus group, however, I will be returning 
from Austin on Friday morning following the Enron scholarship dinner the 
night before.  I am scheduled to land at Hobby at 8:45 am.  It is unlikely 
that I will be in the Enron Building before about 9:15, and I am scheduled to 
go into a meeting at 9:30 that involves a number of players and would be 
difficult to reschedule.  If your responses from participants for the Friday 
session is thin, and you schedule another time, please let me know.  

I have been out of the office on business for the last several days 
(recruiting at UT yesterday) and returned mid-morning today to a full 
schedule.  I am just now reading your e:mail and therefore could not respond 
by noon today as you had asked.  --Sally

Dear Sally,

Hope you had a good trip to Dallas, although it was a bit interrupted with
you trip back to Houston for Meagan's Open House.  Dad and I would like be
with you all on Friday the 20th of October.  I believe that may have been the
game we attended last year too.  We have meetings, the other two dates, so if
that still works for you we will plan on that date.  It also gives Dad a bit
more time to hopefully get his voice.  He returns to "DR" Bob Raley, week
after next for the results of all the testing he did this week.

Glad you will be over on Tuesday-we will look forward to seeing you then and
glad you will have time for a visit after lunch tool.

Love,

Sue

I'm in the process of putting together some slides for the presentation on

and  noted on the global operations initiative slide one of the initiatives 
listed is "creation of due diligence checklist for acquisitions." I know 
Naomi Connell has put together the SOAP which her group in London uses for 
this purpose which might be useful.  

Naomi - could you send the three of us a copy of this document?

Thanks

I was able to get into the application this time.  I could see the request 
for Shona on the screen and I clicked "Approval".  The status did not change 
from pending and there was no pop up on the screen that indicated that the

I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to "catch up", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.

Here are the home games when Meagan will be dancing in the half-time routine:

 Friday, September 15  7:00 pm

 Saturday, October 14  7:00 pm

 Friday, October 20  7:00 pm  (homecoming) 

There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if 
alternates are needed.  Nothing definitive on that, of course.  She did get 
put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.  

We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if 
it would work around one of these games.  I have also given this schedule to 
Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.  

I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.  Patti has sent you a copy of 
my itinerary.  

Shona,

I printed 12/4 consolidated report for Sally.  It is again very small.  Any 
possibility that you can change format to enlarge (very large margins).  I 
can go in every time & reformat, but it seems a waste of time to do every 
time when you can just change your template once.

PT

   

Here is the draft of the needs assessment for global standards.  Please give 
me your input.  Kelly is devoting 100% of her time to putting together an 
access database to report these standards.

Also, here is a consolidated view of A01 for 12 /04.

Thanks

Shona

Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen.  These days with Mom and 
Dad, I have asked Patti to copy you, Cindy and them on my travel plans.  That 
way all of you will have numbers where I can be reached if something were to 
come up.  Hopefully, never needed!  

Have a great time in New York later this week.  I sent you a newspaper 
article in the mail today, that you may get before you leave.  

Hey, Sal - just got your itinerary from Patty.  Sometime, just to be crazy,
we should try to travel to the same place at the same time - and we could go
out at night together!     -Cara

I will be in Dallas from Tuesday, August 29 through Thursday, August 31 at an 
offsite session hosted by Rick Causey to review the SAP implementation and 
next steps.  The linkage of Unify and our Global Databases to SAP is a 
critical one, and decisions around next steps can impact these operating 
systems and our processes.  Therefore, Rick has asked that I attend.  Patti 
Thompson, my assistant (x39106), has telephone numbers where I can be reached 
if needed.  In my absence, please contact the following persons in Houston 
with questions.  Peggy Hedstrom is the appropriate contact in Calgary.  

 Natural Gas Operations  Steve Jackson   x37070
 Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870
 
 DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242
 MPR      David Maxwell  x36983

I will be back in the office on Friday, September 1.    

 

I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on 
Friday evening.  Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group.  
His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved 
up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe.  
Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which 
resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.  Randy has a four 
year-old daughter.  

Several of us will be attending the funeral today.  Over the past several 
weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a 
fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic 
association.  Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the 
playground equipment was far exceeded.  

Have you had a chance to talk with Dave B. on any of this?  It might be 
helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone 
number and to let him know that you are working closely with Dave and that 
you are available for any questions.  Nothing may come up, but I think that 
Tom would feel better with this gesture.  Probably wouldn't hurt to log the 
same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.  That will give 
all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on 
this project.  Do you have contact information for Brenda?  If not, I would 
get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.  She is making the rounds with 
Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two 
additional paper mills that we may purchase.  

Thanks.  --Sally  

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of "what if's."  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, 
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that 
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the 
Triple Lutz data room.  

In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am 
available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come up 
that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @ 
713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITATE 
TO CALL ME!!!  I do not want anything falling through the cracks!

I have let Lexi know that I have a conflict with this meeting time -- I will 
be doing a business review meeting with Jeff Skilling on global risk 
management operations at 10:00 on September 7th.  I just wanted you to know 
that I continue to be committed to the recruiting effort at OU.  I have asked 
Lexi to update me on the meeting.  --Sally

Thanks for letting us know about Blake.  I just tried to reach him and left a 
congratulatory message on his answering machine.  

Wow - thanks for copying me on these.  --Sally

Let's let her float in that vision for a while...

Dates:  I think Brigeda probably gets out a week later than your
girls--don't mind pulling her out early is that will work best.

Cara and Chris have a wedding to attend on St. John's in June.  She thinks
she, Chris and baby will go.  Shall we give her that reality check now or
later?

It is good to be getting feedback on these standards.  After you have 
received all responses, I will be curious as to the number and nature of 
changes suggested.  I think for this to be powerful, we will need to expect 
all commodities and all locations to meet common standards.  I will reserve 
judgement on that however, pending your assessment once you have gotten all 
responses.

We have reviewed the proposed Global Standards and would like to propose two 
changes for the Calgary office:

 Function:    Deal Confirmation
 Standard:  Brokered deals confirmed within 24 hours (versus the proposed 
same day)

 Function:    Deal Confirmation
 Standard:  Deliver confirmation within 48 hours (versus the proposed 24 
hours)

In order for us to meet the originally proposed standards, we would either 
require additional staffing or a reduction of the review process for our 
transactions.
Let me know if you have any questions or require additional clarification.  I 
can be reached at ext. 6753.
Peggy

   
	
	

As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

Thank you,

Shona

Not too mountainous, but I am sure that would be fun.  It's kind of hard to 
fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic 
between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's 
family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental 
through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group 
of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from 
Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something 
like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that 
could be tough.  

Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or 
three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, 
etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places 
and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems 
like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you 
and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?  Our kids will get out of 
school on Friday, May 25.  The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.  

We are having a great year here at Enron, especially in the business unit 
that I am in.  Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early 
February.  I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for 
everyone.  

Just talked to Cara who talked to Mom about the anniversary trip--Cara
thinks she wants Bermuda....

The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice 
Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is 
set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice 
Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming 
that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule 
your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your 
review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process 
along with Peggy and Brent.)

On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for 
Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this 
event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the 
location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your 
calendars:  November 15-17.  

Let me know if you have any questions on either one of these.  

Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office 
in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought 
processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations 
personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.  
While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good 
option.  

I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After 
several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a 
practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no 
meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your 
document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a 
note then if there are any other comments that I have.  

I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while 
you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some 
concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my 
schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the 
calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he 
is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person 
sometime in the not too distant future.  

Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business 
controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a 
location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential 
dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a 
long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join 
us.  

I am not available to interview on December 7th.  I will be in a PRC 
meeting.  Try me next time!  --Sally 

   

Dear Team Members:

For those of you who are still interested in conducting interviews, we have 
one last chance for you to volunteer one hour of your time!

Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -12:30 p.m.

We are asking Enron employees associate (associates who have been with the 
program for at least one year) level or higher  to volunteer at least ONE 
HOUR to interview candidates (this will be 2 interviews).  If you can 
volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the stated 
dates, that would be great!  

Your help is needed!  Please contact  Cathy Lira, at cathy.lira@enron.com or 
x54049 as soon as possible, if you can volunteer any time for interviewing.  
Please include the times that you can interview and whether or not you will 
be able to join us for breakfast and lunch.  

There will be a breakfast buffet from 7:45 a.m. to 8:45 a.m.  and a luncheon 
from 12:30 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.  Interviewers are welcome to attend both the 
breakfast and the lunch on their interviewing date. 

Thank you in advance!

I received the note about the Wellesley recruiting team meeting on Thursday.  
I will look forward to seeing you there. 

Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?  I will be there.  I did let 
Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about 
mid afternoon on Thursday.  Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, 
and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the 
teachers.  With this being Amanda's   first year in junior high, it is 
important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so 
that I can best support her in school.  Mary Solmonson and Brent from my team 
will be there for the duration.  I look forward to seeing you there, too!  
--Sally  

On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's 
cars.  On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of 
money for a school project.  Last night, the magazine made it into my hands 
around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.  What a 
nice article!  I smiled while reading it.  How nice to see your 
accomplishments recognized in print.  Congratulations.  I hope that you have 
plenty of copies for your mom and dad.  --Sally 

Glad you got some rain.  We are still doing lots of watering on the yard.  No 
water rationing in our area yet, but it has been put in place in many areas 
in and around Houston. 

I have to be in Austin for a presentation and reception late afternoon on 
September 5, so I thought that it would be fun to try to come earlier and 
have lunch for your birthday.  I haven't made flight reservations yet, but I 
am sure that I can work it to be at the University Club by 12:15.  

Looks as if the whole family will go to Hallettsville on the 9th.  David and 
I will enjoy the drive, and I am sure that the girls will enjoy the sleep on 
the way over!   

SueW2@aol.com on 08/22/2000 04:05:45 PM
Sally, I think will get out and do an Indian Rain dance, as the rain is
falling and we need lots ot that!  MY reason for writing however, is to say
that we will look forward to your having lunch with us at 12:15 on September
5th at the University of Texas Club.  Cindy said you would be in town and
that would be a fun celebration, and Cindy and family will join us.  I am
also going to invite my cousins, Fab and Mary Anne.  Cara will in New York at
that time.

The other is, I am thrilled that you and your family are going to be able to
go to Hallettsville for Dot's birthday and Cindy, Richard, and Brigeda will
be able to be there also as they were able to change their plans for the
beach to the following week-end, so I think it will be lots of  fun, and I
know it will mean a lot to Dot too.  In fact I called her today and told her
you all were going to be able to be there.  Cara will decide when she gets
home from CA I guess,  She will be home from New York on the 7th.

Love,

Mom

Beth Perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system.  It does not 
work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am 
confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand 
that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put 
into production?  

I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a 
voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally 
okayed the access for Bob Hall.  

Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and 
how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system 
is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on 
these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system 
is fixed.  

My number is 35926.  I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and 
timing.

Hello Wellesley Recruiting Team,

You have been chosen to represent and assist in the Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at Wellesley College for Enron's Associate/Analyst Program.

We are excited  about the upcoming association,and welcome you to the team. We
have arranged an evening meeting to discuss the details.

Please read the following attachment for information concerning the meeting
time and place.  If you will not be able to attend, please r.s.v.p your 
regrets.

See you soon!

Recruiter, Geynille Dillingham
Coordinator, Debbie Flores

Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show.  Beverly Scott, 
with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating.  She offered to call 
all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits.  I was 
planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that 
I decided to take her up on it.  She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, 
so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a 
list of names and numbers).  I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she 
had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't 
called everyone on the list.  I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose 
outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I 
know that she is working on it.  Just a little more slowly than I would 
like!  

I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today 
and make calls.  Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just 
coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.  Her number at work is 281-444-0751.  

Beverly Gibson <bgibson50606@yahoo.com> on 08/23/2000 10:31:41 AM
Sally:

Are you still planning on using Harold Powell for the
Fashion Show?  If so, when should the girls go to
choose something?  We are in a time bind this weekend
because my older daughter is moving back to UT.

Please let me know if you need any help.

I met with Karen Marshall today.  She is in the Community Relations group and 
is organizing the dinner on September 7th.  I suggested that she add to the 
invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger 
Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last 
year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this 
summer).  I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on 
appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know 
people at the school. I will keep you posted.  --Sally 
	
	

	

Attached is the Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholars Dinner invitation.  RSVP 
Karen Marshall at 713-853-7632 or Melinda Nelson at 512-471-7603.

         

Was Lisa a recent hire that Susan Harrison brought in?  I don't immediately 
recognize her name, but wonder if that's who this is.  

Also, I left you a message about Bob Klein's resignation, as I learned from 
Jeff Sorenson.  I am sure that Jeff has communicated this to you.  --Sally 

   

Sally, 
FYI, Lisa Peterson turned in her voluntary resignation today and it is 
effective today by her own choice.   
She has personal issues that she feels she needs to take care of and she also 
reported that the job was not what she had hoped for.   We have her 
resignation letter on file.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Thanks for the follow up.  Please move forward with this offer with the sign 
on payment.  Thanks. 

   

Sally, 
In answer to your question regarding the approval process for sign on 
bonuses, Sheila Walton informed me of the following. 
If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,  
then no further approval process is necessary.     If the sign on bonus 
amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   
In our current case, a $5,000.00 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not 
require additional approval except your own.   
I will continue to monitor sign on bonus offers and provide you with a 
recommendation based on all available factors.

hgm

John,

Please let me know if these look like the final ones.  Thanks for your help.

Same time, same place -- just not as often!

I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 
2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM 
meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and 
EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team 
meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM 
management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you 
and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global 
Markets.  

I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the 
calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line 
reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the 
professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time 
together on an as needed basis.  

If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the 
cruise, let me know.  My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on 
Wednesday night.  If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day 
for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.  This 
is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in 
response from others. But do let me know...

I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for 
this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.  My husband 
has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in 
school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two 
year-old during prime homework hours.  Patti has some names that I have 
suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.  Very 
few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy 
Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks 
have this on their calendars.  You may need some of the names that Patti has 
for you.  
I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process 
of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work 
for me.  

   

Dear UT Recruiting Team Members:

As most of you should know, we are scheduled to participate in the MPA Dinner 
Cruise on Lake Austin Wednesday, August 23 at 6:30pm.  We are co-sponsoring 
this event with KPMG, so our presence is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!

Rick Causey will be unable to attend as he has been chosen for jury duty!!! I 
have also had a few participants notify me that they will be unable to attend.

With this in mind, I am hoping that you will make yourself available to 
participate in this event.  

Please respond via e-mail or give me a call (3-4585) and let me know if you 
will be able to represent Enron at this event.  I will then give you the 
logistics for the event.  It is scheduled to begin at 6:30, so we are 
expected to arrive between 6:00 and 6:15.

Please let me know ASAP if you will be able to help.

Thank you!

I like the trip idea better than a party, personally, so I am glad that Mom 
and Dad seemed to like that alternative.  And in June, I think that the 
mountains sound great.  I have a preference for Western mountains -- big, 
open sky  (Grand Tetons could be great), but if Mom pictures North Carolina 
as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.  We were in Ashville a 
couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.  We stayed at a 
place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.  I am 
sure that there are other places in the area to research.  There may also be 
some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.  I think 
that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around 
and see if there are any good suggestions.  In magazines, I have seen 
pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains) 
that look nice.  I will see if I can find the names of those places.  

Thanks for pursuing this with Mom and Dad.  --Sally 

Met Mom and Dad for dinner last night.  I did some pushing for the
anniversary decision.  Mom was quite adamant about not liking cruises (Mom,
adamant?  What a shock!).  What did seem to appeal was a trip to the
mountains (really!).  She's think of N.C.--probably blue ridge.  I know
there are some ski resorts there--something like that would also offer our
little and not-so-little ones something to do.  I've been searching the web
for places during lunch.  Will compile some info and let you know...

The record on Friday showed that 127 employees from Energy Operations had 
pledged dollars to the United Way campaign.  Large number, but still 
percentage-wise smaller than we would like.  I sent the message below to all 
Energy Operations employees on Friday afternoon.  We'll see in a few days if 
this helped on contributions.  

Text of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:

Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that 
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find 
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster 
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to 
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin 
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were 
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to 
have made that pledge.  

Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive 
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit 
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your 
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time 
each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a 
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an 
employee is matched by Enron.  

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing 
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next 
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a 
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron 
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to 
http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.

Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic 
pledge.

Sally, Brent,
There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices.
Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra 
controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in 
New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.

is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
All the cc above are bought in to this approach.
What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and 
Buy?

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Thanks,
Richard

Call or e:mail - either one is great.  I do hope that you are working with 
James directly on these issues as they surface.  It is still not clear to me 
whether or not you two have spent time together on these issues.  I will 
always support whatever changes can be made to our processes or controls that 
will insure better information.  Because I can't personally do all of the 
work, I just want to be sure that you are plugged in to work directly with 
the right management team members on my team.  

I don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work.  I believe that 
the manual process that moves information from the Entelligence team to GCP 
has apparently not worked as well as was designed.  While sorry that the 
results haven't been as expected, we are glad to have your input now to help 
address this.  James has reassigned the resources from Entelligence for now 
to work with Mary Gosnell on updates to GCP that I understand have been 
prioritized with you.  

   

	
	                           
	

Sally,

I raised this issue only to make sure you were aware of the duplication of 
work going on in these groups. Although I fully support your teams, it is 
painfully obvious that the process is not working as well as we would hope.

 Let me know if it would be more appropriate to call you on this type issue 
going forward.

Debbie

   

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.   

   

	
	                           
	

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

I am resending this memo regarding the information that I need from you as 
Cheryl Ingstad's supervisor as I prepare to represent her in the Associates 
PRC meeting next week.  I am tied up in other PRC meetings on December 7, 8 
and 11, so I am doing my homework earlier rather than later this week.  
Please note the bullet points in the memo below which outline the information 
that I need.  I do have copies of the internal feedback forms and Cheryl's 
self-evaluation.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I know that things 
are very busy right now, but it is important to the Associates that their 
reps in the PRC process are well prepared.  Your input will help me with 
that.  Thanks. --Sally 

I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will 
take place on December 12.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates 
to represent in the meeting as indicated below.  The Associates Program has 
provided me with your name as the supervisor of record as of October 1 of the 
Associate as listed.  

Please send the following information to me by December 1.  

Associate's accomplishments for the second half of 2000 (prepared by the 
associate or summarized by you) 

Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any 
additional rotational assignments during this last six months of the year) 

Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion 
on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, 
Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues) 

Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately 
representing the associate in the PRC process

Recommendation for promotion, if any 

I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP 
system through the Associates Program.  

I will be at a management conference Thursday and Friday of this week, then 
on vacation until Monday, November 27.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, will be 
contacting you next week to arrange a time to meet or talk by phone during 
the week of November 27 or December 4 to discuss your associate and his/her 
performance in more detail.  I will also contact the Associates and meet with 
them individually in preparation for the PRC meeting.  

Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC 
supervisor for the Associate listed above,  please reply by e:mail as soon as 
possible and my assistant will research where I should go next for this 
input.  

I have this on my calendar.  At this point, I do not plan to bring anyone 
else to the meeting.  --Sally

Rick has asked that I schedule a Business Review session with Jeff Skilling 
early in September.  Jeff is available on September 7 from 10:00 - 11:00.
The meeting is scheduled for Jeff's office.  If you plan to bring anyone with 
you to the meeting please let me know and we will need to move to a larger 
room.

The meeting will be divided into 3  20 minute sessions:

SAP Update   Melissa Becker
Strategic Sourcing  George Wasaff
Global Risk Mgmt/Doorstep Sally Beck

Sorry that I missed you this morning.  I attended that last Financial Council 
meeting on SAP this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with Mark Frevert 
and Rick Causey.  Nothing substantial came up on Helsinki, so it was fine 
that we didn't get to talk today.  I had wanted to be prepared on how to 
address out current activities there.  So I can get an update on that when we 
talk tomorrow.

I have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 9:00 to 10:00 
tomorrow.   I will call you around 10:00 when I get back from that meeting.  

I got your voice mail message and I understand your concerns around Todd's 
time.  I think we have it backwards for James to dictate how and when Todd's 
help would be needed.  I think that we can review the "to do" list from James 
and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, 
what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing 
the work, etc.  As I said originally, I knew that Todd would not be 
interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency 
(remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the 
work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance 
and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work 
himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these 
efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional 
short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have 
to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If 
you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him 
to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all 
of the work.  I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as 
the contracted hired help!  Let me know what you think.  --Sally 

Brent A Price

I don't see any huge problems with Todd helping out Continental Power.  He 
needs to spend some time in Oslo anyways reviewing the weather business 
there.  I agree that one month might be unreasonable and would look to Todd 
to determine the proper timeframe.  I will talk to Todd and Mike Jordan 
regarding the best way to proceed with this.

   

As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special 
projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd 
completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of 
his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely 
with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one 
month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and 
determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over 
there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I 
don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly 
without the family.  Can we still use Todd ?  
James New
08/16/2000 07:54 AM
Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Thanks and regards James

I will be there!  --Sally 

   
	
	

Just a reminder we will have the initial meeting of the ENA/ AA Roundtable on 
Friday at 9:00am in room EB30C1.  Again, the agenda is as follows:

Discussion of PRC
Immediate and future AA needs by business unit
Skill shortages
Campus and off-cycle recruitment
Mottom 10% management
Projecting AA needs from core schools for Summer 2001 intake
Existing talent in specialist roles who should be in AA Program
Ideas/suggestions on how we improve the Program/ENA retention

Your groups need to be represented and if you can't attend please send 
someone to represent you.  Those of you out of town need to call me if you 
have any input.    Thanks again for all your support.  Ted

Todd is completing his short-term role on the CommodityLogic team, and it is 
my hope that he will be able to provide some help for you after that is 
completed, while also working in his role with Weather.  I have sent a 
message to Brent and I am sure that we will talk.  --Sally

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special 
projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd 
completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of 
his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely 
with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one 
month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and 
determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over 
there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I 
don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly 
without the family.  Can we still use Todd ?

Thanks for taking the time to give me your input on the analyst program.  It 
will help to have that info in my meeting on Friday.  

Cathy:  slight wording change from Rick Causey:  add words at beginning of 
third sentence in italics and drop the phrase "on accounting issues and 
reporting earnings" at the end of that third sentence.  Thanks.  Clear as 
mud?  --Sally

 Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of

Products and Coal.  In addition, Tom Myers has joined Brent's management team 
as Director of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all 
accounting, risk reporting and trading operations for all the businesses 
within EGM. 

Rick:  This is a draft of the language to be used in a McConnell/Shankman 
memo to go out on their new organization.  I worked with Mike on the language 
for this paragraph.  Any comments or suggested changes?
Mike would like to send this out ASAP, ideally this afternoon.  Thanks for 
taking a look.

As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent 
with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power 
business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As 
part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and 
decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, 
this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic 
direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a 
pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon 
starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The 
Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The 
meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, 
staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on 
this Friday.  

Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire 
meeting and to be on time.  

Regards
Delainey

As a result of the creation of the Global Markets business in the last few 
days, I would add the following persons to the attendee list for the ASE in 
Dallas:

 Brent Price  VP Operations and CAO, Global Markets
 Tom Myers  Director of Accounting, Global Markets

Brent is in London this week, and will be on vacation the week of August 21.  
With the demands of a new role, Brent will be best able to address the 
feasibility of one or both of them attending.

Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran 
through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number.  
I think that I saw yours.  Did I miss you sometime this weekend?  With almost 
two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down 
the list in importance.  I an never quite sure that I get messages that 
anyone calls!  Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during 
my commute tonight again.  

Hope you had a good weekend.  Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and 
continuing the search for new clothes.  Our friend Mo was in town from London 
and had burgers with us on Saturday night.    --Sally 

Thanks for the update on Dad.  Keep me posted on what you hear.  No, I didn't 
get the message that Cara had called.  With almost two teenagers in the 
house, my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance!  I 
will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from 
work.  --Sally  

Did you get the message the Cara called you yesterday?  I THINK SHE HAS
SOMETHING SHE WANT TO TELL YOU...

Delved a little bit into the Dad health issue.  Apparently he's still not
feeling too well--very fatigued, diahrea (sp?), not gaining weight, etc.
plus the voice thing.  He went to the dr on Friday--I don't think they know
exactly what to do...Cara and I have suggested a nutritionist but, you know,
Mother knows nutrition so I guess that is not needed....

I don't think Dad looks very good but I don't think he has for a while....

I am sorry that you won't be here to join us for the lunch for Kristin.  It 
was a trick getting a date that worked for her schedule and mine.  Since this 
is her last official week with ENA, I did want to do this before she starts 
her new assignment.  --Sally

I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding 
responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17 
instead of August 28.   I will keep you posted.  

I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's 
new role.  I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve 
Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.  I am confident that this will work 
well.  

FYI:  Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him.  By voice mail, I 
suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting.  We are 
set for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over 
lunch.  I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of 
the meeting and to be certain that I have his support.  Rick Causey suggested 
citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert.  Any 
words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?  

Hope that everything is fun and relaxing in Maine.  --Sally 

Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.  

Life is busy at Enron and I literally receive hundreds of e:mails every 
week.  This is not the best way to communicate with me on priority issues.  I 
have looked at your proposal and would be interested in learning more.  Can 
you provide more details beyond your presentation?  What is your background 
and experience?  Can you provide information on your company?   

ConfirmCorp@aol.com on 08/01/2000 09:16:40 AM
Sally:

Since I have not heard back from you is it safe to assume that you are not
interested learning more about how Enron can automate its confirmation
process?  If this is the case, would it be okay if I approached someone else
in your organization about the idea?

Thanks for your consideration.

Chris Papousek

I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu.  If you 
look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.  His e:mail to 
Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's 
group.  Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a 
group in which they may have an interest.  I don't think that HR gets 
involved in this process.  I am not sure how I got into this loop.  It seems 
that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his 
group then he should talk with Nelson.  --Sally 

   

Sally,
 I think this one is for you.  Please do with it as you see fit.

Hi Allan:

I  am  writing  you  to express my strong interest in working at Enron Net 
Works
International Private Equity.  I am confident that my experience has prepared 
me
with  the  broad  skills  and finance expertise necessary for success in 
Private
Equity.

The rigorous curriculum in the Anderson School at UCLA has not only confirmed 
my
interest in Finance, but also enhanced my accounting skills. After 
graduation, I
spent  the first four months of my rotation program in Enron at the Asia 
Pacific
Structuring  Group. There I honed my analytical skills, commercial knowledge 
and
cross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk 
assessment.
I  provided  robust  analytical  support that resulted in a successful bid 
for a
$550  million  power  project in China.  In the past five months at the 
Business
Development   Group  of  Enron  Broadband  Services,  I  managed  the  
strategic
relationship  between  Enron  and  Microsoft. The deal management tasks 
required
broad-based   problem-solving   skills,   effective   communication  and  
strong
understanding  of  the technology market. Recently I also proposed and led a 
new
initiative in developing broadband online gaming content for the Enron 
streaming
media business.

I  have  attached  my resume which details my accomplishments. I look forward 
to
speaking with you and further discuss my credentials in a personal interview.

I have been on jury duty since Tuesday this week - I had Patti call Chris 
today and let him know that I would get back with him next week.  I will keep 
you posted as I have time to focus on that next week.  Thanks for following 
up!  --Sally 

   

Sally:

What is to become of Chris Hoyle?  There is no doubt that his interviewers 
liked him, but will he be extended a full-time offer by any of the groups?

Definitely clever!  I wish that I had thought of the changing the clock thing 
when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.  

I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math 
skills.  I will definitely look into that for Meagan.  

I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have 
called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the 
beans, but no movement on that yet!  

I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be 
dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz;  
not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs:  
a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more 
for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines 
is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next 
two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season.  
I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs 
will be next week.  I will keep you posted.  

Have a great weekend.  Love, Sally 

Sally,

Wish we could meet downtown for lunch--if only we weren't in different
downtown!

Bummer about Meagan--I agree that physics and precalc would be a killer.
You've probably looked into this but there are some great computer
"games/drills" for math.  Brigeda does the early ones but there are some for
the heavy duty stuff as well...

Amanda must have aced that lock/locker and changing classes thing if she
loves her classes...

Brigeda doesn't start until the 21st.  It is always a strange week when all
the other kids (and her best friend) is in school--kind of waiting week but
we should be getting ready for her party.

GREAT IDEA:  I'm going to change the clocks in my house the night of the
slumber party--to 2 hour ahead.  So they can have their midnight swim and
snack (at 10pm!).  I don't know whether this makes me a creepy or clever
mom...

Let me know when you get Meagan's football schedule...Brigeda has been
moaning about wishing she was in Houston since we left...

Today is Cara's appt with the gyn/ob--maybe an announcement will be
forthcoming.

I'm meeting a guy I took my web certification classes with on Monday.  He
owns a design firm in Georgetown and has some freelance work.  It would be
great to be able to accelerate our return to solvency!

Talk to you soon...

Cindy

That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great
too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited
about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for
the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day
"sucked".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant
principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was
thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive
enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which
is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to
the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but
luckily I didn't have to go that far.

Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally

Sally (and yes, I did check thrice to make sure I had the right Sally!),

Thought I'd let you know that I found a rental of IN SEARCH OF THE
CASTAWAYS.  Thought it might be good for the slumber party--we've got a
tropical island theme going....

Thanks for copying me on this.  It is interesting to see your thoughts.  I 
suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.  I 
told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.  However, I 
also told him about my two dark-side fears:  (1)  that IT resources reporting 
to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on 
projects that we need, and (2)  taken to the extreme, that this concept would 
disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to 
managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this 
special team for them to handle.  Part of the fun in operations is improving 
things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the 
chance to implement creative business solutions.  

Richard Sage
08/11/2000 10:10 AM
Mike,
Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
EnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for "What happens if we completely stop development of X project?". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

Start small to prove concept
E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields
This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but 
for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be 
years before we can switch off many internal systems.
We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 
years out?

Include European aspects from the beginning
This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense 
Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development 
from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower 
which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!

80-20 rule for types of transaction
EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.
Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk 
(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, 
and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual 
approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many 
different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which 
makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of 
certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and 
manually tweaked every so often)

Testing
Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not 
pay) to do much of the testing.
EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to 
have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different 
phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.
EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many 
external users early in the process. It did have massive 
resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the 
Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the 
same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear "short people", that 
strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional 
resource, even after MG is absorbed.

What else did you come up with?
Richard

Do we have these numbers for Hector?

Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.

David is doing well, too.  He is working contract, having quit Burlington 
Resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible.  
Yes, Tammy is still with us.  We marked our 10 year anniversary with her in 
March, except for that six month period when she was with her dad in 
Kentucky.  I truly am blessed.  --Sally 

   

	
	                           
	

Sally --

How's David?  Do you still have Tammy watching the kids?  I'm amazed that 
Tyler is already 2 1/2.  I bet he is just precious -- boys just have so much 
energy and are so soft-hearted.  I'm sure you feel so blessed -- you are.

Wishing you a good day,
Griff

   

It was great to see a friendly face!  Don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in 
and say hello.  Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the 
summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!  It is kind 
of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations 
has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so 
many others.  

My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will 
be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for 
an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she 
starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is 
"two and a half".  What a delight he continues to be!!  
 
I know that Erin has worked hard.  I hope that she and her husband are doing 
well.  --Sally

I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m.  I was so excited to know you 
were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't 
control my enthusiasm over seeing you.

I apologize if I disrupted you.

Griff

P.S.  I hope your family is doing fine.  Erin graduates in December from 
UT-Dallas with her masters in Speech Path.  She and her husband are doing 
very well and very much in love.

Can you arrange with Bobbi?  Thanks.

I understand that the return e:mail that I sent to Kim Rizzi on November 27th 
was not opened by HR.  Please note on my e:mail below that I had asked for 
clarification on Brent Price.  This was the second e:mail that I had sent to 
Kim regarding Brent with no reply back.  My first message had noted for Kim 
that Brent was left out of my list, and asked whether or not Rick Causey 
planned to supply a pre-ranking for Brent or if I needed to do so.  Can you 
clarify this for me?  Brent reports to me as the head of operations for EGM 
and to Rick Causey in his role as CAO of EGM.  

Here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level:

   Superior  Excellent Strong Satisfactory    Needs Improv.  Issues

VP's      Price  Hedstrom
      Hall

Sr. Directors Solmonson Reeves Herod Scribner

Directors  Thomas  Mills  Superty Henenberg Perez   
      Wilson   Venturatos
      

 

I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.  You had 
included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.  Brent Price's 
name is missing.  I would put him in the Excellent category at this time.  
Let me know if you need anything else.  It is possible that I may change a 
few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct 
reports who supervise certain directors.   I will let you know.  --Sally

Sally,

Attached is a spreadsheet with pull down boxes allowing you to assign 
preliminary rankings of your people.  If you have any questions please let me 
know.

Please assign preliminary ratings and return the spreadsheet to me by close 
of business Wednesday, November 29th.

Thanks,
Kim

Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.  I saw Amy Leeand 
Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.  Please pass the kudos 
along to the rest of your team.  The theme was timely, the staging was great, 
the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron 
employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.  (I knew the 
WLEC 1 answer!)  

I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday.  Their programs 
are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the 
children in the shelter.  

To all Energy Operations employees:

ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially 
proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.  
I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that 
you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you 
for that.  

Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA 
and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make 
sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and 
that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will; 
to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we 
could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools" 
and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants 
who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will 
meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight 
our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, 
and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.  
Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that 
input.  

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only 
through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  
Thank you.

Sally 

Can you help me on this?  Can you give me the name of someone who sends 
messages from ARSystem@ect.com?  To make matters even more frustrating, when 
I tried to e:mail back to get some clarification, I got a message that said 
my e:mail was undeliverable.  No contact name, no phone number, and no 
ability to e:mail back.  I'm stuck!!  Thanks.  --Sally 

Is there a person who can attach a name and number to this request?  I 
receive many requests daily and I have yet to see any two alike.  Makes it 
tough on someone to act on these, especially when sent without a name or 
contact number if there is a question.   When I click on the address included 
in this message, someone else's name comes up (Steve Beck).  I don't know who 
you are, what you want me to do, or if you even have the right person.

Dear Rick:

As you may know, I have recently assumed the duties of PPA/MPA Director at
The University of Texas at Austin. In my new capacity, I shall be
responsible for the 2000 Fall Lyceum Series, scheduled by my predecessor,
Dr. Don Tidrick.

I understand that you will be addressing our 4th Year PPA students on
"Global Equity Markets" in the Lyceum on Wednesday, November 1, from 5:00
to 6:30 p.m. (approximately), in UTC 2.102A. Both the students and I are
looking forward to your presentation.

In advance of the presentation, could you provide me with a brief biography
for introduction purposes?

If you have any questions concerning the Lyceum, or if I can facilitate
your Lyceum presentation in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,

The United Way Executive Solicitiation is underway.  You should have received 
an e:mail message about a week or ten days ago which let you know that you 
this year pledges should be made on line.  Mark Frevert reminded everyone at 
today's ENA staff meeting to complete their pledges by Tuesday, August 8.  If 
you have not already done so, I would encourage you to complete your pledges 
before Tuesday.  Patti Thompson can tell you where to go on line to do this.  

Peggy:  United Way may not apply in Canada, so ignore this if not 
appropriate.  

Yeah!!  Yes, staff meeting is 2:30 to 3:30 on Mondays in EB3014  - convenient 
for you at this point.

Sorry that I didn't get to call you on my way to the courthouse yesterday. I 
was conducting lots of business back and forth with the Houston office during 
the drive and just ran out of time.  We reconvene in court this morning, to 
have what I hope will be final deliberation on sentencing, having found the 
guy guilty on both counts,  (Prior to the start of a trial, the defendant 
must choose either judge or jury to administer the sentence if the defendant 
is found guilty - he chose the jury.)  I am in the office now for an 8:30 
meeting with Jeff Skilling regarding the upcoming Associates PRC meeting, to 
which I am a rep.  If I don't get a chance to reach you today, I will call 
during my commute tomorrow.  --Sally 

By the way, I thought that when I put "Energy Executive" as my occupation on 
the jury summons form, that I would be deemed to be too conservative and too 
corporate to be chosen for the jury.  Not the case!  In fact, Mark Koenig 
(Enron's EVP of Investor Relations) was summoned for jury duty on Tuesday as 
well, and he too was chosen to be on a different jury!  The whole thing is 
actually very fascinating - just bad timing for me to be out so much this 
week.  But then, there never is a good time.

It must be your honest face  - I never get picked as I always look like I am 
on the extreme end of a right wing law and order party/movement  -ie serious 
penalties for parking tickets etc. I am not like that but it is just a porr 
perception !!

Look forward to the call otherwise we can catch up later

Mike

   

I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris  
County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case.  
The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference 
call may not work.  I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way 
in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time.  

Please note:

Per Sally, the 9:00 AM Doorstep meeting scheduled for Friday (tomorrow) is 
being shortened to 30 minutes (now 9:30-10:00 AM).

Thanks,

Scott will be in negotiations and will not have his cell phone or pager on.  
He will check voice mails frequently.  I will be available to take messages 
also.

Requesting update access for what?  (can't tell from this request what it is 
that you want me to approve) 

Is this request for Sheila Glover or Rebecca Ford?  (unclear) 

Next to Sheila's name is the word Trader.  Is this supposed to be her 
title?   She is not a trader.  She is a Business Controller.  

Can you provide some clarification so that I can act upon this?  Thanks for 
your earlier phone message, Leola.  This is still a bad process and the 
information is not sufficient to give an approval.

To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000.  
His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
category.  

Sheila, 
I want to update you on Steve Schwarz' status.   He recently transfered to 
EBS.  Sally Beck will be giving him his performance review and I will forward 
it.
Thanks, hgm

Hope that the trip goes well.  It should be interesting to look at that 
business.  Keep me posted.  --Sally 

   
	
	

Sally,
Gary wants me in NY tomorrow and the rest of the week.  Trena, from London,  
and I are meeting in NY tomorrow noon.  We are assessing the FX brokerage 
business of Rudolf Wolfe, the business MG had purchased recently before our 
takeover.

Sheila

This was great -- and I saw myself in a number of these!!  It must be too 
long -- but that is who I am right now!  --Sally 

Can't remember at this point what the question was!  Thanks for following up

Hi Sally,

The other day you stopped by my desk to ask me a question, but then you had 
to leave suddenly.  Did you still need to ask me something?  I just wanted to 
follow up with you.

Thank you,
Becky

Did you mean to send that e:mail to me?  It was Greek to me, and I assume 
that the Sally it was meant for was that Sally Conover.  Feels like a Monday, 
doesn't it?  --Sally 

To my surprise, I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge.  
The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on 
Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.  I will be back here working after trial 
hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the 
proceedings.  I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is 
fulfilled!  

Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.  I sat by 
Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve 
on another jury.  

Sally is out of the office today, but checking her calendar for Wed or Thurs 
of that week, it looks like Wednesday, Aug 9 would be a good day for her.  
She or I will confirm that date with you when she returns to the office on 
Monday.

Thanks for the info.  If you'd like to see the logo the team selected, you 
can go to luminant.com.  Hit login (upper right corner) and go to userid 
(tgros) and password (commoditylogic). Touch the "look and feel" icon and see 
the logos.  We selected the first one  in row A.
Enjoy the college hunting!

FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this 
week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be 
back in the office on Wednesday of next week. 

Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If 
not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next 
Wednesday.   

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process 
and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back 
in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff 
Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours 
that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and 
compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which 
activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed  
to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the 
best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm 
group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for 
implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.  

I will be out of the office from Wednesday, July 26 through Friday, July 28.  
I am taking my older daughter on a preliminary look at colleges.  I will have 
my cell phone with me -- the number is 713-417-1591.   My assistant, Patti

Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy  

   

I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in 
the office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  
Together we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an 
excellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with 
Mark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation 
preparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.  We will keep you 
posted on both items.  --Sally

Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial 
confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have 
been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the 
most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not 
happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation 
went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is 
there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the 
financial confirmations to Calgary.  
	
	

Peggy,

As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who

by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to

How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to 
hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to 
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, 
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the 
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand 
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the 
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still 
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe 
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers 
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's 
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings 
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their 
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because 
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob 
Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and 
handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with 
you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, 
potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can 
fill you in on the details in that situation.  

Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?

Since Dianne Seib is currently on vacation, I am reviewing the financial 
confirms.  For the referenced confirm, the status is currently showing 'Sent 
to Counterparty", although our records show that we have not yet approved the 
revised confirm.  Can you check on this for me and let me know whether this 
was sent prior to receiving Calgary's approval?  If you have any questions, I 
can be contacted at ext. 6753.
Thanks
Peggy

I have been traveling on business and also have just returned from vacation, 
so I have not yet seen the proposal that you referenced.  I will hopefully 
discover it as I go through my inbox in the next few days.

Dear Sally:

I hope you have had an opportunity to review the proposal I sent over to
Connie Sutton regarding Confirmation Clearing Corporation.  I am hoping Enron
will seriously consider moving to an electronic confirmation process and reap
all the benefits automation has to offer.  As an industry leader, this would
be another innovative move by Enron.

If you would like to discuss the possibilities, I would appreciate the
opportunity to visit with you.

Please call or respond via e-mail at your convenience.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Chris Papousek
President, Confirmation Clearing Corporation
(713)823-4800

Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she 
will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep 
will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both 
wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you 
can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a 
way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new 
role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.

for Drew & Beth is 

  Thursday, July 20, 2000
  8:00 - 9:00 a.m. (Houston Time)

Attached is a preliminary draft of the findings and proposed action steps for 
the MG - London controls review that was conducted this past week.  These 
findings arise solely out of discussions with key MG personnel who are listed 
within the attachment.  AA&Co. are still in the process of conducting the 
deal test which should be completed by Monday.  Any significant findings as a 
result of the deal test will then be added to this document.  Please review 
and direct any questions or comments back to me or Tim Poullain-Patterson by 
Monday, July 10.  Thanks.

Is there anything that I can do to help you and Jo?  Tyler has school on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays, but my nanny is at home with him on the other days.  
Would it help for her to take Albert?  --Sally

Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be 
reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at 
that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato 
and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in 
representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your 
accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey 
for reference during that process.  

Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be 
completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you 
for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  

Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact 
course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good.  
All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day 
course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact 
Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.  

I will be hosting a cookout at my home for OU summer interns, recently hired 
OU grads and the OU recruiting team on Sunday, July 30th in the late 
afternoon.  More details will follow soon, but I wanted to let you know the 
date so that you can hold this on your calendar.  

I will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.  And my husband 
will be glad to be surrounded by many fellow Sooners!  

Thanks for the update.  I am confident that with leadership from you and 
attention from Bryce that AEC will be satisfied soon.  --Sally

requested (i.e., one month of data), and are awaiting their approval before 
completing the analysis on the remaining months.  I am confident that we have 
established clear points of contact within Settlements for Mike and Bill and 
we will continue to work on solidifying the relationship.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Rob:  Let me know if you get feedback from AEC that does not indicate that 
they are getting what they need.  Susan and Bryce are both very capable and

Please join us for an informal lunch on Friday, July 21st in the dining room 
in EB50M.   Rick Causey, Enron's executive lead for the Analyst Program, and 
David Haug, Enron's executive lead for the Associates Program, have been 
invited to join us as well.  We are interested in renewing acquaintances with 
those of you whom we met on campus and in getting to know those of you whom 
we did not see in the interview process.  We hope that you are enjoying your 
summer assignments at Enron and we look forward to the opportunity to visit 
over lunch.  

Please let me know by return e:mail if you will be able to attend the lunch.  

Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior 
Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process 
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton 
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting 
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should 
be the end of July.  

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to 
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.  
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not 
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single 
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you 
updated on this as I get direction from him.  

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In 
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review 
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when 
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be 
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups 
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, 
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view 
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the 
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that 
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees 
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory 
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas 
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in 
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  

Also please note the following: 

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or 
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given 
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with 
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process 
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process 
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, 
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced 
members of your management team, or those management team members where you 
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and 
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time 
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow 
through on this commitment.  

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a 
meaningful one.  

It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0

Sally,

As a follow up to your call yesterday, attached please find a powerpoint 
point presentation that outlines the business continuity options we are 
outlining and trying to get some cost estimates on.  For the more localized 
problems, we are working with the infrastructure group to develop a crisis 
management reporting structure so that accurate information is reported and 
the right personnel are notified and deployed.  The latter effort, however, 
does little to mitigate the larger risk.

Hi Sally and Mike,

Talked to Lexi Elliott and she told me about you all having lunch with
Blake, Clay and Michelle the other day. I know that meant alot to them and
only solidified their desire to work for Enron. Thanks for taking time out
of your busy schedules to meet with them.

Just wanted to let you know that I am scheduled to meet with Lexi and
Shelly Jones on Wednesday, August 2nd at 11:00 a.m. We will then be going to
lunch. Would like for both of you to join us if possible. I will bringing
Brenda Peters, who is with OU Career Services, down with me. She wanted to
come down with me and see Enron and meet both Lexi and Shelly, especially
Lexi, since she is the new OU contact for Enron. Brenda wants to make sure
everything is on schedule for this Fall recruiting. Lexi will be coming to
OU in early August to tour the campus and I will introduce her to Tim Rasnic
(JC Penney Leadership Program Director) and Dean Evans along with other
Department Heads in the Price College of Business. That way she should feel
comfortable when Enron comes to campus in October. If you are available and
would like to join us why don't you either let me know or else have your
assistants contact Lexi and let her know. If you would like to suggest a
time and place to meet, please feel free to do so.

If you can't make lunch and need to visit with me about anything, let me
know and I will arrange my schedule to meet with you. I will be in Houston
that entire week making my rounds.

Hope your summers have been going well and have been able to spend time with
your families.

Look forward to hopefully having lunch on August 2nd.

Take care.

On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected Enron's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.

Welcome to Enron.  I'm glad that you made the decision to come here.  
Hopefully, that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of 
time!  Look for Kristin Albrecht and Leslie Reeves in power on 31.  They know 
more about our power business than almost anyone on the floor.  They both 
report to me.  Kristin heads risk management and Leslie leads operations.  
They can help you on any details about our power business.

I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what 
that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to 
schedule a photographer.  I will be in the office next week, Wednesday 
through Friday.  Then I will be on vacation the week of July 10th.  Let me 
know when the photographer will come, so that I will know what to wear!  
Thanks, and have a great long weekend.  --Sally

Hi Sally!

Thank you for your revisions.  They have been incorporated and the article is 
ready to go!  The Spring 2000 issue is the only one that did not have a 
profile.  I'm sorry that I didn't bring one of the other issues with me, but 
the Summer 2000 issue is set for distribution in July and it has several 
profiles.

Yes, we do need a photo of you for your article.  Do you have a current 
high-resolution photo, slide or negative that we could borrow?  Please let me 
know if we need to send a photographer over.  

I know that you will be going to Florida soon.  Have a great trip!
Thanks again for your timely return of the article.
Kathie Grabstald

Esther,

Sally would like to view these documents now - is this on an "S" drive?  If 
so, how does she access.

Attached is Bob Superty's summary of the impact on the late noms today.  We 
do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.  On those pipes where the nom type 
is "Intraday", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work 
through.  The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday 
morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms 
were late.  Overall, these pipelines worked well with us today.  
Let me know if you have any questions.  --Sally

There are five summer interns and six recent full-time hires from OU that I 
will invite to the cookout at my house on Sunday, July 30th.  I asked Jody's 
opinion on whether or not they would like to bring along a guest, and his 
answer was yes.  So I will invite all to bring a spouse/guest.  

I thought that I would also include Lexi Elliott, the recruiter from the 
Analyst Program that will be covering OU.  Have you decided on the make-up of 
the recruiting team at OU in the fall?  If so, this might be a good event in 
which to include them as well.  I left you a voice mail message about James 
Scribner as a potential good member of the team.  Let me know your thoughts 
and I can include anyone else that you would like.  

I plan to get invitations out to everyone by July 7.  

Since receiving your e:mail message last Monday on your needs in power, I 
have spent three (!!!) full days in PRC meetings since then.  I have shared 
your needs with both Todd Hall and Kristin Albrecht (my power business 
controller here in Houston) and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be 
of help.  Sorry that I keep missing your calls.  I will be meeting with 
Fernley, but I will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow.  

It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I 
will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an 
on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my 
idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this 
week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.  

Bruce,

Just a reminder, this Wednesday (Dec 13) is the Associate PRC meeting in 
which Sally will be representing Cheryl Ingstad.  She really needs your input 
in order to properly represent Cheryl.  Please email information to her ASAP 
or call Sally with information Tuesday between 9:00 - 9:30 AM (3:00 - 3:30 PM 
London time).

Thanks for your assistance,
Patti x39106

I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris  
County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case.  
The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference 
call may not work.  I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way 
in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time.  

Let's book Friday, July 21 for this lunch.  I will work on further details.  
Thanks, Sharron. 

Thanks for the input.  It is just in time -- I attend Rick Causey's cross 
functional PRC for Directors and above tomorrow.  

I think that we have lunch coming up on the calendar on July 6.  I look 
forward to catching up then.  --Sally 

I would like to invite you as University of Oklahoma summer interns to join 
me for lunch on Friday, June 30.   I have made reservations for 11:45 am at 
Nino's on West Dallas.   I hope that you will be able to attend and can meet 
me in the Enron lobby at 11:30.  We will provide transporation to and from 
lunch.  Please call me at x35926 as soon as possible to let me know if you 
can attend. 

Mike McConnell, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks, 
will join us for lunch.  Many of you may have met Mike, a fellow OU grad.  He 
will serve as the Executive Lead for our continuing recruiting efforts at 
OU.  

Two other Enron employees will join us for lunch.  James Scribner, a Senior 
Director in ENA Energy Operations, recently joined Enron after seven plus 
years with a Fortune 500 company in Edmond, Oklahoma.  James will be helping 
us with our OU recruiting efforts.  Lexi Elliott, a new recruiter with 
Enron's Associates and Analysts Program, will be coordinating Enron's 
recruiting efforts in the future at OU.    

Thanks for the update.  I want to send her some flowers at the house.  Can 
you let Patti know if she is headed home on Friday?  Thanks.  --Sally 

   
	
	

GOOD NEWS!!!!!!!

Mary Solmonson had surgery this morning at Hermann Hospital;  her surgery 
went well.    It took about 2 hrs., 20 mins.    She's now in recovery and 
coming along nicely.

She will probably be able to go home tomorrow (Friday).

Will keep you posted.

I just wanted to drop all of you a note  . . .

I have an outstanding opportunity to head up Reliant's MBA Program.  I will 
begin my employment with Reliant the first week in July.  As soon as I am up 
and running, I will forward my phone number and email address.  I have 
enjoyed working with all of you! 

Ginger

UGH!!  I am happy for you, but know that Enron will be losing as you leave.  
I am pleased that the opportunity at Reliant is an exciting one for you, and 
I know that you will do a great job.  It has been fun to work with you, 
Ginger, and I too will miss that.  Best of luck to you!  --Sally

I know that Amanda will enjoy seeing you next week.  Thanks for making some 
time for her.  Let's definitely schedule a return trip for the two of you 
with some golf/cart time!

Hi, Sal.  Thanks for your message the other night.  We enjoyed seeing
everyone and had fun playing with Tyler and Amanda.  (I still get scared
when the lights are out - "I see dead people" . . . )  We'll definitely have
to do the golf next time.   I like the idea of riding around in the cart!
Mom told me Amanda is coming next week, so we'll do something on one of the
nights next week.  Have a good day!  love, c.

Looks as if this date will work for Mike McConnell and his wife, too.  I 
thought that I might also invite Ted Jacobs if he plans to be in  Houston 
that weekend.  Do you have an e:mail address for him?  Thanks.  

   
	
	

The 30th of July works great for me.  The interns should still be around and 
it would be a great way to end the summer.  I will put
a list together of recent graduates and send that to you.  I will also 
contact Shelly Jones and get a list of those starting in July.  I think 
it would be a good idea to include  friends/dates.  There are not that many 
of us Sooners here and we have met  most of our friends 
at Enron.  Let me know of anything else I can do.

Thanks Again,
Jody   

Thanks for the response.  I will look for your list so that I can send out 
invitations.  --Sally

Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training 
provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is 
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for 
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away 
from the desk is not very workable either.  

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to 
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be 
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.    
Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this 
decision?  Thanks.  --Sally 

Tim O'Rourke@ENRON

Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

I think that it is a great idea to compare recommendations for promotions.  
Our meeting will take place on December 8th, so we can be ready to discuss 
promotion recommendations as early as Monday, December 11.  When would be a 
good time for you?  

The invitation to attend our December 8th meeting still stands.  I know that 
it is along way to come for a single meeting (although it will most likely be 
a fully day), but if there are other things that you could accomplish while 
here, it could be worth it.  --Sally

This is great but you are right in that we probably do not have time to cross 
calibrate for the full global population of Risk Ops - perhaps next year. 
Also, from discussions with Fernley the higher grades will form part of Rick 
Causey's PRC ranking process - so we are left with lower risk post that ( 
Fernley said he would forward his note to Rick to yourself ).

My remaining concern is that any promotions, particularly in the risk group, 
which are not matched across Houston/London or indeed between EGM London and 
EEL London may create people risk. Can I suggest we compare promotions from 
senior specialist ( up to manager ) upwards ?

Hope everything is going well

Mike

   

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.

I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about 
checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) 
which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?

Enjoy the time off!  Just let us know when that week comes who your in charge 
person will be.  --Sally 

   

I would like to request vacation the week of July 17 - July 21.

Thanks,
Mike

Thanks for the offer.  I will take you up on it.  Can you get a list of 
recent OU grads hired at Enron?  I have the list of summer interns from OU.  
I thought that I would invite both full time and summer interns to the 
cookout.  

I am looking at Sunday, July 30th as possibly the best date -- probably 
starting about 5:00 in the afternoon.  How does that date work for you?  I 
assume that summer interns will still be with us then.  

What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you?  David will of course 
be there, and Mike McConnell and his wife will be there if the date works for 
them.  We can make this work either way.   Do you think that people would 
prefer to bring someone along, or simply attend solo.  I will take your 
suggestion on this one.  

After you get me the list of OU full timers, I will combine it with the list 
that I have of summer interns and we can make sure that it looks complete.  

Thanks for the help.  --Sally 

   
	
	

Sally,

I had talked to Ted and he mentioned the cookout you were planning for the OU 
group this summer.  Please let me help with any of the logistics, 
set-up, and clean up.  I know these things require a great deal of effort, 
especially when you welcome people to your personal residence.  I want to,
and insist on helping in whatever way I can.  I am really grateful for what 
you have done for the University of Oklahoma and I am also aware of
the great sacrifices you make for Enron.  If possible, we might schedule a 
lunch to discuss the specifics.  I would also be grateful if we could discuss
my most recent opportunity at Enron,  Texas Risk.  I realize the there is a 
great deal I can gain from this move and I would appreciate any insight on how
to obtain the most from this experience.

Thanks
Jody

Bob is a good, solid player.  He won't change the world, but he is diligent 
about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am 
very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His 
wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we 
jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order 
to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able 
to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a 
caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment 
to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and 
predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will 
personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he 
ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.  

Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what 
impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be 
better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL 
transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that 
they are not long on people.  I assume that Danny is following up with 
Brent.  --Sally 

	Barry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS

What do you think of him?

Danny suggested him. I here he has some 'issues'.

I'm neither plus or negative - just fact finding.

B.

I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on 
the MG aquisition and assimilation.  Would you please include me on that 
distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that 
Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the 
aquisition is completed.  However, in my role over Global Risk Management 
Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of 
operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  Brent Price, who reports 
to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping 
me updated on progress to date.  His return soon to Houston, however, will 
create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to 
fill.  

Thanks in advance to your attention to this.  

They all made me laugh out loud.  I am glad that they all were able to get 
up!  Thanks.  

I thought my sisters might appreciate these.  My favorite is the Bronze;
what's yours?   -the youngest

 - Gold.mpg
 - Silver.mpg
 - Bronze.mpg

I am not close enough to know Bob's exact role within the group to know the 
impact of the prospect of losing him.  I am forwarding this to Brent to get 
his assessment of the impact.  I do know that the number of deals that we do 
currently has skyrocketed with EOL, so I feel sure that the group is 
stretched right now.  Again, though, Brent would best be able to address 
this.  As you are probably aware, I personnally made the commitment to Bob 
several years ago to help in managing his workload so that he is available as 
needed at home for his wife.  For Bob's sake, I would want to make sure that 
he is in a situation where that is understood and appreciated.  

Thank you for contacting me first before going to Bob.  --Sally

This reporting tool looks very useful.  I am glad to know that you are 
managing with this on a regular basis.  Do we have a well-defined follow-up 
process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon?  This is a 
great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations.  It would 
be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this.  
Have you shared this with other groups within Energy Operations that are 
doing confirmations?  I would include Global Products as well.  --Sally

I will be out of the office after noon on Friday, June 9, headed to the hill 
country to pick up one of my daughters from camp.  I will not attend the 
Friday afternoon meeting.  You will be able to reach me on my cell phone, 
713-417-1591, as needed during the afternoon.    

Approved.  Please process.

I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a 
cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday, 
December 1.  She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by 
Thursday.  If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they 
also have data in to Sally by Thursday.

Thanks for your help,

Hi, Mike.  It is almost 2 pm Houston time as I am reading your message, so my 
hope is that you have already headed home today.  I would love to visit with 
you.  Would it work for us to talk at 9 am (3 pm London time) on Friday?   
Another good time for us to talk my be during my commute into the office.  I 
would expect to be in my car from about 7:00 to 8:00 am (Houston time) 
tomorrow.  My car phone number is 713-417-1591.  A few weeks ago I put 
together a list of key individuals for you to meet when you do come to 
Houston.  Once you have scheduled a trip, my offer still stands to set up 
these meetings for you.  It may be easier for my assistant to coordate these 
things in Houston than for you assistant to attempt that from London, given 
the time difference.  

I will look forward to speaking with you.  I understand that your value in 
the office is already felt.  --Sally

I feel I already know you having had the benefit of sitting next to Brent for 
the last few months- but I realise I have been impolite in not organising a 
call just to introduce myself and arrange dates for a visit to Houston.

Additionally Brent, Shona and I have spent some excellent time on the subject 
of Internal Control Enivronment / Operational Risk / Doorstep and I wanted to 
agree potential next steps with you.
Do you have anytime today / tomorrow ?

Mike

Thanks for the info on your trip.  Have a great time -- I will be anxious to 
hear about the presentation in Natchez.  Love, Sally

I meant to send this to you.  --Sally 

Thanks for confirming Mark's participation.  Mary Solmonson, one of my direct 
reports, will be sending information to your attention on the following:

Specifics on location of meeting at Rice Hotel 
Attendee list (names, titles, operating companies) 
Brief background on Mary Solmonson's Global Database Management Group
Suggested  talking points for Mark's talk
Agenda for the meeting

We will be sure to get this informaiton to you by Friday of this week, so 
that you can provide Mark with a copy when he is in the London office on 
Monday.

Just to confirm that Mark Frevert has blocked out 9am-10am on Friday, 16th 
June for the internal conference you are arranging.  He said that you will be 
sending over further details by the end of this week, would you mind sending 
them to me so that I can pull them off for his return on Monday?

Thank you

We will look forward to seeing you on the 17th.  Glad we could work out a 
date.  

HI, Sal.  You ARE correct:  we would be coming the weekend of the 17th/18th.
We'll leave Austin noonish on Saturday (I have a rowing lesson Saturday
morning!) and probably leave Houston mid-afternoon on Sunday.  Glad it still
works for you.   We'll look forward to seeing you guys and the new digs.
Love, C. 

I left a voice mail message for Dave Delainey this morning asking for 
clarification around the LNG business.  As soon as I hear back from him I 
will let you know, and then based on that info we can decide on best next 
steps.  

Brent A Price

The only conversation I have had with Jeff regarding this topic was when I 
was in Houston and he had inquired as to when I was returning, stating that 
he was going to need some help in integrating another business within Gas 
Trading (and alluded to the possibility of it being Liquids related).  My 
thoughts are that it would need to be supported out of my group since it is 
going to roll up to Jeff.  Do you want me to set up a conference call with 
you, Scott Earnest and myself to discuss?  Subsequent to that we should 
probably have a conference call with Jeff to get specifics.  Let me know what 
I need to do on this.

Brent

   

Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had 
earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that 
he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.  
(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably 
what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will 
assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  

Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely 
over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this 
business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with 
Jeff on this?   

I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did 
four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.   I completed 
the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted 
those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to 
commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he 
suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in 
Energy Operations.  

Analysts

Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams

Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my 
operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add 
more  strength to this group

Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to 
trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and Enron's risk 
books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns 
Enron and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to 
a trading  role, if appropriate

Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work 
experience and fit)

Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two 
of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a 
direct hire

Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could 
be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience

Associates

Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group

Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who 
suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from  
Energy Operations interviewed him or her) 

Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not 
want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk 
or operations

Let me know about next steps in this process.  I would be glad to talk about 
any of this in more depth.  

I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.  First, who is Doug Imrie?  Does he 
have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to 
coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able 
to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump 
start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort 
should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing 
people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and 
effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading 
operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be 
the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in 
operations on a daily basis.  

Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in 
with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York 
offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is 
assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.  

Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that 
includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been 
involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily 
operational experience?  I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as 
well.  

Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had 
earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that 
he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.  
(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably 
what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will 
assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  

Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely 
over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this 
business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with 
Jeff on this?   

I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP.  Kristin 
certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half 
of the year.  I would like to see her develop a broader view across the 
organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and 
sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP.  I guess 
that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are 
other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would 
make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack.  --Sally

thanks

as we discussed - my feeling is to not promote to VP this time - are you cool 
with that still? - given that we have no other outstanding candidates for VP 
in her 'peer group'

We willl consider that a rain check.  Just let know in a cooler month when 
you will be around and I know that David will make his schedule work to 
play.  

Separately, I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in 
Calgary the last time.  If you have a few minutes amidst the SAP training 
while you are in Houston, I would love to visit face to face to hear from 
your perspective how your interactions with my Houston operations group are 
going and to see you have any suggestions on areas of improvement.  Just give 
me a call at x35926.  --Sally 

Laura E Scott
06/05/2000 03:24 PM
Sally, it is going to be difficult for me to golf this trip.  I have 5 days 
of SAP training that I can't quite figure out how I could reschedule.  Peggy 
and I are talking about coming back in the fall so may be when we firm up our 
plans we'll call you and see if your husband is available then.  Thanks so 
much for the invitation.  If we weren't 3 weeks away from going live on both 
SAP and Unify-Financial I would have moved heaven and earth to make it 
happen!!

We have lunch scheduled for June 22, according to my calendar.  I am looking 
forward to it.  --Sally 

   

Thanks for the note.   I'd love to do lunch when you have the time.  It will 
help me in serving Energy Ops.

That meeting was about my 13th of the day that began at 7:30, and that was 
day three of the week with that kind of scheduling.  I apologize if I seemed 
impatient in the meeting.  I know that you are working for the best interests 
of Energy Operations and  Enron.  By the end of the day I was probably 
looking for crisp, clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend 
itself well to that.  

Why don't we set up a lunch so that you and I can have the opportunity to 
talk separate from immediate issues at hand?  I will have Patti get a date on 
the calendar.  --Sally 

   

Dear Sally, 
I should have and I could have made a better job of trying to sell my idea at 
yesterday's meeting.   I'll be the first one to admit that all of my 
suggestions are not always the best alternative but,   I hope that you 
believe that I do have your best interests and Enron's best interests in mind 
every time that I make a suggestion.   
I hope to earn your trust as we continue to work together.
Sincerely, hgm 

I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.  I had put her on the list 
of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.  He had asked about 
someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that 
she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.  I 
don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that 
conference call.  What is she going to do for you in gas?  We may be 
hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has 
been as involved with EOL.  --Sally

I didn't know about this one.  I'm going to follow up with Brent on this one 
and I will get back to you in a day or so.  We'll save the Scott Mills 
discussion for a later date!

of the building again sometime.  --Sally

My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is 
sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the 
ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, 
our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the 
common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit 
aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial 
reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has 
harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an 
effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can 
help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project,  
Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is 
currently under development for delivery later this quarter.  

We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide 
who will attend the working session next week.  Please let me know if you are 
interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.  

Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity.  

Please pring attached presentation for me in color.  Thanks.

Just wanted to pass along a copy of the update presentation that was done 
last week in London.

It highlights achievements to date, key next steps, and the current timetable.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kevin

I did walk out of the room with the two booklets (employee profiles and 
pre-review rankings) that had been distributed, and I left a message with 
Sheila Knudsen as soon as I got back to my office on Wednesday night to let 
her know.  They were delivered to Sheila on Thursday morning.  Can you verify 
that Sheila received those from me?  Thanks.  --Sally 

Kimberly Rizzi

Hi everyone!

We asked at the meeting on Wednesday for all profile books to be left on the 
table so that they did not get outside the meeting.  At the end, we collected 
them back and 4 books seem to be missing.  

If you mistakenly took a profile book from the meeting please return it to me 
at EB1534 as soon as possible.  

FYI - none of the ratings books were missing so thanks!

Kim

Happy anniversary!  I hope to leave the office soon and am planning to call 
you to wish you that over the phone on my way home.  

Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting 
Amanda ready for camp.  There was still a good bit of painting going on this 
week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.  

We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is 
having fun.  Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.  Has 
some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.  

I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.  As we 
discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back 
home next weekend.  So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a 
total for gifts for both girls.  

Love, Sally

Dear Sally,  Hope you are about finish up at the office and are headed home
soon.  I am eager to hear how things are going at your house.  Do you have
most everything back in place or were you too busy getting Amanda ready.

Is Amanda having a good time again this year?  I have written her several
times.

I would like very much to know what I owe you for Meagan and Amanda's
birthday presents, so If you have time this week-end perhaps you can give me
a call.  Give that Tyler a big hug for us.

Love,

Mom

I have completed preliminary rankings on the attached sheet.  You had 
included my name, and I did not put in a preliminary rank.  Brent Price's 
name is missing.  I would put him in the Excellent category at this time.  
Let me know if you need anything else.  It is possible that I may change a 
few of the preliminary rankings as I get more information from my direct 
reports who supervise certain directors.   I will let you know.  --Sally

preliminary rankings of your people.  If you have any questions please let me 
know.

Please assign preliminary ratings and return the spreadsheet to me by close 
of business Wednesday, November 29th.

Thanks,
Kim

Scott's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is 
in the London office now is Brent Price.  I looked up Scott's name on our 
Enron People Finder, and it would appear that he is in the IT department.  I 
assume that he is someone who is on assignment in the UK, so I would suggest 
that you contact Beth Perlman in Houston who leads IT for ENA or talk with 
Mark Pickering in IT in London.  My role in Houston is over the trading 
operations groups, but does not include IT.  I wish that I could answer your 
specific question for you, but I think that referring you to IT will get you 
the answer that you need.

Hi Sally

I'm very sorry to bother you, but can you please connect me with a member of 
your team who can help me with a query on Scott Lytle's cost centre.

The cost centre you provided to Tara (Project Q - 800001745) is not accepted 
by our UK SAP system, so we need another code asap as he has already started 
work here.

Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks and apologies again for bothering you with such a trivial query.

Per your request during our meeting this morning, attached is the spreadsheet 
with the changes we discussed.  Bryce, Lisa and myself will continue to work 
on the statistic updates (i.e. number of counterparties, responsible party, 
etc.) as we discussed.  If you have any questions, please let us know.

My new employee who will be working with me on global standards for

yesterday.  Her name is Shona Wilson, and I do not know her extension.  She 
was in orientation yesterday, and I will be meeting with her today from 9:30 
to 10:30 to discuss her initial assignments, of which working with India is 
one.   I will have her contact you later today.  Although she is new to 
Enron, she has had extensive experience with Price Waterhouse Coopers in 
internal audit, controls and process redesign for trading firms, both in the 
US and in Europe.  She will work with other seasoned professionals on my team 
to set up the infrastructure that is needed in India.   --Sally

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 

Thanks,
Wanda Curry
  

 

 

Wanda,

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

Thanks and Regards.

I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be 
good for to consider hiring.  Here is her response.  Tony Vasut had called 
her and asked for this list as well.  Do you have him keyed in on our blitz 
effort for hiring of risk personnel?  Or is he working on some other 
initiative?  I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail 
yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.  --Sally 
	
	

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to Enron.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

FYI - I believe that Shona will prove to be a great asset to Enron.  We are 
following up on her leads for talent.  --Sally 
	
	

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to Enron.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try!

I just spoke with Elyse Kalmans, my boss, and she wanted me to be sure that 
you have the UT MBA Excellence Awards dinner on your calendar. It is 
scheduled for September 7th at Jeffries (in the Josephine House) at 7 p.m. in 
Austin, TX. Though she will contact you with additional details after she 
returns in August from maternity leave, she wanted me to be sure to inform 
you of the date.

Hi Ted,

It's Patti.  An all day meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 31 - 
the day you and Sally were scheduled for lunch.  Any possibility of 
rescheduling to another day?  Sally is available Thursday, June 1.

Just let me know.

Thanks,

My new employee who will be working with me on global standards for 
operations for all trading/origination locations started with Enron 
yesterday.  Her name is Shona Wilson, and I do not know her extension.  She 
was in orientation yesterday, and I will be meeting with her today from 9:30 
to 10:30 to discuss her initial assignments, of which working with India is 
one.   I will have her contact you later today.  Although she is new to 
Enron, she has had extensive experience with Price Waterhouse Coopers in 
internal audit, controls and process redesign for trading firms, both in the 
US and in Europe.  She will work with other seasoned professionals on my team 
to set up the infrastructure that is needed in India.   --Sally 

Wanda/Sally,

Can I talk to the person sometime today or tomorrow?. Please provide me with 
the name and tel no. Thanks and Regards.

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 

Thanks,
Wanda Curry
  

 

 

Wanda,

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

Thanks and Regards.

I will be out of the office for one vacation day on Monday, May 22.  My 
assistant, Patti Thompson, has home and cell phone numbers where I can be 
reached throughout the day, if needed.  

Primary operations contacts while I am out are as follows:

 DPR   Mike Moscoso   x35242

 MPR   David Maxwell   x36983

 Gas Operations  Susan Harrison   x33960

 Power Operations Leslie Reeves   x37962 

 Financial Products  Sheila Glover   x33210 

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, May 23.  

According to records from the Analysts Program, the following interns will be 
working within Energy Operations during the summer.  The assignment stated 
below is as reflected in the program's spreadsheet.  

Name   School   Start Date Assignment

Luna Carlson  University of Florida  July 5  ENA - Risk Reporting and Analysis

Joshua Koenig  University of Florida  May 22  Energy Operations - Gas 
Operations Management

Jolly Jose  University of Houston  June 5   Energy Operations - Gas 
Operations Management

Michael Taylor  LSU    May 22  Central Desk Logistics 

Daniel Graham  Morehouse   May 15  ENA - Financial Settlements

Angelique Woods University of Texas  May 22  ENA - Risk Management

First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be 
reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.  Hopefully 
none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made 
for desk, phone and computers for all.  

Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them 
to Enron.  

Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief 
meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be 
working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this 
summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you.     

FYI  -- Let me know who Angelic will report to and what she will be doing.  
Thanks.

THANK YOU .... to those of you who attended the summer analyst info session.  
For those of you who couldn't attend,  the information will be delivered to 
you via inter-office mail.  

As we discussed yesterday, our goal is to ensure a quality summer for all of 
our interns.  To continue in those efforts we encourage you to schedule a 
meeting with your intern during his/her first week to:
 explain group/department initiatives
establish roles/responsibilities and define performance expectations

ALSO, PLEASE NOTE:  interns starting on Monday, May 22 will be available to 
report directly to their supervisors following lunch.  Due to availability 
and limited space, PC training will take place later in the week.  Interns 
that start on June 5 will report to their supervisors that afternoon 
following PC training. 

Thank you again for your time and your support.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions.

Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.  I will be out on vacation on 
Monday.  Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I 
will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one 
of my daughters.  I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum 
meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.  I will get back in touch 
if the Tuesday lunch does open up.  Would Amita like to meet at another time 
during those days?  There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on 
Tuesday evening.  How does that work with Amita's schedule?  --Sally

Hi Sally

Amita from PCG - London will be visiting your offices next Monday - Wednesday 
and would like to meet with you for lunch.  Do you have any available time in 
these three days?

Many thanks,

I agree that discussing the numbers in person with AA would be the right way 
to handle this.  And, I am looking to Brent in managing the current 
reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting.  My 
expectation is that the vast majority of the $49MM variance will be explained 
and finalized by Monday at 11:00 am.  This finalization obviously involves 
both the gas operations group and gas accounting.  I will be on vacation on 
Monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but I have carved out time 
during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the 
reconciliation, as it is very important to me.  

--Sally 

   
	
	

Someone from Arthur Andersen called Troy today asking to see the details of 
our DPR to G\L entry for March accounting.  I instructed him to tell them 
that we would be happy to set up a meeting for later next week to sit down 
with them and OA to discuss the process, the April numbers and the 
reconciliation of those numbers.  As I believe you all know, the entry that 
we had to book in March was close to $49 million and the April entry was 
closer to $25 million.  They know how the process works and should understand 
that the variances coming from the first several months are primarily timing, 
but experience tells me that they will over react if we simply turn over the 
analysis showing $49 as they have requested.  In light of the current 
reconciliation effort do you think we will be able to talk to them about the 
older items ( I would suggest only discussing things that fall into the 1999 
and prior category) late next week?

Let me know your thoughts.

Mary,

Sally says this is okay.

Mary Gosnell has been performing well in her new role as Manager.  I would 
like to offer Mary some coaching sessions with Team Leadership to develop her 
presence and language skills when dealing with management personnel.  Any 
problems with that ?

Sounds as if you will have a full day on Monday.  I am glad that you are 
eager to get together to kick off your role -- we will have to save that for 
Tuesday, however.  I am taking the day off on Monday to be with my parents 
who will be in from Austin for one of my daughter's piano recital.  9:30 to 
10:30 on Tuesday would be a great time for us to get together.  There are two 
other meetings that day that I would like to have you attend with me.  One is 
a weekly Risk Forum luncheon from 11:30 to 1:00 and the other is a meeting at 
3:00 on trading operations for Tokyo.  I will give the details on location 
and list of attendees when you and I meet on Tuesday morning.  

Enjoy your next few days.  I hope that orientation is helpful on Monday.  
Check with my assistant, Patti Thompson, on where you will be sitting.   I 
look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.  --Sally 

Dear Sally,

I'm looking forward to start working on the 22nd.  I've arranged to have the
first day orientation as well as PC training on this date, which will last
until about 4:30.

I'm putting together some thoughts on how to best "kick off" my roles and
responsibilities and was wondering if you would be able to meet at 4:30 on
the 22nd to go over this.

I'm available through tomorrow at 713 356 4086 and the rest of the week at
713 628 7570.

Best regards,

Shona

Ignore this first reply.  I am scheduled for too many PRC meetings, so I had 
my dates confused.  I will get you pre-rankings before the 29th.  You have 
left Brent Price off of the list, a VP who reports to me.  Is Rick Causey 
planning to pre-rank Brent, or does he want me to handle that?  Do your 
records not show that Brent reports to me?  I approved his reviewers in the 
PEP system.  --Sally 

   

The Energy Operations PRC meeting will be held on December 8th.  At that 
time, I will have information for you to load for Rick's PRC meeting on the 
12th.  I would prefer to give you that information on the 8th, rather than 
guessing at a ranking now or taking the time of my direct reports to go 
through this process before our meeting on December 8th.   They are all busy 
with the details of reviewing over 400 people in preparation for our December 
8th meeting.  Please let me know if you can make this schedule work for you.  
Thanks.

Sally,

Attached is a spreadsheet with pull down boxes allowing you to assign 
preliminary rankings of your people.  If you have any questions please let me 
know.

Please assign preliminary ratings and return the spreadsheet to me by close 
of business Wednesday, November 29th.

Thanks,

Tara,

Sally says Todd's London project is under Barry Pearce (related to 
Continental Power) - Barry would need to designate London RC (or James New in 
his absence, since Barry is in Houston).

Regarding the "extra" housing costs, this would need to be charged to Todd's 
RC in Houston, which is #2182.

Please let me know if you require additional information.

Hi, Sally

We may have discussed this already, but I think I have forgotten the answer, 
sorry!!

Which RC in London is taking most of Todd's costs? I have some urgent bills 
to pay and need an RC.

thanks!

By the way, are you coming to London?

Approved.  Please process.

Thanks for the update and attachment.  It will be great to have you back here 
in Houston.  I have heard lots of good things about your assignment there, 
however, so I know that the London group will miss your presence.  

I will try to call you Wednesday morning on my way into the office.  

I.  

Sally has changed the time of her Thursday morning meeting to 8:30 - 10:30 AM 
(previously scheduled 8:00 - 10:00 AM).  Please let me know if you can't make 
this new time.  Topic for meeting:  information from her ENA Executive 
Offsite and also a brainstorming session.

Thanks for the reminders.  Hopefully, this will take care of this.

As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the 
country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison

Fernley,

Sally asked me to forward this to you to outline what she is doing with 
Arthur Anderson to get ready for SAP, specifically, Global Products.

Patti

Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.  I look forward 
to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management 
operations initiatives.  

I talk with Brent Price several times a week.  I know that Fernley has 
appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his 
involvement to be beneficial as well.  We are almost at the half way mark on 
his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary 
to get your input on his role to date.  

I have been summoned for jury duty onTuesday, November 28 at 8:00 am.  While 
wanting to fulfill my civic duty, I am also hoping to be an unlikely juror 
this time around so that I can be back in the office sometime on Tuesday.  I 
will call in and let Patti know my status.    

Congratulations on your added role of Chairman and CEO of ENA.  I didn't 
realize that when I said hello in the elevator last week that we would be 
seeing more of you in Houston.  I look forward to working with you when you 
arrive.  

Congratulations on your new role as Chief Strategy Officer.    Your 
leadership in ENA was appreciated and I will miss your active participation 
in ENA's business.  However, I hope that we will have opportunities to work 
together in the future.  --Sally 

This makes great sense - glad to have you as a true ENA resource. 

Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday.  Let me know how I 
can best support you as you make the changes that you outlined.  I was 
impressed with my brief glimpse of Jeff at yesterday's 5:30 meeting.  --Sally

Guys, in response to the offsite, Beth Perleman is now a dedicated ENA 
resource on the IT side of the business.  She will be joining the ENA 
Management Team of which you are all a part.  She will participate in the 
Friday Management Meeting to address IT issues and opportunities. On Friday 
May 18th, Beth will go over her management team and her available resources.  
At every Friday meeting, she will present the current project queue (with 
associated cost/capital budget and sponser) and the Management Team will set 
priorities and necessary incremental resources.  

Regards
Delainey

Well done!  Beth will be a great resource.  --Sally

I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear 
Julie Andrews speak.   Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school 
drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as 
our daughters.  So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High 
School with Meagan.  

Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner.  I hope that all of you enjoy the 
evening.  

The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next 
Tuesday, May 16.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot 
for dinner.   That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be 
my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture.  I can't think of a better 
idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright, 
motivated women!     I will look forward to introducing her to those of you 
whom she has not yet met.  

I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter 
of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.  I have not talked 
directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this

I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's 
name was "in play", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with 
Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.  At an ENA offsite meeting on 
Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see 
if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead.  
Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the 
transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.  He had 
some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer 
months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would 
like.  His reaction was not "never", but instead was "not now".  He and 
Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.  Let's 
discuss.  --Sally 

Barry Pearce
05/08/2000 11:14 AM
I heard Kristen was the topic of a discussion between Jim and Presto - 
re:timing.

Kristen was going to meet with you.

Jim wants real soon - Presto wants never - you know - the regular story.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.  Then Meagan 
leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.  If we decide 
to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or 
July 10.  After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school 
start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.  Looks as if 
we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer, 
unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at 
camp.  Let me know when you want to talk dates.  

Sally - Great!  THanks for the reply.  I'm glad those are the earrings.
Yes, I hope things start getting better for M & D.   I do want to come for a
visit.   Chris and I haven't even had a chance to talk about it.  We will do
that so you and I can talk dates.    Since we'll probably get to see Amanda
while she's here (and Meagan's pretty booked anyway) , I wonder if it might
be fun to visit you guys when it's just you and Tyler - that way we'll get
lots of time with you guys and Mr. T?      -Cara

He has been focused on Sitara for a long time.  He reports to Scott Mills, 
who is the user lead for the project.  I am copying Scott on this message, as 
his Sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the 
horizon and how critical Tom's involvement is to those deliverables.  I 
suggest that we involve Scott in these discussions.  --Sally 

Louise Kitchen
05/08/2000 10:09 AM
We were thinking Tom would be a great fit for the EnronOnline development job 
we are currently.  Mark Dilworth is going to approach him - if OK with you.
We think he wants a change (we think he has been on Sitara 3 years).

Louise

You have the right earrings -- they are tiny!  But that's what she would 
like.  She will be really pleased.  She loves her silver ones, but they are 
not great for everyday wear -- gold is better for her ears.  

Sounds as if your weekend was fun.  Ours was nice --errands and stuff on 
Saturday and the Enron picnic at Astroworld on Sunday.  Otherwise, just 
camping out in the mess at our house.  

I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs. psychiatrist.  
Sounds as if from her ER buddy at the Heart Hospital that she has decided 
that they need both -- one for counseling and one for meds.  I believe that 
she and Dad will each see a counselor type on Tuesday this week.  I hope that 
they will begin to find some relief.  Sounds as if they are really having a 
hard time - at least Mom.  

We would still like for you to come visit.  Let's talk dates when you're 
ready.  --Sally 

HI, Sal.  Well, I guess Meagan told you that I went ahead and called her
since I was headed up to James Avery - and realized time is running out!
I think I found the earrings she wants, but I wanted to make sure.  They are
really TINY gold studs, in the shape of very gold hearts.   Does that sound
right?  (She said she has silver ones just like them but wants gold.)   If
those are the ones, I'll have those sent to her.

Hope you had a good weekend.  We had a social one - friends over for drinks
on Friday (we have christened the bucket, by the way!); dinner party on
Saturday; babtism/brunch on Sunday . . . I pulled up Enron's web site the
other day and printed out an article about the company just for fun -
thought I should learn more about it.   Interesting stuff.    Love, C. 

FYI - Let's talk.  I am already booked for Tuesday AM - could you attend and 
would you want to?  Let's talk before getting back to Margaret.  --Sally

FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  We 
have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may 
want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then 
returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from 
that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out 
of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally 

Sally,

I need Tom over here ASAP. The flat was given to Todd on the understanding 
that Tom would have it at the start of May. Its now been extended to 18th 
May. I don't wan't to postpone Tom's transfer any longer. Please can you give 
me assurance that Todd will vacate by his newdate of the 18th May.

Thanks
MRP

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

   

Tom,

I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is in 
the apartment. Please let me know what is going on - this is the first I 
heard, and I think its a bit late considering I thought you'd be here today 
!!!!

I understand that Ashley Worthing has been hired by Enron to start work this 
summer.  I think that she is graduating from Texas A&M.  She is my cousin's 
daughter, so I am just curious whether or not she is coming in as an 
analyst.  Please let me know if that is the case.  Thanks. 

I gave a copy of this document to Wes Colwell immediately following last 
week's meeting with a note that he needed to respond to you.  He is the most 
appropriate respondent from ENA.  --Sally

At the Financial Council meeting last Thursday, we distributed a write-up 
entitled "Workshops".  In it we discussed the work performed to date, the 
results, and three options for proceeding.

Could you please take a look at the document (it's a very quick read), call 
me if you need more information, and then "vote" for which option you would 
prefer?  I would appreciate your response by this Friday.  if you don't vote, 
then you will get what the majority votes for.  If there is significant 
division in the votes, we can discuss a "tailored" approach at the next 
Financial Council meeting.

We are trying to do what YOU want; we just need you to tell us which approach 
you prefer.  Thanks! 

Did you mean to have an attachment to this e:mail ?  There was not one 
attached.

Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town.  
Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a 
time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date 
confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally 

Yes, it's good to have my hubby back!   Am going to Wharton tomorrow to meet
with Trav - as far as we can tell, the Wharton County Tennis Assoc. is the
oldest in the state and I'm going to write an article about them.  Hope all
is well.  Hello to all!   Love, Cara

Glad you sent a note - as crazy as life is at our house right now, I did not 
get the message from Tammy.  Lots of catch up in the office last week, which 
will continue this week.  I think that Chris is home by now, and I am sure 
that you and Erica are glad to have the additional company.  We are starting 
to talk birthday with Meagan now.  I will get back with you in a couple of 
days after Meg and I have gone through the JA catalogue.  Thanks for asking.  
--Sally 

Hi, Sal.   Just checking in with you.  I called Friday and talked with
Tammy; I wasn't sure if you'd get the message.  Have you had a chance to
comb through the James Avery catalogue (or think of any other ideas?) for
Meagan's birthday?   Hope you're well.   E-mail back when you can!   Love,
C. 

Hi Clare,

How about:

Tuesday, May 9th 1:30-2:30 PM or 3:00-4:00 PM

Sally has tentative plans to go to Calgary May 10-12, so Tuesday is best for 
her.  If neither of these time slots work, just let me know and I can move 
things around to accommodate James.

See ya,

Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since 
Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him 
in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain 
a mention of the transition:

Example:

 Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be 
transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce 
assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will 
report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  

I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out 
of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading 
operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that 
is clarified.  

Barbara,

Will this be at 4:00 PM on Monday?  Sally has meeting w/ Louise Kitchen from 
3:30 to 4:30, so she will probably be 30 mins late to Jeff's meeting.

Patti

It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct 
reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet 
at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the 
day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little 
later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will 
have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure 
time.  --Sally 

   

Hi Sally
Hope you had a great Easter!
Are you okay with us leaving the office early on Wed May 3rd?
Sometimes it is hard for some to break for lunch and others can't do a dinner 
after work.  I thought mtg at 3pm would be inbetween.  And give everyone a 
chance to relax without thinking about coming back to work.
I wanted to check with you before I asked for RSVP's.
Thank you
Lynn

	

Hi Ladies,
If you don't know already, Patti Thompson (Sally's Assistant) is now an 
official Enron Employee!!!!  Yeah!!!!!  I couldn't be more pleased and would 
like to arrange a get together to welcome her to our group!  Plus, we haven't 
all gotten together for awhile!  Instead of having lunch or dinner, maybe we 
can meet in between.

 How about this? 
Little Papasito's (on Westhiemer and Kirby) or Tilah's (on West Dallas)
Wednesday, May 3rd
Meet at the restaurant at 3:00pm
There is one thing about this. . . .no returning to the office!
(It hasn't been decided whether to go to Papasito's or Tilah's, place your 
vote!)

I  would love to accommodate as many assistants as possible.  So if this 
conflicts with many of your schedules, we can be flexible on the date.
Please let me know what you think as soon as you can.  I'll keep everyone 
posted!
Lynn

We will look forward to seeing you in Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting on May 
9th at 8:30 in EB46C1.  I listened to your voice mail message --thanks for 
the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program.  

My dad was released from the hospital on Saturday, following what seemed like 
a very long ten day stay.  He lost a lot of weight while being fed only by IV 
for 8 of those days, so he is under orders to eat everything in sight!  
Hopefully, this most recent operation will result in overall better health 
for him going forward.  Thanks for asking.  --Sally

Thanks for your note.  Between meetings today, I will construct a loose job 
description and e:mail that to you later today.  I realized after you left 
that we did not talk about compensation.  It would help me in creating this 
role with our HR group if I knew ballpark figures on compensation.  We have a 
good comp team that can research that for me, but a short cut would be to 
know from you what you are currently making and what you would be looking 
for  in making a move.  Feel free to call me or respond via e:mail.  My

Be sure and let Barbara or I know if you have any

Theresa Brogan has been meeting with Kathleen Garcia Spicer under the 
TEAMLEADERSHIP Program.  Theresa and I are pleased with the progam.
I would like to request that Clara Carrington be added.  Clara is taking on 
many new responsibilites assuming the lead for the Rate & Currency Trading 
Desk and I think that this program would be of assistance in making that 
transition even more successful.

Okay?
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila,

I'm sorry I haven't responded to this before, but Sally has been out of the 
office with family illness & I haven't been able to check with her.  I will 
be out of the office until Tuesday, so if you need this information before 
then, please call Chantelle Villanueva at ext.36279 on Monday and she can 
check with Sally then.

Thanks,
Patti

Joe,

Sally is out of the office, but wanted me to forward the message that she had 
reviewed the draft that you put together regarding power trading and she 
doesn't have any comments.

Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our 
meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so 
it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  

Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became 
concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other 
supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily 
involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both 
recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting 
talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. 

I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would 
bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss 
them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and 
improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included 
the following:

 Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU

 Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  

 Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida

 Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of 
Florida

 Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU

 Carolyn Barrett  EBS    

 Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P 

Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:

One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an 
announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much 
materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be 
managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw 
that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and 
differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We 
feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program 
on campus. 

SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is 
impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an 
innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates 
and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in 
May.  

Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed 
senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or 
communication about the program.   We hear rumors of "tracks", but no facts 
or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some 
had not.  

Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support 
staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily 
focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.

Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many 
of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join 
with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that 
decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum 
without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  

MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team 
and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on 
campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top 
candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the 
focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and 
we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.  

Summary Concerns/Discussion Points:

I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane 
to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.  Below are my suggested seven 
appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.  I made the selections based on 
their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of 
male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current 
operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc.

I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today. 

Analyst  School  Current Rotation Rationale

Ilan Caplan  UT   CALME Structuring Both MSA and Commercial Analyst rotations

Erin Rice  Trinity   CALME Structuring Vocal; good to be part of the 
solution; female minority

Brian Hoskins  Vanderbilt  ENA Trading  I will trust Jeff Shankman on this one

Carrie Southard  Texas A&M  ENA - EOL  Current MSA rotation

Alejandro Veiga Rice   ESA - Venezula  Good ideas; diverse background

Courtney Votaw  Pepperdine  Corp. - PR  Adds interest to the mix with her 
rotation & background

Adrian Woolcock Rice   EES   Sounds mature; good ideas  

    

Can you coordinate the Scott Tholen's team to do this ASAP?  Thanks.  Keep me 
updated on when Fernley will have access.  Thanks.

if any revisions are required.  Thank you.

I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.  However, in my 
staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one 
of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for 
EOL access.  We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.  Susan 
needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager 
should  okay this as well.  --Sally

Weather:  The gross book balance of the Weather Risk book is smallest after 
the winter season (majority of trades roll off in March) and alot of business 
is executed during September.  Although September would probably be OK, it 
may be helpful it the review was moved to June/July.

Pulp, Paper and Lumber-:  Looks OK.

Although it is not ENA, I would recommend a review of EBS  Bandwidth Trading 
for the latter part of the year.  I'm not sure how this would get scheduled.

Please incorporate these changes into the 2000 plan.  Thanks.

We would love to see all three of you.  Sounds as if you might arrive on 
Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.  You can see 
the kitchen in progress!!  The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can 
make yourselves at home.  I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all 
be glad to see you.  

I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might 
change her plans.  I will try to catch her tonight.  

Just let me know on the $'s.  I can send that whenever you might need it.  
And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as 
you all get caught up on other things.  No rush.  

Love, Sally 

I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office.  
Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to 
transfer my call into voice mail.  They were good about answering your phone, 
however! 

I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.  If I miss 
you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.  I will be 
in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can 
easily step out to talk with you.  

Please incorporate the management contact changes per Sheila Glover for the 
2000 plan.  
	
	

Sally,
Equity and Debt Trading should be:
 Gary Hickerson instead of Jeff Kinneman (Jeff is the Debt Trading piece only)
 Include Beth Perlman/Jonathan Le
 As noted, Sheila Glover instead of John Norden
Rate & Currency Trading (change name from FX/IR Trading
 Include Beth Perlman/Jonathan Le
 As noted, remove John Norden

Thanks for the update.  I am glad that you and Fernley were able to get 
together.  

Let me know what you hear from Mark or Tim about their discussion.  When that 
is set, I will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as 
Scott Pleus devotes full time to EBS.  

Hope your weekend was a good one.  Have you seen Brent yet?  --Sally 

   
	
	

Sally,

I wanted to give you a quick update.

I met with Fernley last Friday and we had a good discussion.  He wanted to 
know my initial assessment of the project and a rough time-line.  I admire 
the fact that he took almost 30 minutes of his time to show his interest in 
this project and myself.  I told him that it would be prudent for me to 
return a month after implementation of the book splits.  This way I can 
ensure that the processes and tools are in place and used by both the traders 
and the support staff.  If Brent needs some assistance at that time, I could 
stay for a 2-week span and meet two needs on one trip.

I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk.  
When I asked Mark about the impact of the traders leaving, he said that they 
are probably trading even more.  Tim Norton is meeting with Mark today and 
assuming things go well, he could began training almost immediately.

I'll try to call you tomorrow,
Todd

Thanks for sending the announcement to me.  You will be a great asset to 
EBS.  And you will probably be working with some of our old Energy Operations 
staff members!  Stay in touch and I wish you the best in your new role.  
--Sally 

Thank you very much for sending out your nice note about my new position in 
EBS.  I greatly enjoyed working for you and hope that we can stay in touch in 
the future.  Thank you again.
     Best regards,

Please join me in congratulating Inja Chun on her new position with EBS.  
Inja has made numerous contributions to Enron's information technology, most 
recently helping to develop a new e-Commerce venture for Enron in Korea.  We 
would like to wish her success in her new endeavor where she will be working 
on the development of new systems for EBS and express our appreciation for 
her 5+ years of service in Enron Net Works.

Fall sounds good to me.  In talking with Sue today, she stated that Dr. Rao 
would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and 
that it will most likely be another week before he does so.  I asked her to 
contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow 
up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.  I will keep 
Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) 
updated on the timing of notifying the winners.  --Sally 

   

I will plan the event for the fall - I'll be back from maternity leave and we 
can get PR on campus for the event as well.  Thanks!  Elyse

Rick won't be back in the office until Monday but I am sure that this will be 
ok with him.  His schedule is really tight for the next month.

   
	
	

Sally and Rick:  I am fine with having the dinner in the fall if y'all are ok 
with that.  Actually, it will give us more flexibility to plan and get great 
attendance.  Please let me know your thoughts, and I will communicate 
directly with Sue White.

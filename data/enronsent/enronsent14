? <<Fw:  Spaghetti>> 

A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. Shortly 
after this started, she told him she was pregnant. Not 
wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a large 
sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the 
baby there. 

"But how will I let you know the baby is born?" she 
asked. 

He replied, "Just send me a postcard and write 
'spaghetti' on the back." 

Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money 
and flew to Italy. Six months went by and then one day 
the doctor's wife called him at the office and 
explained, "Dear, you received a very strange postcard 
in the mail today and I don't understand what it 
means." 

The doctor said, "Just wait until I get home and read 
it and I will explain it to you." 

Later that evening the doctor came home, read the 
postcard, fell to the floor with a heart attack - and 
died. 

So the wife picked up the cord and read, "Spaghetti, 
Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - two with sausage and 
meatballs, two without."

>>Someone else was sure to come along.  No!  "Ben,
honey, promise me

sliding, toward

girls of high

passenger side, was
>>dead, killed on impact.
>>The driver, however was still breathing.  She was
unconscious and

catalogued the
other

probable internal

>>But if help came soon, the girl would live.
>>A trucker had pulled up and was calling for help on
his cellular

>>Soon Barbara heard the ambulance sirens.

wounds.

as Barbara
>>walked back to her car a feeling of sadness
overwhelmed her,
especially
>>for the family of the girl who had died.  Their
lives would never be
the
>>same. Oh God, why do such things have to happen?
Slowly Barbara
opened
>>her
>>car
>>door.  What should she tell Benjamin?  He was
staring at the crash
>>site, his blue eyes huge.   "Mom," he whispered,
"did you see it?"
>>" See what,  Honey?" she asked.  "The angel, Mom!
He came down from
>>the sky while you were running to the car.
>>And he opened the door, and he took that girl out."
>>
>>Barbara's eyes filled with tears. "Which door, Ben?"
>>"The passenger side. He took the girl's hand, and
they floated
>>up to Heaven together."
>>"What about the driver?"
>>Ben shrugged. "I didn't see anyone else."
>>Later Barbara was able to meet the families of the
victims.

provided.
Barbara

I have attached the last Inclement Weather plan updated by our team.  Please 
review your specific area and update as needed.  If your area is not 
reflected, such as Rates or Information and Records Management, please 
develop a plan.  Be sure to check with your primary customers as to their 
expectations and needs for each of these scenarios to ensure you are planning 
appropriate action/coverage.  I would prefer to have this updated by 6/30 to 
be ready for the long July 4th holiday.

remember things could be worse, you know who i am talking to.
love, kisses and hugs to all of you.
I am God.
Today I will be handling all of your problems.
Please remember that I do not need your help.
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do not
attempt to resolve it.  Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do)
box.
It will be addressed in My time, not yours.  Once the matter is placed into
the box, do not hold on to it.
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; don't despair. There are people in
this world for whom driving is an unheard of privilege.
Should you have a bad day at work;
Think of the man who has been out of work for years.
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who has
never known what it's like to love and be loved in return.
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend; Think of the woman in dire
straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her children.
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; Think of
the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer patient
in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine.
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about,
asking what is my purpose?
Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long enough to get the
opportunity.
Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance,
smallness or insecurities;
Remember, things could be worse.
You could be them!!!!
Let it go so God can do His job.

Okiroki Charlie, here goes, as promised.

Take care--Love ya!
Brownie

 Subject: Some armor for the daily battles of life

The only survivor of a shipwreck was washed up on a small, uninhabited 
island.  He prayed feverishly for God to rescue him, and every day he scanned 
the horizon for help, but none seemed forthcoming.  Exhausted, he eventually 
managed to build a little hut out of driftwood to protect himself from the 
elements, and to store his few possessions.  But then one day, after 
scavenging for food, he arrived home to find his little hut in flames, the 
smoke rolling up to the sky. The worst had happened; everything was lost. He 
was stunned with grief and anger.  "God, how could you do this to me!" he 
cried.  Early the next day, however, he was awakened by the sound of a ship 
that was approaching the island. It had come to rescue him.  "How did you 
know I was here?" asked the weary man of his rescuers.  "We saw your smoke 
signal," they replied.

It is easy to get discouraged when things are going bad. But we shouldn't 
lose heart, because God is at work in our lives, even in the midst of pain 
and suffering. Remember, next time your little hut is burning to the ground-- 
it just may be a smoke signal that summons the grace of God.  For all the 
negative things we have to say to ourselves, God  has a positive answer for 
it:

You say: "It's impossible"   --   God says:"All thing are possible" 
(Luke18:27)
You say: "I'm too tired"  --  God says:"I will give you rest" ( Matt11:28-20)
You say: "Nobody really loves me" -- God says:"I love you" (John 3:16 & 
John13:34)
You say: "I can't go on"  --  God says:"My grace is sufficient" (II Cor.12:9 
& Psalm 91:15)             You say: "I can't figure things out" -- God 
says:"I will direct your steps" (Proverbs 3:5-6)
You say: "I can't do it" -- God says:"You can do all things" (Phil 4:13)
You say: "I'm not able" -- God says:"I am able" (II Cor.9:8)
You say:"It's not worth it"  --  God says:"It will be worth it" (Romans 8:28)
You say: "I can't forgive myself"  --  God says:"I forgive you" ( I John 1:9 
& Romans 8:1)
You say: "I can't manage"  -- God says:"I will supply all your needs" (Phil 
4:19)
You say: "I'm afraid"  -- God says:"I have not given you a spirit of fear (II 
Tim. 1:7)
You say: "I'm always worried and frustrated"  --  God says:"Cast all your 
cares on ME" ( I Peter 5:7)
You say: "I don't have enough faith" -- God says: I've given everyone a 
measure of faith (Rom. 12:3)
You say: "I'm not smart enough"  -- God says "I give you wisdom (I Cor 1:30)
You say: "I feel all alone" -- God says:"I will never leave you or forsake 
you" (Heb. 13:5)

Pass this on, you never know whose life may be in need of this today.  I 
believe there are some weeks that we all feel our huts are burning.

Something to think about....

> >>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people
before meeting the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful
for that gift.
> >>
> >>When the door of happiness closes, another opens,
but often times we look so long at the closed door
that we don't see the one which has been opened for
us.
> >>
> >>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on
a porch and swing with,never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation you've
ever had.
> >>
> >>It's true that we don't know what we've got until
we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what
we've been missing until it arrives.
> >>
> >>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance
that they'll love you back!  Don't expect love in
return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if
it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.
> >>
> >>It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone, but
it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
> >>
> >>Don't go for looks; they can deceive.  Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.Go for someone who
makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make
a dark day seem bright.  Find the one that makes your
heart smile.
> >>
> >>There are moments in life when you miss someone so
much that you just want to pick them from your dreams
and hug them for real!
> >>
> >>Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to
go; be what you want to be,because you have only one
life and one chance to do all the things you want to
do.
> >>
> >>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,
enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to
keep you human, enough hope to make you  happy.
> >>
> >>Always put yourself in others' shoes.  If you feel
that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person,
too.
> >>
> >>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything; they just make the most of
everything that comes along their way.
> >>
> >>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt,
those who have searched,and those who have tried, for
only they can appreciate the importance of people who
have touched their lives.
> >>
> >>Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and
ends with a tear.

The brightest future will always be based on a
forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you
let go of your past failures and heartaches.
> >>
> >>When you were born, you were crying and everyone
around you was smiling. Live your life so that when
you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone
around you is crying.
> >>
> >>
> >>
> >>Please send this message to those people who mean
something to you, to those who have touched your life
in one way or another, to those who make you smile
when you really need it, to those that make you see
the
brighter side of things when you are really down, to
those who you want to let them know that you
appreciate their friendship.  And if you don't, don't
worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just
miss out on the opportunity to  brighten someone's day
with this message........

RODRIGUEZ 

Hi ladies.  Even though mother's day has past, I thought you would enjoy 
reading this e-mail I received last week.  It's real good.

A Mother's Thoughts:

We are sitting at lunch when my daughter casually mentions that she and her 
husband are thinking of "starting a family." "We're taking a survey," she 
says, half-joking. "Do you think I should have a baby?"

"It will change your life, "I say, carefully keeping my tone neutral.

"I know," she says, "no more sleeping in on weekends, no more
spontaneous vacations...."

But that is not what I meant at all.  I look at my daughter, trying to
decide what to tell her.  I want her to know what she will never learn in 
childbirth classes.  I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child 
bearing will heal, but that becoming a mother will leave her with an 
emotional wound so raw that she will forever be vulnerable.  I consider 
warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without asking "What 
if that had been MY child?" That every plane crash,every house fire will 
haunt her.  That when she sees pictures of starving children, she will wonder 
if anything could be worse than watching your child die.  I look at her 
carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think that no matter
how sophisticated she is, becoming a mother will reduce her to the
primitive level of a bear protecting her cub.  That an urgent call of "Mom!" 
will cause her to drop a souffl, or her best crystal without a moment's 
hesitation.  I feel I should warn her that no matter how many years she has 
invested in her career, she will be professionally derailed by motherhood.  
She might arrange for childcare, but one day she will be going into an 
important
business meeting and she will think of her baby's sweet smell.  She will have 
to use every ounce of her discipline to keep from running home, just to make 
sure her baby is all right.  I want my daughter to know that everyday 
decisions will no longer be
routine.  That a five year old boy's desire to go to the men's room
rather than the women's at McDonald's will become a major dilemma. That right 
there, in the midst of clattering trays and screaming children, issues of 
independence and gender identity will be weighed against the prospect that a 
child molester may be lurking in that restroom.  However decisive she may be 
at the office, she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother.
Looking at my attractive daughter, I want to assure her that eventually she 
will shed the pounds of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about 
herself.  That her life, now so important, will be of less value to her once 
she has a child.  That she would give it up in a moment to save her 
offspring, but will also begin to hope for more years-not to accomplish her 
own dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.  I want her to know 
that a cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.  My 
daughter's relationship with her husband will change,
but not in the way she thinks.  I wish she could understand how much more you 
can love a man who is careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to 
play with his child.  I think she should know that she will fall in love with 
him again for reasons she would now find every unromantic.  I wish my 
daughter could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout history who 
have tried to stop war, prejudice and drunk driving.  I hope she will 
understand why I can think rationally about most issues, but become 
temporarily insane when I discuss the threat of nuclear war to my
children's future.  I want to describe to my daughter the exhilaration of 
seeing your child learn to ride a bike.  I want to capture for her the belly 
laugh of a baby who is touching the soft fur of a dog or a cat for the first 
time.  I want  her to  taste the joy that is so real, it actually hurts.  My 
daughter's quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes.

"You'll never regret it," I finally say. Then I reach across the table, 
squeeze my daughter's hand and offer a silent prayer for her,and
for me, and for all of the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this 
most wonderful of callings.  This blessed gift from God that of being a 
Mother.

Please share this with a Mom that you know or a future Mom you know.

Good morning my friends.  I probably sent this to some of you before, but I

This is really great, it was through my mother's death that I was blessed 
with meeting Tim. The Lord is faithful and so good to us !!

MOM'S LAST LAUGH.....

Consumed by my loss, I didn't notice the hardness of the
pew where I sat.  I was at the funeral of my dearest friend - my mother.

She finally had lost her long battle with cancer. The hurt
was so intense, I found it hard to breathe at times.

Always supportive, Mother clapped loudest at my school
plays, held a box of tissues while listening to my first heartbreak, 
comforted me at my father's death, encouraged me in college,
and prayed for me my entire life.

When Mother's illness was diagnosed, my sister had a new
baby and my brother had recently married his childhood sweetheart, so it fell 
on me, the 27-year-old middle child without entanglements, to take care of 
her. I counted it an honor.

"What now, Lord?" I asked sitting in church. My life
stretched out before me as an empty abyss. My brother sat stoically with his 
face toward the cross while clutching his wife's hand. My sister sat slumped 
against her husband's shoulder,
his arms around her as she cradled their child.

All so deeply grieving, no one noticed I sat alone.

My place had been with our mother, preparing her meals,
helping her walk, taking her to the doctor, seeing to her medication, reading 
the Bible together. Now she was with the Lord.

My work was finished, and I was alone.

I heard a door open and slam shut at the back of the
church. Quick footsteps hurried along the carpeted floor. An exasperated 
young man looked around briefly and then sat
next to me. He folded his hands and placed them on his
lap. His eyes were brimming with tears. He began to sniffle.

"I'm late," he explained, though no explanation was
necessary.  After several eulogies, he leaned over and commented, "Why do 
they keep calling Mary by the name of 'Margaret'?

"0h" "Because that was her name, Margaret. Never Mary. No
one called her 'Mary,'" I whispered. I wondered why this person couldn't have 
sat on the other side of the church. He interrupted my grieving with his 
tears and fidgeting.

Who was this stranger anyway?

"No, that isn't correct," he insisted, as several people
glanced over at us whispering, "Her name is Mary, Mary Peters."

"That isn't who this is."

"Isn't this the Lutheran church?"

"No, the Lutheran church is across the street."   "Oh."

"I believe you're at the wrong funeral, Sir."

The solemnness of the occasion mixed with the realization
of the man's mistake bubbled up inside me and came out as laughter. I cupped 
my hands over my face, hoping it would be interpreted as sobs.  The creaking 
pew gave me away. Sharp looks from other mourners only made the situation 
seem more hilarious. I peeked at the bewildered, misguided man seated beside 
me. He was laughing, too, as he glanced around,
deciding it was too late for an uneventful exit.  I imagined
Mother laughing.

At the final "Amen," we darted out a door and into the
parking lot. "I do believe we'll be the talk of the town," he smiled. He said 
his name was Rick and since he had missed his aunt's funeral, asked me out 
for a cup of coffee.

That afternoon began a lifelong journey for me with this
man who attended the wrong funeral, but was in the right place.

A year after our meeting, we were married at a country church where he was 
the assistant pastor. This time we both arrived at the same church, right on 
time.

In my time of sorrow, God gave me laughter. In place of
loneliness, God gave me love. This past June we celebrated
our twenty-second wedding anniversary.

Whenever anyone asks us how we met, Rick tells them, "Her
mother and my Aunt Mary introduced us, and it's truly a match made in heaven."

                       ------------------------

Jesus said, "if you are ashamed of me," I will be ashamed
of you before my  Father."

Not ashamed Pass this on . . . only if you mean it.

Yes, I do Love God.

 He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
functioning each and everyday. Without Him, I would be nothing. Without him, 
I am nothing, but with Him I can do all things, through Christ that 
strengthens me.  Phil 4:13

If you Love God, and are not ashamed of all the marvelous
things he has done for you. Send this to ten people and the person who sent 
it to you!

Hello,

We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings 
with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a 
completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the 
month of March.   

NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time 
directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you 
can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can 
add the appropriate activities to your survey.

To fill out the survey:

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled "Select Your RC".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select 
Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labelled "Hours".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a 
problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

Thanks,
Shari

Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way,
she
did what she could o help her 3-year-old son, Michael, prepare for a new
sibling. They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl, and day
after
day, night after
night, Michael sang to his sister in Mommy's tummy. He was building a bond
of
love with his little sister before he even met her.  The pregnancy
progressed
normally for Karen of Morristown, Tennessee. In time, the labor pains came.
Soon
it was every five minutes, every three ...every  minute.  But serious
complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of
labor.
Would a C-section be required?  Finally, after a long struggle, Michael's
little
sister was born. But she was in very serious condition.  With a siren
howling in
the night, the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care
unit
at St. Mary's Hospital, Knoxville, Tennessee.

The days inched by. The little girl got worse. The pediatrician had to tell
the
parents,  "There is very little hope. Be prepared for the worst." Karen and
her
husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot. They had fixed up a
special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves
having to plan for a funeral. Michael, however, kept begging his parents to
let
him see his sister. "I want to sing to her," he kept saying.  Week two in
intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over.
Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister, but kids are never allowed
in
Intensive Care.

Karen made up her mind, though. She would take Michael whether they liked it
or
not! If he didn't see his sister right then, he may never see her alive.
She
dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU.  He looked
like
a walking laundry basket. But the head nurse recognized him as a child and
bellowed, "Get that kid out of here now! No children are allowed."
The mother rose up strong in Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady
glared
steel-eyed right into the head nurse's face, her lips a firm line.
"He is not leaving until he sings to his sister!"
Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside. He gazed at the tiny infant
losing
the battle to live.  After a moment, he began to sing. In the pure-hearted
voice
of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you
make
me happy when skies are gray >>---"
>>Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate began to calm
down
and become steady. "Keep on singing, Michael," encouraged Karen with tears
in
her eyes.
"You never know, dear, how much I love you, Please don't take my sunshine
away-"
As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing became
as
smooth as a kitten's purr. "Keep on singing, Sweetheart!" "The other night,
dear, as I lay
sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms..."
>>Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest,seemed to
sweep
over her.  "Keep on singing, Michael."  Tears had now conquered the face of
the
bossy head nurse. Karen glowed. "You are my sunshine, my only Sunshine.
Please
don't, take my sunshine away..."
>>The next, day...the very next day...the little girl was well enough to go
home!  Woman's Day Magazine called it "The Miracle of a Brother's Song." The
medical staff just called it a miracle.
Karen called it a miracle of God's love!

 NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. LOVE IS SO
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
Life is good. Have a Wonderful Day!

This is the power of prayer at work.  Let's continue to pray for
one another.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that
are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass
on
the love that has been given to you. May you be content knowing that you are
a
child of God. Let His presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul
the
freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the sun. It is there for each and
every
one of you. Send this to others and witness the awesome power of prayer.
Also,
read Phil 4:13

Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born.   The child asked God, 
"They tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow, but I am so small and 
helpless, how will I be able to live there?"   God replied, "Among my many 
angels, the one I have chose for you will be waiting for you and take care of 
you."

The child further inquired, "Here in heaven all I have to do is sing and 
smile to be happy, what happens when I go to earth?"   God said, "Your angel 
will sing for you and smile for you every day. You will feel your angel's 
love and be very happy."

Again the child asked, "I don't know the language, how will I understand when 
people talk to me?"   God said, "Your angel will tell you the most beautiful 
and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care, teach you 
how to speak."

"And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?"   God said, "Your 
angel will place your hands together and teach you how to pray."

"I've heard there are bad men on Earth, who will protect me?"  God said, 
"Your angel will defend you, and even risk its life for you."

"I will not see you anymore, and I will be sad."    God said "Your angel will 
talk to you about me and teach you the way to come back to me.  I will always 
be next to you."

At that moment there was much peace in heaven, but voices from Earth could be 
heard, and the child hurriedly asked, "God, it's time for me to leave now, 
will you please tell me my angel's name?"    God replied, "Her name is not 
important, you will simply call her Mom."

PRAYER WHEEL

When you receive this, say a prayer for the person that sent it to
you.... That's all you have to do....There is nothing attached....This
is powerful.... Just send this to four people and watch God answer
prayer to work in your life.

Do not break this, please.... Prayer is one of the best free gifts we
receive.... There is no cost but a lot of rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another. Thanks for praying.

If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it.
If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it.
He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning.
Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen.
He can live anywhere in the universe, and He chose your heart.
What about the Christmas gift He sent you in Bethlehem; not to
mention that Friday at Calvary.
Face it, friend. He's crazy about you.

______________________________________________
Let's not forget.

Love Ya!

The Lord stood by to observe a baseball game. The Lord's team
was playing Satan's team, The Lord's team was at bat, the
score was tied zero to zero, and it was the bottom of the ninth inning
with two outs.

They continued to watch as a batter stepped up to the plate
whose name was Love. Love swung at the 1st pitch and hit a single,
because Love never fails.

The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single
because Faith works with Love.

The next batter up was named Godly Wisdom. Satan wound up
and threw the first pitch. Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it
ass.

Ball one.  Three more pitches and Godly Wisdom walked, because
Godly Wisdom never swings at what Satan throws.

The bases are loaded. The Lord then turns to Bob and told
him He was now going to bring in His star player. Up to bat
stepped Grace.

Bob said, "He sure doesn't look like much!"  Satan's whole team
relaxed when they saw Grace. Thinking he had won the game, Satan
wound up and fired his first pitch.  To the shock of everyone,
Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever seen.

But Satan was not worried; his center fielder let very few
get by.  He went up for the ball, but it went right through
his glove, hit him on the head and sent him crashing to the
ground; then it continued over the fence for a home run!

The Lord's team won. The Lord then asked Bob if he knew why Love,
Faith and Godly Wisdom could get on base but could not win the
game.  Bob answered that he did not know why. The Lord explained,
"If your love, faith and wisdom had won the game you would think you
had done it by yourself.  Love, faith and wisdom will get you on
base, but only MY Grace can get you home.

"My Grace is the only thing Satan cannot steal."

A simple friend has never seen you cry. 
A real friend has shoulders soggy from your tears.
 
A simple friend doesn't know your parents' first names.
A real friend has their phone numbers in his address book.  

A simple friend brings a bottle of wine to your party.
A real friend comes early to help you cook and stays late to
help you clean.

A simple friend hates it when you call after he has gone to bed.
A real friend asks you why you took so long to call. 

A simple friend seeks to talk with you about your problems.
A real friend seeks to help you with your problems.

A simple friend wonders about your romantic history.
A real friend could blackmail you with it.

A simple friend, when visiting, acts like a guest.
A real friend opens your refrigerator and helps himself.

A simple friend thinks the friendship is over when you have
anargument.
A real friend knows that it's not a friendship until after
you've had a fight.

A simple friend expects you to always be there for them.
A real friend expects to always be there for you!

Pass this on to anyone you care about....if you get it back you
have found your true friends.

A ball is a circle, No beginning, No end.  It keeps us together,
like our circle of friends, but the treasure inside for you to see is
the treasure of friendship you've granted to me.

Today I pass the friendship ball to you.  Pass it on to someone
who is a friend to you.

=02=05---------------------------------------------------------------------=
I drive into work listening to gospel music or a pre-recorded  sermon on th=
e=20
radio. I get out of the car and walk to the building
entrance. As I open the building door I leave just enough room for me to ge=
t=20
in and I leave Jesus standing outside as the door closes behind me. He's=20
standing with His palms on the door glass and watches me as I get on the=20
elevator.  His eyes are sad and He turns and goes to sit on the stone bench=
.=20
There He sits patiently
and waits for me for the next 9 hours. First two hours of work - I fuss and=
=20
complain about things not going right.  Jesus, sitting
with his chin in His hand looks upward toward the building wishing He could=
=20
help me. By lunchtime - I'm flustered, regretting I work in this place and=
=20
sputtering bitterness all over folks. Jesus comes around to the side of the=
=20
building where my cubicle is located. He looks up from the ground trying to=
=20
get my attention but I can't hear him; my focus is on my problems. Jesus go=
es=20
back to the front of the building, sits down and continues to wait for me. =
He=20
thinks to
Himself as He looks up to the third floor, "They went in there defenseless.=
 =20
If only they had taken me in there with them.  When will they learn?" End o=
f=20
the day - I'm pooped, run down, no energy, irritable & frustrated.  I leave=
=20
the building & Jesus gets up happily to greet me but I'm in no mood for Him=
=20
now.  I've just been to hell and back and the last thing I want to do is be=
=20
bothered with anyone.

God just actually showed me this is how I'VE been acting.  He showed me eac=
h=20
act and worst of all, He let me feel a small
portion of how grieved he was because of my actions and
attitude.  I left Jesus standing outside, almost let the door smack him in=
=20
His face.  From time to time our jobs overwhelm us and we completely forget=
=20
to  "take Jesus with us".  We may not go around cursing anyone out or=20
punching anyone in the face (hopefully not) but what are our actions saying=
=20
about us and about whom or whose we are?

We are the salt of the Earth and the light of the world. A city on a hill=
=20
cannot be hidden.  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. =
=20
Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the=20
house. Matt. 5:13-15. We should be bringing
peace to our jobs and not be the cause of confusion.  We should be the ones=

to bring our gifts & talents to the table to help in
WHATEVER area God has chosen for us to work in.  Col.3:23-24 "Whatever you=

Conformed to His Image
Romans 8:29-30
Faith Thoughts for February 3
by Pastor Carl Stevens

The transformed believer enjoys tremendous freedom. II Corinthians 3:17b
says, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." This liberty comes
as the Christian is freed from his natural disposition, with its inevitable
anxiety and loneliness, and is transformed into the image of his Lord. "But
we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord" (II Corinthians 3:18).
It is in this manner that the child of God is able to function in the Kingdom
of God. He is transformed by the image of Jesus Christ functioning and
operating in his human vessel, bringing every thought and imagination into
the obedience of Jesus Christ (2). As the believer presents his body as a
living sacrifice to the Lord, he will experience the good, acceptable, and
perfect will of God (3).

Rather than conforming to the world and its system, the believer is inwardly
changed and transformed to the image of Christ by the power of God (4).
Anxiety, cosmic loneliness, and its undefined consequences are dealt with and
resolved in the transformation.

   When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do.  There is nothing attached.  This is the power of 
prayer at work.  Just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the 
seventh day.

      Do not break this, please.  There is no cost, but lots of rewards.
Let's continue to pray for one another.

      PRAYER::
      May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are 
exactly where you are meant to be.  May you not forget the infinite 
possibilities that are born of faith.  May you use those gifts that you have 
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.  May you be 
content knowing that you are a child of God.  Let His presence settle into 
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in 
the sun.  It is there for each and every one of you

Amen

Send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.

Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
semester!!

Maria

 Friend

When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
have to do.  There
is
nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
to four people and
do
not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
free gifts we
receive.
There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
praying for one
another.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now Lord, show
them

a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
I ask You to
minister

to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
pain, give them
Your
peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
release a renewed
confidence

in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
tiredness, or
exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
patience, and
strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
spiritual
stagnation,

I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
and by drawing them
into

greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
reveal Your love, and
release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
blocking them,
reveal
it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
their finances,
give
them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
to support, and
encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
recognize the demonic
forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
have in You to
defeat
it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In Christian love,
Your Friend in Jesus.

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something I know
Christ
would do.

As many of you know, the opening of Enron Field is quickly approaching.  
Enron Field, the new 42,000 seat retractable roof ballpark, will make its 
debut when the Astros play host to the World Champion New York Yankees on 
March 30th and 31st.  The defending American League West Champion Texas 
Rangers travel to Houston on April 1st.  The Astros open the 2000 
Championship Season on the road before playing host to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the season opener on April 7th.

There have been numerous inquiries about how to secure tickets for Astros 
games at Enron Field.  A limited number of tickets have been allocated for 
Enron for these inaugural games.  However, we anticipate that the demand for 
tickets by employees will exceed this allocation.  In an effort to keep all 
of you informed, Astros tickets will be going on sale for the entire season 
to the general public for single-game tickets beginning this Saturday, 
January 29th at 9:00 a.m.  

 We recommend you secure personal tickets for the games of your choice 
through the traditional Astros ticket outlets listed below.  Enron will sell 
a significant portion of its allotted tickets to employees in late February; 
however, please remember that our supply of tickets is limited and will sell 
out quickly.

 March 30 vs. New York Yankees (Inaugural exhibition game)
 March 31 vs. New York Yankees
 April 1 vs. Texas Rangers
 April 7 vs. Philadelphia Phillies (Opening Day)

ADVANCED TICKET PURCHASES:
Tickets for all 84 home games, including three exhibition games, will be 
available at the Astrodome Box Office and the usual Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone may do so by calling (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also 
accessible on-line at  www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

A detailed follow up e-mail will be sent to provide more information on when 
and where the Enron tickets will be sold.  In addition, Astros tickets will 
be available to Enron employees throughout the season, and we will notify you 
of these opportunities.

Below are some "points to ponder" that will help anyone with the daily 
challenges we face getting through life, and choosing to enjoy life rather 
than just going through the paces.

 And, it most cases, this type of wisdom will do more for our lives than any 
degree could. 
                     From one who is "still learning"...... 
I Have Learned...
  I've  learned....
         that the best  classroom in the world
         is at the  feet of an elderly person.

  I've  learned....
         that when you're in  love, it shows.

  I've  learned....
        that just one person  saying to me,
         "You've made my  day!" makes my day.

 I've  learned....
        that I feel better  about myself when
         I make others  feel better about themselves.

  I've  learned....
         that having a child  fall asleep in your
         arms is one of  the most peaceful
         feelings in the  world.

  I've  learned....
         that what we have done  for ourselves
        alone dies with us.  What we have done
         for others and  the world remains and
         is  immortal.

  I've  learned....
         that one sincere  apology is worth more
         than all the  roses money can buy.

  I've  learned....
         that words harshly  spoken are as difficult
         to  retrieve as feathers in a gale.

 I've  learned....
         that being kind is  more important than
         being  right.

 I've  learned....
         that you should never  say no to a
        gift from a  child.
  I've  learned....
        that I can always pray  for someone when
         I don't have the  strength to help him
        in some other  way.

  I've learned....
          that no matter how serious your  life
         requires you to be, everyone  needs a
         friend to act goofy  with.

 I've  learned....
        that sometimes all a  person needs is a
        hand to hold and  a heart to understand.

 I've  learned....
         that simple walks with  my father around
        the block on  summer nights when I was
         a child  did wonders for me as an adult.

 I've  learned....
         that life is like a  roll of toilet paper.
         The closer  it gets to the end, the
         faster it  goes.

 I've  learned....
         that we should be glad  God doesn't
         give us everything we  ask for.

 I've  learned....
         that money doesn't buy  class.

 I've  learned....
         that it's those small  daily happenings
         that make life so  spectacular.

 I've  learned....
         that once a  relationship is over,
        if you  experienced more smiles than
          tears, then it wasn't a waste of time.

 I've  learned....
        that under everyone's  hard shell is
         someone who wants to  be appreciated
         and  loved.

  I've  learned....
         never to humiliate  another person.
         Always give him an  honorable way to
         back down or out  of something and
         still save  face.

  I've  learned....
         that the Lord didn't  do it all in one
         day. What makes  me think I can?

  I've  learned....
         that if you are still  talking about
         what you did  yesterday, you haven't
         done much  today.

  I've  learned....
         that to ignore the  facts does not
         change the  facts.

  I've  learned....
         that when you plan to  get even with
        someone, you are  only letting that
         person continue  to hurt you.

  I've  learned....
        that it is best to  give advice in only
         two  circumstances; when it is  requested
         and when it is a  life-threatening
         situation.

  I've  learned....
         that a good friend is  the one who tells
        you how you  really look in your jeans.

  I've  learned....
        that the less time I  have to work with,
         the more things  I get done.

  I've learned. . .
      That poetry is not just words but feelings

 I've learned. . .
      helping people in need is the best thing we
      ever could do.

 I've learned , , .
      life is not what you acheived, or winning
      but the many times you have lended an ear,
      a hand, and a heart.

 I've learned,
      that no matter what education you attain,
     how many diplomas you gained.
      doesnt mean you can understand everyhting.

 I'ver learned,
      that the more pain and hurt you experience
      the more knowledgeable and understanding you are.

 I've, learned. . .  I am learning

HI! No I have not heard anything . I'm still waiting...

Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
semester!!

Maria

 Friend

When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
have to do.  There
is
nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
to four people and
do
not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
free gifts we
receive.
There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
praying for one
another.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now Lord, show
them

a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
I ask You to
minister

to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
pain, give them
Your
peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
release a renewed
confidence

in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
tiredness, or
exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
patience, and
strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
spiritual
stagnation,

I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
and by drawing them
into

greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
reveal Your love, and
release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
blocking them,
reveal
it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
their finances,
give
them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
to support, and
encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
recognize the demonic
forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
have in You to
defeat
it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In Christian love,
Your Friend in Jesus.

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something I know
Christ
would do.

   When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do.  There is nothing attached.  This is the power of 
prayer at work.  Just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the 
seventh day.

      Do not break this, please.  There is no cost, but lots of rewards.
Let's continue to pray for one another.

      PRAYER::
      May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are 
exactly where you are meant to be.  May you not forget the infinite 
possibilities that are born of faith.  May you use those gifts that you have 
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.  May you be 
content knowing that you are a child of God.  Let His presence settle into 
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in 
the sun.  It is there for each and every one of you

Amen

Send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.

ECAR
  
There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 
mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at 
this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On 
saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's 
were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), 
unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most 
utilities will be sellers in the morning.   

 ECAR   FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 25.6   OFFER $ 27.5
   SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.5   OFFER $ 26.9
   SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $  9.9  OFFER $ 17.2 

MAIN

 TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members 
were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while 
sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be 
selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr 
schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will 
also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in 
picking up a preschedule. 

 MAIN  FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 19.7   OFFER $ 30.4
   SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.1   OFFER $ 20.7
   SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $ 9.4   OFFER $ 15.7

ECAR
  
Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low 
twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing 
power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with 
offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. 
for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This 
was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will 
have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No 
one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday. 

MAIN

Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak 
were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, 
Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on 
a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors 
in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning 
he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only 
bid for a preschedule in Main.

FRCC

 For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement 
of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in 
calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 
24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly 
from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours.  
For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and 
the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    
 

SERC

TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of 
power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces 
showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's.  
We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO 
$45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 
20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of 
the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA 
starting in the afternoon.    

HERE ARE MY ACCOMPLISMENTS FROM JUNE OF 
2000.                                                                         
          I HAVE TRACKED AT LEAST 40,000 DOCUMENTS IN THE TAGG DEAL CLEARING 
DATABASE.     THIS INCLUDES GAS, POWER, AND SITARA DOCUMENTS.                 
                                                              I SEPERATE AND 
DISTRIBUTE ALL INCOMING PAPER FROM OUR INCOMING PRINTER.                   I

                                   I HAVE ASSISSTED THE RESEARCH OF VARIOUS 
LISTS OF GAS AND POWER DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO UPDATE THE STATUS OF THESE 
DOCUMENTS.                                                                    
        I HAVE ALSO TRAINED FOUR EMPLOYEES IN THE VARIOUS DATABASES SUCH AS 
TAGG, DECAF II, LIVELINK, ASCENT, AND ENCOPY, AND ALSO TRAINING OF USING OUR 
FAX 
MACHINES.                                                                     
                                              

hey, baby you are the only person who e-mails anything!

i have the dental forms, can you take them to the dentist tomorrow if you get 
a chance, thanks!!

SERC

Evening peak prices remained strong until he 22.  OPC was a low 40's bid 
untill he 22.  We prescheduled 100 mw's to SOCO for $95 from he 20-22.  SCEG, 
DUKE  and SC were low 40's bids for the evening peak.  CPL was the only 
reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being 
started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO 
was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or 
into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not 
show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying 
hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics.  
SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.  

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 50  OFFER $ 80

FRCC

Bids were not very strong in Florida for the evening peak.   Rain helped the 
Florida utilities cover their loads.  For he 21-22 TAL, FPL and FPC were mid 
40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening 
peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens, 
there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will wait 
until mid morning to look for preschedules.  
  
        
 FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 90  OFFER $ 150

TLR's were again the story in SERC.  TLR's were not lifted until 1:00 a.m.  
We could not move anything from ECAR into SERC.  This was not the case for 
the AEP marketers, TVA trans. made a mistake by allowing a new schedule to be 
started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and 
SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for 
he 20.  SOCO was a $60 bid across the evening peak.  SCEG was the only other 
bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units.  
VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and 
OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them 
$24 for he 24.  We also sold $15.50's to SOCO  for he 2-6.   CPL was the only 
 offer at $19.50.  SOCO had no offer for off-peak, they had to much 
maintenance to offer anything out.  For Thursday  SOCO, OPC and SCEG will 
again be buying hourly after the morning peak.  DUKE, CPL and VEPCO will have 
hourly to sell tomorrow.    

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 43.9  OFFER $ 60.2

FRCC

After the preschedule we sold FPC through he 19,  FPC was a $50 bid.   FPL 
would not show a bid for he 20.  FPL was a $70 offer beginning he 21.  FPL 
was the only offer for across the evening peak.  FPL showed $140 for he 20.  
FPL began  selling $60-$70 to SOCO for he 21-22.  Off-peak was the same as 
yesterday with bids in the mid teens,  there was no real interest in buying 
off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will again be on the bid for b.o.d. schedules.  

Jeff, I fax the ecar hourly price index again for the 19th.  I did forget to 
put "attn:  bobette" on the fax to her.

SERC

A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain 
covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 
21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 
21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called 
by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has 
not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well 
generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For 
off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and 
SCEG will be on the bid.       

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5

FRCC

Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the 
evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought 
$21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat 
for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for 
friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a 
decision on any b.o.d preschedules.      
        
 FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 68.8  OFFER $ 139.7

FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12.  
For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's 
prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due 
to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   

SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For 
HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from 
TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us 
they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35.  
DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to 
SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  

ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.   Bid's were in the 30's with 
offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the 
$35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 
30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid.

ecar
The utilities directly connected to the pool were
offering out power in the twenties for most of
saturday. AEP was a mid teen bid for Sat urday
morning, and was offering out mid twenties for the
afternoon. Sige and DPl were on the bid but wouldn't
pay more than low to mid 20's.

Main
CE was offering poer in the low twenties all day. We
actually bought $20 late in the afternoon. IP was flat
all day since we stole all their guys. AMRN was
offering power all day around 23. Lots of TLR's

SERC-   For Saturday we sold 200MW (HE15-19 for a 5 hour take) @ $80.00.  
SCEG and DUKE were bidding in the mid 40's.  Due to TLR's power from the 
North could not flow to SERC.  Off-peak bids for Saturday were in the low 
teens.  SOCO was an $11 bid for off-peak.  Everyone else in SERC was flat or 
a low teen bid.  For Sunday SOCO was a $26 bid during the afternoon peak.  
SCEG was a $34 bid.  TLR's prevented any deals getting done with SCEG during 
the afternoon.  DUKE, SCEG and SOSO will be on the bid for Monday.  

FRCC-   For Saturday we sold power to Florida in the morning but were cut due 
to TLR's starting HE11.  Bids in Florida got to as high as mid 60's.  FPL and 
FPC were the one's bidding in the mid 60's.  TLR's were not lifted until H/E 
1, for H/E 1 we sold FPL $22(100mw's) into JEA.  For Sunday FP&L and TALL 
were both on the BID @ $26-35 Hourly in the morning and  BOD @ $ 55-65.00.  
Sunday morning we began buying  power from CE  and selling it to FPL and 
TALL.  TLR's were called startng H/E 11.  Florida was bidding in the mid 40's 
for a 16-hour schedule for Monday.    Offpeak bids were in the mid teens for 
both Saturday and Sunday night.

ERCOT-  For Saturday bids were in the low to mid 30's.  Offers were in the 
high 40's(CSW and HLP) to mid 50's(TU).  We sold the City of GARLAND $54 for 
he 23 and 24.  Their bid was high due to trans. contraints from the south to 
north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up 
being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north 
enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will 
not be allowed to send out any power when south to north transmission is set 
to -0-.  For Sunday bids were in the 30's again.  Reliant and TU told us they 
will be bidding for HE 14-21.  We purchased trans. into ERCOT for these 
hours.   

I love these little guys....they're so cute.

GRETCHEN  I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SOUTHEAST HEDGE BOOK IN DEAL BLOTTER.  THE 
GTC TRANS. HAS NOT BEEN ENTERED/ROUTED IN ENPOWER.

SERC- For Saturday SOCO was on the bid  in the mid 40's during the afternoon 
peak.  They were buying up to 500mw from FPL.  The Florida utilities were 
sellers due the rains they were getting in the afternoon.  SCEG was a low 
30's bid during the afternoon bid.  Duke was flat all day.  OPC was also a 
hig 30's bid much of the afternoon.  We managed to sell SOCO 200 mws for 2 
hours until TLR's ended the sale.  

 -For Sunday SOCO was a low 20' bid in the morning and in the afternoon was a 
low 30's bid.  Duke was seller  in the mid 30's all day.  SCEG was also an 
hourly seller, unfortunately SCEG was limited to where they could go.  DUKE 
and VEPCO will have hourly to sell for Monday. 

FRCC-For Saturday Florida was a seller due to rains over much of the state.  
FPL was offering 60's much of the day.  They were a big seller to SOCO much 
of Saturday.  

 -For Sunday things were a little different.  FPL was a bid in the low 60's 
for the afternoon peak.  By afternoon time TLR's prevented any power from 
going into Florida.  

ERCOT- For Saturday an afternoon schedule traded for $75 and after this went 
through ERCOT prices went up.  WE sold $75  to Reliant for HE 16.  For HE 
17-19 no power was to be found in ERCOT.  HLP was $100 bid for these hours.  
TU would not show us bid for these hours.  

 -For Sunday power was offered out at $55 with no bids(low 30's bids).  No 
transmission avail. for HE 14-19 going up to the North.  

Yes it was Laura.  Sorry for the inconvience.

Rich, tell me this meeting is work related.  I say this because I have 
limited passes each month.  Let me know, I hope its work related.

I'll call in tomorrow to get the time and place.

SERC-  Soco a mid 20's to low 30's bid through the afternoon peak.  They did 
not show an offer, other than quoting CT's.  They bought from their 
neighbors.  Duke was a seller most of the day in the mid 30's to mid 40's.  
OPC's bid never got higher than a mid 30's.  They also bought from DUKE.  
Vepco offered out in the 40's to 50's.   SOCO, OPC  will be on the bid for 
Monday.  TVA was offered power in the mid 20's to mid 30's with no 
response(I'll take your number down).

FRCC- FPC was best bid buying up to $70.  We began selling to them HE 10 at 
$10 and walked them up to $70 (200mw's).  FPL showed very little interest in 
getting anything into them.  TECO got rain all day and did not show a bid.  
TAL also did not show a bid.  FPL and FPC will on the bid for hourly power on 
Monday.

ERCOT- Bids in the morning were very weak HLP was a $30.  TU did not show a 
bid in the morning hours and they were a $65 offer.  Heading into the 
afternoon.  HLP was a $40 bid during HE 14-18.  TU was a $50 bid for HE 
14-18, no trans available going south to north.  CSW offered $45 in the south 
and $65 in the north.  TU will be looking in the hourly marketet for monday.  
We have 85 mw's of trans. from spp to ercot.

Looking at my schedule, I could take off my days on Saturday the 21st and

Monday the 23rd because there are only two of us on that night.  I would be 
very happy to make this change.  Please let me know ASAP if this is 
acceptable so I can make the appropriate plans.

Guys,

I know this is getting to the point of nagging, but the day guys are doing a 
BAD job of getting there stuff in the P&L and Enpower.  We are having to 
spend too much time going back and researching tags and comparing enpower to 
P&L and vice versa before we can even begin to checkout.  I spent two hours 
having to go through many deals (in both books) to figure out what happened 
before we could begin checkouts.  I understand some human errors occur - 
that's why we do checkout's but much of this I feel is just laziness and guys 
not paying attention.  Can you guys address this and try to implement some 
steps to help correct this.  With the lack of bodies on the night shift, this 
is causing problems.

Thanks,
Doug

Kurt at AECI showed AECI purchasing 96 mws at $38 for HE 9.  The P&L showed 
this deal at $40.  I offered to meet in the middle at $39.  Kurt preferred to 
pull the tapes and review the deal with his day guy that did the deal.  This 
is a heads up on the situation.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen

Congrats!!!!!  That is one good looking baby!!!!  Let us know when  we can 
come over to check him out.

?
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.

The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

Reason, Season and Lifetime

People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.
When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.
When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to
meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.
They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you
with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or
spiritually.
They may seem like a godsend, and they are.
They are there for the reason you need them to be.
Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this
person willsay or do something to bring the relationship to an end.
Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.
Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.
What we must realize is that our need has been  met, our desire fulfilled;
their work is done.
The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.

When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because
 your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.
They may bring you an experience of  peace or make you laugh.
They may teach you something you have never done.
They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it!
It is real!  But, only for a season.

LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things
you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation.
Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put
what  you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your
life.
It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

Thank you for being a part of my life... Smile and stop here if you're not
into this final part: This is to show people you love them and to see how
many people love you!!
Don't feel embarrassed cause only you will get the results. Send it to every
friend
that you have online, including the person who sent it to you.

0 Replies = you may need to work on your people skills
2 Replies = you are nice but probably need to be more outgoing.
4 Replies = you have picked your friends well
6 Replies = you are downright popular
8 Replies or More = you are totally awesome (and probably know why you're on
MY list)!

When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do. There is nothing attached. This is the power of
prayer
at work. Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on the fourth
day.
Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but lots of rewards.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you. May you be
content
knowing that you are a child of God. Let His presence settle into your
bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the
sun.
It is there for each and every one of you.

Send this to (4) or more people and witness the awesome power
of prayer.

God Bless.

OR IS IT FUNNY?

Funny how simple it is  for people to trash God ...
      and then wonder why the world's going to hell.

        Funny how we believe what the newspapers say,
       but question what the Bible says.

Funny how everyone wants to go to heaven
       provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the
Bible says.

Or is it scary?

       Funny how someone can say "I believe in God"
but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also "believes" in God).

 Funny how you can send a thousand  'jokes' through e-mail
and they spread like wildfire,
but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord,
people think twice about sharing.

       Funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through
cyberspace,
but the public discussion of Jesus
is suppressed in the school and workplace.

Funny, isn't it?

Funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday,
but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.

Are you laughing?

Funny how when you go to  forward this  message,
      you will not send it to too many on your address list because you're
not
sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to
them.

Funny how I can be more worried about what other people
think of me than what God thinks of me.

       Are you thinking?

      I'm thinking and I have the courage to send this...do you?

Country Doctor

An old country doctor went deep into the woods to  deliver a
baby. The cabin was so remote that it had no electricity.
Upon  arriving, the doctor realized that the laboring mother
and her five-year-old  child were the only people there.
With no one else to help him, the doctor  finally instructed
the child to hold a lantern so he could see to deliver  the
baby.
The child was happy to help, and held the lantern high
while  the mother pushed. After a little while, the baby was
born, and the doctor  held the newborn by the feet and
spanked him on the bottom to get him to take  his first
breath.
With the excitement over, the doctor asked  the
five-year-old for an opinion about the baby.

"Hit him again," the  five-year-old said. "He shouldn't have
crawled up there in the first  place!"

A new teacher started her class by saying, "Whoever thinks they're stupid
can stand up."  After a few seconds, little Johnny stood.  "Do you think
you're stupid, little Johnny?" she asked.  "No ma'am," he replied, "but I
hate to see you standing there all by yourself."

Barney Can't Compete
In the Minneapolis Star-Tribune (1/17/98) Judy Zmerold writes:

Three-year-old Katie was taken to her pediatrician during a recent
bout with the flu. As the doctor examined her ears, he asked, "Will I find Big
Bird in here?"

Apprehensively, Katie replied, "No."

Then, before examining her throat, he asked, "Will I find the Cookie
Monster in here?"

Again, "No."

Finally, listening to her heart, he asked, "Will I find Barney in here?"

With innocent conviction, she looked him directly in the eye and
said, "No, Jesus is in my heart. Barney is on my underwear."

True Story - many of you probably already know about the pitfalls, traps, and 
predators on the internet, but this is something to consider for your 
children and families.  This story is something those of you with children 
who are home alone and/or enjoy chat rooms, talk groups, buddy lists etc 
should be aware of.  Share this with others you think would benefit.  Thanks.

>> Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she
>> walked toward home.  The thought of being followed
>> made her heart beat faster.  "You're being silly," she
>> told herself, "no one is following you."  To be safe,
>> she began to walk faster, but the footsteps kept up
>> with her pace.  She was afraid to look back and she
>> was glad she was almost home.
>>
>> Shannon said a quick prayer, "God please get me
>> home safe."  She saw the porch light burning and
>> ran the rest of the way to her house. Once  inside,
>> she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved
>> to be in the safety of her home. She glanced out the
>> window to see if anyone was there. The sidewalk
>> was empty. After tossing her books on the sofa, she
>> decided to grab a snack and get on-line.
>>
>> She logged on under her screen name ByAngel213.
>> She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo123 was
>> on.  She sent him an instant message:
>>
>> ByAngel213: Hi I'm glad you are on!  I thought
>> someone was following me home today.  It was
>> really weird!
>>
>> GoTo123: LOL You watch too much TV.  Why
>> would someone be following you? Don't you live
>> in a safe neighborhood?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Of course I do.  LOL I guess it was my
>> imagination cuz' I didn't see anybody when I looked
>> out.
>>
>> GoTo123: Unless you gave your name out on-line.
>> You haven't done that have you?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Of course not.  I'm not stupid you know.
>>
>> GoTo123: Did you have a softball game after school
>> today?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Yes and we won!!
>>
>> GoTo123: That's great!  Who did you play?
>>
>> ByAngel213: We played the Hornets.  LOL.
>> Their uniforms are so gross!  They look like
>> bees. LOL
>>
>> GoTo123: What is your team called?
>>
>> ByAngel213: We are the Canton Cats.  We
>> have tiger paws on our uniforms.  They are really
>> kewl.
>>
>> GoTo123: Did you pitch?
>>
>> ByAngel213: No I play second base.  I got to go.  My
>> homework has to be done before my parents get
>> home.  I don't want them mad at me. Bye!
>>
>> GoTo123: Catch you later. Bye
>>
>> Meanwhile......
>> GoTo123 went to the member menu and began to
>> search for her profile. When it came up, he highlighted
>> it and printed it out. He took out a pen and began to
>> write down what he knew about Angel so far.
>>             Her name: Shannon
>>             Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985
>>             Age:13
>>             State where she lived: North Carolina
>>             Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and
>>             going to the mall.
>>
>> Besides this information, he knew she lived in Canton
>> because she had just told him. He knew she stayed
>> by herself until 6:30 p.m. every afternoon until her
>> parents came home from work. He knew she played
>> softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team,
>> and the team was named the Canton Cats. Her
>> favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey. He knew
>> she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior
>> High School.  She had told him all this in the
>> conversations they had on-line. He had enough
>> information to find her now.
>>
>> Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on
>> the way home from the ball park that day. She didn't
>> want them to make a scene and stop her from walking
>> home from the softball games. Parents were always
>> overreacting and hers were the worst. It made her
>> wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had
>> brothers and sisters, her parents wouldn't be so
>> overprotective.
>>
>> By Thursday, Shannon had forgotten about the
>> footsteps following her. Her game was in full swing
>> when suddenly she felt someone staring at her. It was
>> then that the memory came back. She glanced up
>> from her second base position to see a man watching
>> her closely. He was leaning against the fence behind
>> first base and he smiled when she looked at him. He
>> didn't look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear
>> she had felt.
>>
>> After the game, he sat on a bleacher while she talked
>> to the coach. She noticed his smile once again as
>> she walked past him.  He nodded and she smiled
>> back.  He noticed her name on the back of her shirt
>> He knew he had found her. Quietly, he walked a safe
>> distance behind her. It was only a few blocks to
>> Shannon's home, and once he saw where she lived
>> he quickly returned to the park to get his car. Now he
>> had to wait He decided to get a bite to eat until the
>> time came to go to Shannon's house.  He drove to a
>> fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make
>> his move.
>>
>> Shannon was in her room later that evening when she
>> heard voices in the living room. "Shannon, come
>> here," her father called.  He sounded upset and she
>> couldn't imagine why. She went into the room to see
>> the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa.
>> "Sit down," her father began, "this man has just told
>> us a most interesting story about you." Shannon
>> moved cautiously to a chair across from the man
>> How could he tell her parents anything? She had
>> never seen him before today!  "Do you know who I
>> am Shannon?"  The man asked.
>>
>> "No," Shannon answered.
>>
>> "I am a police officer and your online friend, GoTo123."
>>
>> Shannon was stunned.  "That's impossible! GoTo is
>> a kid my age! He's 14 and he lives in Michigan!"
>>
>> The man smiled. "I know I told you all that, but it
>> wasn't true You see, Shannon, there are people on-
>> line who pretend to be kids; I was one of them.  But
>> while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong
>> to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from
>> predators. I came here to find you to teach you how
>> dangerous it is to give out too much information to
>> people on-line. You told me enough about yourself to
>> make it easy for me to find you. Your name, the
>> school you went to, the name of your ball team and
>> the position you played. The number and name on
>> your jersey just made finding you a breeze."
>>
>> Shannon was stunned.  "You mean you don't live in
>> Michigan?"
>>
>> He laughed. "No, I live in Raleigh. It made you feel safe
>> to think I was so far away, didn't it?"
>>
>> She nodded.
>>
>> "I had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she
>> wasn't as lucky.  The guy found her and murdered her
>> while she was home alone. Kids are taught not to tell
>> anyone when they are alone, yet they do it all the time
>> on-line.  The wrong people trick you into giving out
>> information a little here and there on-line.  Before you
>> know it, you have told them enough for them to find
>> you without even realizing you have done it.  I hope
>> you've learned a lesson from this and won't do it again"
>>
>> "I won't," Shannon promised solemnly.
>>
>> "Will you tell others about this so they will be safe
>> too?"
>>
>> "It's a promise!"
>>

      ON A POSITIVE NOTE:
      On a positive note I've learned that no matter what happens,
or how bad
      it
      seems today,
      life does go on, and it will be better  tomorrow.  I've
learned that you
      can
      tell a
      lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three
things: a rainy

      day, lost
      luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've learned
that regardless
      of
      your
            relationship with your parents, you'll miss
them when they're gone from your life.
            I've learned that making a "living" is not
the same thing as making a "life."
            I've learned that life sometimes gives you a
second chance. I've learned
      that you
      shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both
hands. You need
      to
      be able to
            throw something back.  I've learned that if
you pursue happiness, it will elude you.
            But if you focus on your family, your
friends, the needs of others, your
      work and doing
      the very best you can, happiness will find you. I've learned
that
      whenever I
      decide
      something with an open heart, I usually make the right
decision. I've
      learned that even
      when I have pains, I don't have to be one.  I've learned
that every day
      you
      should
      reach out and touch someone.  People love that human touch,
holding
      hands, a
      warm hug,
            or just a friendly pat on the back. I've
learned that I still have a lot to learn.
      I've learned that you should pass this on to someone you
care about. I
      just
      did. Sometimes
      they just need a little something to make them smile.

            Note: people will forget what you said,
people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made
them feel.

A Box Full of Kisses

The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year old daughter
for
wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became
infuriated
when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
Never
the less, the little girl brought the box to her father the next morning
and
said, "This is for you Daddy". He was embarrassed by his earlier over
reaction,
but his temper flared again when he found that the box was empty. He
yelled at
her, " Don't you know when you give someone a present, there's supposed
to be
something inside it". The little girl looked at him with tears in her
eyes and
said, "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty, I blew Kisses into the box. All for
you,
Daddy" The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl and
begged
for her forgiveness. An accident took the life of the child only a short
time
later and it is told that man kept that gold box by his bed for many
years and
whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and
remember
the love of the child who had put it there. In a very real sense, each of
us, as
humans, have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love
and
kisses from our children, friends, family or God. There is no more
precious
possession anyone can hold.

Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble
remembering how to fly.

This is a very good person to know.

Today I met  a great new friend
Who knew me right away 
It was funny how she understood 
All I had to say 

She listened  to my problems
She listened to my dreams 
We talked about love and life 
She'd been there, too, it seems 

 I never once  felt judged by her
She knew just how I felt 
She seemed to just accept me 
And all the problems I'd been dealt 

She didn't  interrupt me
Or need to have her say 
She just listened very patiently 
And didn't go away 

I wanted her  to understand
How much this meant to me 
But as I went to hug her 
Something startled me 

I put my arms  in front of me
And went to pull her nearer 
And realized that my new best friend 
Was nothing but a mirror.

True Friends are hard to come by. Your  first true friend should be yourself.

The Biggest Mathematical Miracle in the World!

Moses and his people were in the desert, but
what was he going to do with them?
They had to be fed, and fed is what he did,
according to the Quartermaster General in the
Army.  It is reported that Moses would have to have
had 1500 tons of food each day.

Do you know that to bring that much food each
day, two freight trains, each a mile long,  would be required!
Besides you must remember, they were out in the desert, so they
would have to have firewood to use in cooking the food.
This would take 4000 tons of wood and a few
more  freight trains, each a mile long,  just for one day.

And just think, they were forty years in transit.
And oh yes! They would have to have water. If they
only had enough to drink and wash a few dishes,
it would take 11,000,000 gallons each day, and a
freight train with tank cars, 1800 miles long, just to bring water!

And then another thing! They had to get across
the Red Sea at night. (They did?) Now, if they went on
a narrow path, double file, the line would be 800
miles long and would require 35 days and  nights
to get through. So, there had to be a space in the Red Sea,
3 miles  wide so that they could walk 5000 abreast to get
over in one night.

But then, there is another problem. Each time
they camped at the end of  the day, a campground
two-thirds the size of the state of Rhode Island was
required, or a total of 750 square miles
long...think of  it! This space just for nightly camping.

Do you think Moses figured all this out
before he left Egypt?

I think not!

You see, Moses believed in God.

God took care of these things for him.

Now do you think God has any problem taking
care of all your needs?
I ASKED THE LORD TO BLESS YOU.......
I asked the Lord to bless you As I prayed for you today,
To guide you and protect you As you go along your way....
His love is always with you,
His promises are true,
And when we give Him all our cares,
You know He will see us through.
So when the road you're traveling on
Seems difficult at best,
Just remember I'm here praying
And God will do the rest.

Pass this to at least 10 people you want God to bless, don't
forget to send it back to the one who asked
God to bless you first.
A POSITIVE  ATTITUDE CAUSES A CHAIN REACTION OF
POSITIVE THOUGHTS, EVENTS  AND OUTCOMES!!

The government recently calculated the cost of raising a child from birth
to
18 and came up with $160,140.00 for a middle-income family.  Talk about
sticker shock. That doesn't even touch college tuition. For those with
kids,
that figure leads to wild fantasies about all the things we could have
bought, all the places we could have traveled, all the money we could have
banked if not for (insert child's name here).  For others, that number
might
confirm the decision to remain childless.

But $160,140.00 isn't so bad if you break it down. It translates into
$8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month or $171.08 a week. That's a mere $24.44 a
day.  Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you might think the best financial
advice says don't have children if you want to be rich.

It's just the opposite.  There's no way to put a price tag on:
Feeling a new life move for the first time and seeing the bump of a knee
rippling across your skin. Having someone cry, "It's a boy!" or shout,
"It's
a girl!" then hearing the baby wail and knowing all that matters is it's
healthy. Counting all 10 fingers and toes for the first time.  Feeling the
warmth of fat cheeks against your breast. Cupping an entire head in the
palm
of your hand. Making out dada or mama from all the cooing and gurgling.

What do you get for your $160,140.00?
Naming rights. First, middle and last.
Glimpses of God every day.
Giggles under the covers every night.
More love than your heart can hold.
Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.
Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds and warm cookies.
A hand to hold, usually covered with jam.
A partner for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building sandcastles and
skipping down the sidewalk in the pouring rain.  Someone to laugh yourself
silly with no matter what the boss said or how your stocks performed that
day.

For $160,140.00, you never have to grow up.  You get to finger-paint, carve
pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, catch lightning bugs and never stop believing
in Santa Clause.  You have an excuse to keep reading the adventures of
Piglet and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney movies
and wishing on stars.

You get to frame rainbows, hearts and flowers under refrigerator magnets
and
collect spray-painted noodle wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay
for Mother's Day and cards with backward letters for Father's Day.

For $160,140.00, there's no greater bang for your buck.  You get to be a
hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the garage roof, taking the training
wheels off the bike, removing a sliver, filling the wading pool, coaxing a
wad of gum out of bangs and coaching a baseball team that never wins but
always gets treated to ice cream regardless.

You get a front-row seat to history; to witness the first step, first word,
first bra, first date, first time behind the wheel.  You get to be
immortal.
You get another branch added to your family tree, and if you're lucky, a
long list of limbs in your obituary called grandchildren.

You get an education in psychology, nursing, criminal justice,
communications and human sexuality no college can match.  In the eyes of a
child, you rank right up there with God.  You have the power to heal a
boo-boo, scare away monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart, police a
slumber party, ground them forever and love them without limits, so one day
they will, like you, love without counting the cost.

This is a very nice story.  You never know when Jesus will visit you so 
always be willing to give.  I don't consider this to be a chain letter, I 
just like the story and I thought you would too.

Ruth went to her mail box and there was only one letter.  She picked it
up and looked at it before opening, but then  she looked at the envelope
again. There was no stamp, no postmark, only her name and address.  She
read the letter:

Dear Ruth:

I'm going to be in your neighborhood Saturday afternoon and I would like
to visit.

Love Always,
Jesus

Her hands were shaking as she placed the letter on the table.   "Why
would the Lord want to visit me?   I'm nobody special.  I don't have
anything to offer."   With that thought,  Ruth remembered her empty
kitchen cabinets. "Oh my  goodness,  I really don't have anything to
offer.  I'll have to run down  to the store and buy something for
dinner."  She reached for her purse and counted out it's contents.
Five dollars and forty cents. "Well, I can get some bread and cold cuts,
at least."   She threw on her coat and hurried out the door. A loaf of
french bread, a half-pound of sliced turkey, and a carton of
milk...leaving Ruth with grand total of twelve cents to last her until
Monday.   Nonetheless, she felt good as she headed home, her meager
offerings tucked under her arm."Hey lady, can you help us, lady?"  Ruth
had been so absorbed in her dinner plans, she hadn't even noticed two
figures huddled in the alleyway. A man and a woman, both of them dressed
in little more than rags.   "Look lady, I ain't got a job, ya know, and
my wife and I have been living  out here  on the street, and, well, now
it's getting cold and  we're getting kinda hungry and, well, if you
could help us, lady, we'd really appreciate it." Ruth looked at them
both.  They were dirty, they smelled bad and frankly, she was certain
that they could get some kind of work if they really wanted to.  "Sir,
I'd like to help  you, but I'm a poor woman myself.  All I have is a few
cold cuts  and  some  bread, and I'm having an important guest for
dinner  tonight  and  I was planning on serving that to Him." "Yeah,
well, okay lady, I understand.  Thanks anyway."  The man put his arm
around the woman's shoulders,  turned and  he headed back into the
alley.  As she watched them leave, Ruth felt a familiar twinge in her
heart.  "Sir, wait!"   The couple stopped and turned as she ran down the
alley after them.  "Look, why don't you take this food.  I'll figure out
something  else to serve my  guest."  She handed the man her grocery bag
"Thank you lady. Thank you very much!"  "Yes, thank you!" It was the
man's wife, and Ruth could see now that she  was shivering. "You know,
I've got another coat at home.  Here, why don't you take this one."
Ruth unbuttoned her jacket and slipped it over the woman's shoulders.
Then smiling, she turned and walked back to the street...without her
coat and with nothing to serve her guest.

"Thank you lady! Thank you very much!"

Ruth was chilled by the time she reached her front door, and worried
too. The Lord was coming to visit and she didn't have anything to offer
Him.  She fumbled through her purse for the door key.   But as she did,
she noticed another envelope in her mailbox.  "That's odd.  The mailman
doesn't usually come twice in one day."   She took the envelope out of
the box and opened it.

Dear Ruth:

It was so good to see you again.  Thank you for  the lovely meal. And
thank you, too, for the beautiful coat.

Love Always,
Jesus

The air was still cold, but even without her coat, Ruth no  longer
noticed.

If you love Jesus, send this to ten people.   Do not keep this message.

The mantra must leave your hands within 96  hours. You will get a very
pleasant surprise.

I  AM REQUESTING FOR THIS TIME OFF,   DEC.20TH , DEC.21ST, &  DEC.22ND.  MY 
FAMILY AND I  ARE PLANNING  A TRIP TO HUNTSVILLE.   

Thanks Lisa,
Prayer is so powerful, and you are such a blessing to all who know you.

  "I went to a party, Mom"

  I went to a party,
  and remembered what you said.
  You told me not to drink, Mom
  so I had a sprite instead.

  I felt proud of myself,
  the way you said I would,
  that I didn't drink and drive,
  though some friends said I should.

  I made a healthy choice,
  and your advice to me was right
  as the party finally ended,
  and the kids drove out of sight.

  I got into my car,
  sure to get home in one piece,
  I never knew what was coming, Mom
  something I expected least.

  Now I'm lying on the pavement,
  And I hear the policeman say,
  The kid that caused this wreck was drunk,"
  Mom, His voice seems far away.

  My own blood's all around me,
  as I try hard not to cry.
  I can hear the paramedic say,
  This girl is going to die."

  I'm sure the guy had no idea,
  while he was flying high,
  because he chose to drink and drive,
  now I would have to die.

  So why do people do it, Mom
  Knowing that it ruins lives?
  And now the pain is cutting me,
  like a hundred stabbing knives.

  Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom
  tell daddy to be brave,
  and when I go to heaven,
  put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave.

  Someone should have taught him,
  that its wrong to drink and drive.
  Maybe if his parents had,
  I'd still be alive.

  My breath is getting shorter, Mom
  I'm getting really scared.
  These are my final moments,
  and I'm so unprepared.

  I wish that you could hold me Mom,
  as I lie here and die.
  I wish that I could say I love you, Mom
  So I love you and good-bye.

 Subject: Empty Bird Cage
 
 There once was a man named George Thomas, a pastor in a small New
 England town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to Church carrying a
 rusty,bent,old bird cage and set it by the pulpit.  Several eyebrows were
 raised and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak...
 "I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy
 coming  toward me swinging this birdcage. On the bottom of the cage were 
three
 little wild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the lad and
 asked, 'What you got there, son?'"
 "Just some old birds", came the reply.
 "What are you gonna do with them?" I asked.
 "Take 'em home and have fun with 'em," he answered. "I'm gonna
 tease 'em and pull out their feathers to make 'em fight. I'm gonna have a
 real good time." "But you'll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What
 will you do?"
 "Oh, I got some cats," said the boy -- "They like birds. I'll
  take'em to them."
  The Pastor was silent for a moment. "How much do you want
  for the birds, son?"
  "Huh??!!!   Why, you don't want them birds, mister. They're just
  plain old field birds. They don't sing -- they ain't even pretty!"
 "How much?" the pastor asked again.
  The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, "$10,"
  The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten-dollar bill.
  He placed it in the boys hand. In a flash, the boy was gone.
  The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of
  the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting the cage
  down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars he persuaded 
birds                       out, setting them free.
 
 Well, that explained the empty birdcage on the pulpit, and then
 the pastor began to tell this story....
 One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just
 come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting.
 "Yes sir, I just caught the world full of people down there.  Set
 me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!!"
 "What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.
 
 Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun. I'm gonna teach them how
 to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to
 drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs
 and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!!"
 And what will you do when you get done with them?" Jesus asked.
 "Oh I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.
 "How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.
 Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll
 take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and kill
 you!!   
 You don't want those people".
 "How much??" Jesus asked again.
 Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all your
 blood."
 Jesus said, 'DONE." Then he paid the price.
 The pastor picked up the cage, opened the door and walked from the
 pulpit.

TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH...

If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down.

If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act=
=20
like soap opera guys.

Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short=
=20
hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married wome=
n=20
always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can
find the perfect present yet again!

If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what
we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

Sunday =3D sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.
Really.

You have enough clothes.  You have too many shoes.

Crying is blackmail.

Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work.
Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!

No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.

Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good
at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?

Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what
we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

Foreign films are best left to foreigners.

Check your oil.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments
become null and void after 7 days.

If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something
but not both.

Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials..

ALL men see in only 16 colors. Peach is a fruit, not a color.

If it itches, it will be scratched.

Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's=20
wrong. We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

What the heck is a doily anyway?
=02=05---------------------------------------------------------------------=
para Blondi...errr  Charlie:

ogle:  mirar codiciosamente o insinuante
doily:  tapete

Did Anyone Ever Tell You,
Just How Special You Are
The Light that You Emit
Might even Light a Star

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
How Important You Make Others Feel
Somebody out here is Smiling
About Love that is so Real

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Many Times, When They were Sad
Your E-mail made Them Smile a bit
In Fact It made Them Glad

For the Time You Spend Sending Things
And Sharing whatever You Find
There are No Words to Thank You
But Somebody, Thinks You're Fine

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Just How Much They Love You
Well,  My Dearest " Online "  Friend
Today I am Telling You

 ++++++++++++++++++

I HOPE I GET THIS BACK

I believe that without a friend
you are missing out on a lot!!!
Don't be confused by friends and
acquaintances, there is a difference!

Because I care about you,

It's national care week . . .
and you get to send messages to 
all your friends telling them 
that you care about them and 
make them feel good about
themselves and if they write
back . . . (just once)
then that means that they care
about you too.

BUT, you have to send it right now!!
Send it to everyone you care
about and if they send it back . . . 
that means they care too.
but don't just send it back,
send it on to everyone..

Have a nice day, and I'm glad we
are friends!!!

Nostradamus'  prediction on WW3:
       "In the year of  the new century and nine months,
       From  the sky will come a great King of  Terror...
       The sky will burn at  forty-five degrees.
       Fire approaches the  great new city..."
       "In the city of york  there will be a great collapse,
       2 twin  brothers torn apart by chaos
       while the  fortress falls the great leader will  succumb
       third big war will begin when  the big city is burning"
       -  NOSTRADAMUS
       He said this will be  bigger than the previous two.
       2001 is  the first year of the new century and this is the 9th  
        month.
       New York is located at the 41st  degree Latitude.

STEVE HERE'S THE AGENDA FOR LAS VEGAS!!

 

Hey guys and girls, we will be having our monthly meeting on Thursday Oct. 18.  Please bring any questions and concerns to the meeting.  The schedules for November and December have been set.  I tried to be as accommodating as possible.  If anyone has a scheduling conflict along the lines of vacation or needing some time off, try to switch out with someone first.  If no one will switch out with you please see me or don.  If you wanted to work some holidays and I wasn't able to get you in, talk to Don or myself.  That is all!  See you on Thursday.  

p.s.  Powermart is next week, I encourage everyone to get out to the parties at night.  See Don or myself about what day and time for the parties.

JAY I CHANGED THE SEPT. SCHEDULE.  YOU WILL NOT WORK THE LAST WEEKEND IN SEPT.  YOU WILL WORK MON-THUR.  FOR THE LAST WEEK.  I DID THIS SO YOU COULD GET THE EXTRA WORK DURING THE DAY SHIFTS.  THAT IS ALL

Hey guys and gals our problems with pjm #'s has been cleared up at last.  A spreadsheet has been set-up to give us pjm #'s.  Its located in M:/ELECTRIC/24HR/NIGHTSHIFTDATA/PJMHOURLY.  The northeast guys will import their numbers into this spreadsheet everyday before they leave.  Our group will be responsible for the evening hours.  Please keep track of these when you come in to work the evening shift.  This procedure is temporary until the northeast guys start their 24 hour desk.  The start date for the northeast guys will be Nov. 1.  That is all!

Rika can you give our shift people access to the east power portal.  They need access for the pjm summary #'s.  Thanks

rika, i forgot one person.  dean.laurent@enron.com

mike, thanks for letting me know.

 Juan,

FYI . . .  Joe and I swapped days, Joe picked up Nov 4 and I picked up Dec 14.  I know you don't care but I wanted to let you know.  The schedule has been changed to reflect this.

Seely

Attached is everything that you would want to know about our customer outin=
g
this week.  If anyone has any problems with hotel rooms or anything else,
let me know.  Those of you that are coming in on Thursday, please make sure
that you have told the Sheraton on Highway 280 so they will hold your room
for Thursday night.  Please pass this information along to your co-workers
that are coming because I did not have everyone's e-mail.  The golf course
is over an hour away from the golf course that we are playing at so allow
plenty of time to return for those of you that are returning home Thursday
evening.  We will understand if you have to leave early but we should be
O.K.

Kurt at AECI showed AECI purchasing 96 mws at $38 for HE 9.  The P&L showed this deal at $40.  I offered to meet in the middle at $39.  Kurt preferred to pull the tapes and review the deal with his day guy that did the deal.  This is a heads up on the situation.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen

Congrats!!!!!  That is one good looking baby!!!!  Let us know when  we can come over to check him out.  

p.s.  i'm bringing brewski's over for rob!!

FW:  A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY!
 
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
 
1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.
2.    When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name.
3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.
4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.    It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.
11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.    Someone else says  "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.
14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.
18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.
21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior.
22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.    It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.

OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR ENRON KIDS' CENTER IS UNDERWAY!!!

Want to be closer to your child during the workday?  Want to read to them at lunchtime or just give them a hug?  Then consider enrolling your child in the Enron Kids' Center.

Enron Kids' Center child care facility is currently under construction and will be located on Louisiana Street, across from our corporate headquarters in Houston. Enron is partnering with Knowledge Beginnings, one of the leaders in the child care industry, to provide high quality, conveniently located, customer service-oriented childcare for Enron employees in Houston. 

Anticipated opening date:	September 2001

Hours of operation:		The center will be open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM - 6:30 PM. The center will be closed on all Enron holidays. In addition, special "parents' night out" care will be offered for occasions such as holiday shopping and night out at the movies for an additional fee.

Complete meal service:	Your child's breakfast, lunch and two snacks are included in tuition. Infants will need to bring their own food until they are ready for "table food".	

Eligibility:			Regular full-time or part-time Enron employees who are the parents or legal guardians of the child or children named on the application are eligible to enroll their children in the center.  Temporary employees, contract workers and non-custodial parents are not eligible to enroll their children in the child development center.

Laura

1) They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army, and r=
ed ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their=
 urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the feelin=
g the entire school was built to spite UT.=20
2) Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passe=
d legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsi=
diary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agri=
culture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from where=
 they get that I don't now......the fact is, the State intended A&M to be a=
 branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth from the original creation. Lik=
e Danny Devito in "Twins".=20
3) So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must devote =
their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good. Al=
l the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they won't =
shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how they want=
 to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how =
bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is the world's=
 largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in everything A&M d=
oes.=20
4) The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at A&M=
. There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp. East Texas=
' answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never l=
earned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now, forget=
 the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if t=
hey agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Ge=
stapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget =
the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed a=
gainst them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past mo=
nth have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member wh=
o apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy. Not=
 only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-sh=
aven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point i=
s: We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however, no=
body respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of th=
e military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act lik=
e the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect th=
ese clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is on=
ly supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat u=
p civilians, move to Israel.=20
5) It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national telev=
ision and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands =
at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be agains=
t the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to mount=
 each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime anyth=
ing good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start s=
ucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down upo=
n. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have moved the g=
ame from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging on the=
ir turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boy scout is=
 tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's Thanksgiving dinn=
er. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your=
 woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls are=
 in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget ma=
ke-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil.=20
6) "t.u." is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if fo=
lks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be funny=
. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it. Please lea=
rn.=20
7) You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of shee=
p, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall down. =
Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit whooping =
in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoym=
ent of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yel=
l. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for Governor. W=
hen you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form asks for your =
phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3", Weight 185. Just, colle=
ctively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East Texas, tour every smal=
l town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade education why they cheer fo=
r A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base. This is why you are perceived=
 by the educated masses as stupid.=20
8) Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder, the=
y might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. Th=
e point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about ma=
rching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school =
band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then and no=
body cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do ca=
re. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college?=20
9) Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only =
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an a=
nal probe. Oh wait...I understand now.=20
10) Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat the=
ir own feces and should be treated accordingly.=20
11) Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that =
it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there. That=
 should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get an=
y better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending "D=
ukes of Hazard" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to A=
ustin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open mi=
nded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace an=
d final resting place of all that is cool. As my friend Stephen Johnson onc=
e said: "If the world were ever to get an enema, College Station is where y=
ou would connect the hose." If you go to school at A&M, please don't be an =
Aggie.

Johnny, Don and I have interviewed James and he looks like a very good fit for us at this time.  Can we get the paper work started on making an offer.

We should be checking trans. into Florida on a nightly basis.  You should look at the JEA, FPL, FPC and TAL sites.  Look for any trans available for next day on a hourly or daily basis.  Let the morning guys know of any availability during the morning hand-off.  And on the weekends look for it during the days.  If you see that trans is avail. for Monday on Sunday night give Miguel or myself a call(Before 11:00 p.m).  That is all

I recently faxed you a power of attorney for execution on behalf of Enron 
North America Corp. - however the meeting is now to be on 11 Dec to take 
place after a change in Italian law (so resolutions can be approved by notary 
only and don't need to go to court).

As the dates have changed can you arrange for execution of this power of 
attorney instead - merely the dates have changed.
Sorry for the inconvenience - if you need an initialled copy please let me 
know.

Many thanks
Mike

Robert,
 I confirmed with the Transportation Desk that the designation "TETCO M3" is 
a zone designation that includes all points within the zone.  Therefore the 
language "and all downstream delivery on the M3" is not needed.  Please call 
if you have any questions.

Hi Stacy -

Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline 
location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing 
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.

Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the 
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

Rob

Sorry that I have been tied up recently and I am e-mailing this to you
because I misplaced your phone number.  In any event, we are involved in
some contractual price reopener discussions with Duke under our supply
contract with Duke.  In connection with those discussions, Duke has made
certain information requests which we are obligated to respond to.  These
discussions will ultimately lead to an arbitration.  One of the requests
relates to our downstream sales of the gas which ultimately goes to FPL.
If you need more information or would like to discuss this further, please
contact me at 713-853-6911.  Thanks again for your help.

Jeff,  When I asked Tony Altmann to sign the letter, he asked for more

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation 
indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent 
might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the 
recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I 
promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe.
Many thanks for your help.

apparently the notary is not going to raise problems but he is not going to
register the deed in his books until he receives the original of the proxy
(the unanimous consent can be attached to it later although it will be
mentioned in the deed).
When do you think the courier will be here?

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=
.

Thank you.

Ruth:

In follow-up to our telephone  conversation,  I am confirming that it is my 
analysis of the purchase agreement between CES and ENA that ENA must refund 
to CES any transportation refunds it gets relating to the CES transportation 
contracts that relate to activity prior to January 1, 2000.  Likewise, if 
there are costs relating to such contracts prior to January 1, 2000, those 
are the responsibility of CES.

I hope this helps to clarify the situation.

Mark:

I am not aware of any of these type contracts.  I do know that we are at 
times suppliers to the types of businesses listed.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts 
as described below by Sharon Butcher.

"The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

Jill:

You are right.  Once this is assigned it cannot be used by ENA.  If everyone 
is fine with that, then there should be no issues.

If it is OK w/ Legal, then it is OK w/ me. The only question I have is that 
if we assign it to ENA Upstream, can they still do business w/ ENA..? (That's 
why we were doing a new one anyway...plus I don't think the old one had our 
riders)..., but again, if it is OK w/ you, it is OK w/me!
Jill,

Bob Walker has informed me that Pioneer has requested the existing GISB with 
ENA be assigned to ENA Upstream.  The GISB at issue was acquired from 
Columbia Energy Services.   In light of this there would be no need for a new 
GISB with Pioneer.  

To date,  Pioneer is holding final version of  our GISB.

Brian:

I had an opportunity to review your draft letter.  My thoughts are as follows:

 1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price 
alone.  I might make some reference to discussing potential commercial
      resolutions to avoid the reopener.

 2.  You make a reference in the letter to "GSA".  I do not think that is 
defined anywhere else and probably needs to be.

Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to 
finalize this with you.

Thanks, Jeff

We have been asked to provide an electricity contract form on a rush for 
Walmart.  Have talked with Mike Smith and we plan to use the Master Electric 
form that Mike is revising and plans to send to business team tonite.   The 
deal for Walmart is electricity only in CA right now, but will probably 
expand to other states later.   Angela Schwarz wants to have the form of 
contract agreed to and ready prior to having the transaction/price terms 
agreed to.  Jeff,   I plan to take Mike's latest version of the form tomorrow 
and revise that (including incorporating some of Walmart's comments on the 
gas deal that Marianne Castano was working on separately) and get it out for 
review by you, Mike and the business team, and will hope that we can get the 
draft form to Walmart in the next 2-3 days.   If y'all want to meet about 
Walmart we can, otherwise I'll plan to do this via phone and email.  Thanks,

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Attached is the interconnect data sheet for Athens.  You and Raimund may want to update it for site specific criteria that has been identified since they changed the power plant site point.

 

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

We still need to figure out how to true-up the origination $ from estimated production to actual production.

Nelson & John,

Terry Franklin has prepared an Appalachian Estimated TCo Metered Production for Nov 01 schedule which she will provide you.  This represents our attempt at calculating the origination dollars (at TCo Index + 1/4 cent) attributable to the TCo Metered Production.

I'm not exactly sure how to create a transfer from John Hodge's book to the Wellhead book for these dollars ($14,981).

Terry will also provide the same format to capture DTI metered production origination.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.

Ruth should get the Cove Point info.  Since Williams now owns the terminal, Columbia has less and less to do with Cove Point activity.

John, any idea who should be getting FERC information on Cove Point?  Could I use the same distribution as for Columbia Gas?

 

Attached is the spreadsheet we discussed.  I'll get with you to start collecting the June info.

I was able to obtain copies of the petition, utility order and other
pleadings in the Bethlehem case via the court's internet site.  I would
like to see the contract(s) that ENA has with Bethlehem to determine
whether there is any basis to deem ENA a utility for purposes of section
366.   For our conflicts check, I need to know which Bethlehem company(ies)
the ENA contract is with.  As far as I see in the motion, only ENA is
listed as a utility.

Interestingly, in the motion, the debtor states: "Nothing contained herein
shall constitute an admission by the Debtors that a listed entity is a
utility entitled to the protections afforded by section 366 or any other
provision of the Bankruptcy Code."  Indeed.

Nevertheless, for the time being, the order does prohibit the "Utility
Companies," which definition includes ENA, from altering, refusing or
discontinuing service to, or discriminating against, the Debtors. While
arguably ambiguous as to whether ENA is rendering a service or whether
closing out the contract is discrimination, prudence dictates complying
with the order until we get it changed.

What I'm thinking as far as strategy is that if we conclude that the
contract is a forward contract, we try to convince Bethlehem's attorneys to
remove ENA from the list of utilities and amend the motion and the order
accordingly.  If they don't and the dollars involved in closing out the
contract are significant -- bearing in mind that the order "authorizes" but
does not direct Bethlehem to pay postpetition invoices for services
rendered by the utilities -- then we move for a declaratory judgment that
ENA is not a utility within the meaning of section 366.

Regards.

Here is a confirmation that I have played around with and added some appropriate wordng like I would add if I were doing a deal that involved 10 percent or 20 percent swing, differernt  pricing, etc.  

I don't think I have ever had a deal where we had different pricing involving the swing language, so I made one up for you.  Let me know if this helps.

No economics or overview/summary, but I would talk to Brad McKay about the basis.  In the past we have valued Leidy at CNG North in the summer and Tetco M3/Transco NNY Z6 in the winter, but Brad has probably refined this by now.  Gas Daily has suggested that they will come out with an index for the point starting this November.  However, they still don't know what liquidity the point will bring.

John,

I met with Con-Ed last week.  They asked if Market Link @ Leidy was going to be good liquid point to buy long term supply.  I told them that I didn't think so but would do a little research for them.  I know you worked pretty hard on this one.  Do you have an overview/summary that  I could look at including some rough economics.

Please respond to ice so that they can nix the deal and the commissions.

Looking at the entire transport curve was very beneficial.  They have definitely tilted the majority of costs for most areas to the Dec - Feb time frame, which is representative of this type of retail market.  On average for the season and/or the year, the transport costs are reasonable.  Let me know if I can provide any other help.

John--
Thanks so much for the information you provided to me yesterday.  It was most helpful (although I have to tell you that the people here defended their prices and still feel they are appropriate).

Anyway, since we are trying to move them toward a "market based" approach to the valuation of capacity (rather than an average cost of what they have paid), I would appreciate it immensely if you could look at the attachment and give feedback.  The attachment shows a one year transport curve for each of the various zones/market areas where EES is currently doing business.  Hopefully this will give you a better picture of what they really have in their system, and help resolve or dispute their argument that the shape of EES' curve justifies the fact that they may be off in just the one month of data that I gave to you yesterday.

I'm trying to finalize COH's curve validation early next week, so let me know if you can get to it by then or not.  By the way, this would be much easier if you'd just come to Retail and do the transport here...!!!

Thanks again for your help

Still talking to Sequent.  We worked with them on Ford and U.S. Gypsum for =
the release of 7000 Dthd like last year.  Trying to get Sequent to finish a=
 2000 Dthd peaking deal with Ford.  Only working with Sequent on these two =
customers, especially in light of Ed's second suggestion.

status?

John,
I have reviewed the contracts (Asset Agreement and the GPA) and here are my=
 thoughts regarding your request.  In short, the agreements do not specific=
ally address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right=
 to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we=
 did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take re=
leases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he wa=
s going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. n=
ow), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load gro=
wth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because=
 he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considerin=
g the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect =
on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heav=
ily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter=
 (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done r=
ecallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit =
sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.

My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the de=
liverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talki=
ng to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequ=
ent is VNG's asset manager. =20

Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as we=
ll.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questio=
ns, please ask.

Aiysha,
I can only quote you firm volumes for COH 5-2 through 3/02.  Does this do anything for you?

John,
Do you think you we be able to submit a quote for the facility behind COH 5-2  and/or the facility behind COH 7-3.  I am hoping to have all responses in by tomorrow morning and then, make a decision.  I hope to hear from you soon.  Also, if you did not receive the load profiles on these two facilities, I have attached them below.  Reminder:  They are looking for firm supply to the gate at a NYMEX based price.

The RFP is due to NDR this afternoon/tomorrow morning.  If you could please provide me with the appropriate language to include by this afternoon, I would greatly appreciate it.  Also, should I enclose a copy of our master agreement and/or a resale agreement with the RFP?  Please advise.

Thanks in advance for all your help.

Lindsay:

	I have looked at the material and it seems backwards to me.  I think that instead of ENA being assigned the contract between NDR and MichCon that MichCon should be assigned the supply contract between NDR and ENA.  In other words, ENA should not step into the shoes of NDR, MichCon should.

	Also, I have attached a copy of our sample Master Agreement.

Thanks,

	Here is a transmission tariff with service agreements.  Andy asked for this.  

Jeff

Attached is a FERC proforma tariff.  However, each transmission provider will have its own version approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and it could contain substantial changes.  Also, the ISO tariffs are quite different and have numerous other rules. 

Stacy:

	Please send me copies and I will see what I can figure out.

Hi Jeff,

I was cleaning off the desk of one of my coworkers who was laid off and found two letters from KeySpan that she had not handled.  They were both from Charles Daverio, KeySpan Utility Services LLC as agent for The Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  One letter is a termination of a master agreement between ENA and The Brooklyn Union Gas Company, dated 12/01/88, with the termination effective 10/31/04.  The other is an alternative contract quantity election effective 11/01/01 for a master agreement dated 12/08/88.  I cannot locate either of these agreements in our system.  KeySpan Utility Services LLC, as agent or otherwise, is not set up in the Global Counterparty system at all.  None of our Brooklyn Union agreements even come close in date to the ones referenced in these letters.

In light of our current situation, I wanted to check with you to see if you knew anything about either agreement being referenced.  I certainly do not wish to call the counterparty and it probably does not even matter at this point.  I do plan to send these documents to the file room, but without a contract number to file them under, the file room will not know what to do with the documentation.

Please advise.

Thanks,

	Thanks for the note.  Things are pretty crazy around here, but it is clear that lawyers will be around here for quite some time.  Anyway, hope all is well with you.  My bright note this fall was the Buckeyes win over "the State Up North".  Give my best to your family.

	Have a great holiday.

Jeff,

I imagine you're quite busy these days. Hope everything's okay. Things

	The above is an entity that does a lot of gas purchasing.  It has not yet been put into bankruptcy.  Given the various payments that have and will not be made, I think serious consideration should be given to filing for this entity.

Jack,

Thank you for the letter.  I have added some detail regarding Phase VI and the fact that capacity shortages for SE Florida begin around Station 20.  In addition I would like to delete the last sentence of the last paragraph.  Please take a look at these changes and revise so that you are comfortable with them.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-0433.

We are meeting with Florida's DEP tomorrow and would like to present this letter to them at the meeting.  Therefore, I would like to get a copy of the letter on your letterhead later today.  

Best regards,

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Tanya:

	This is what was sent over by Duke.  I will be reviewing it later on, but let me know what credit provisions we would like to see.  

Jeff

Jeff, this Agreement should replace the GISB and any other gas agreement
between the parties.  The collateral language is incorporated into the
document.  Also, with respect to the Collateral Agreement for Duke Energy
Merchants LLC ("DEM"), Duke would like to propose assigning all of the
Enron transactions with DEM into one Enron entity and then using the form
of collateral agreement submitted to ENA (with some tweaking to allow for a
Guaranty from Duke Capital Corporation) to cover the transactions between
the Enron counterparty and DEM.  Duke can present a list of companies which
it has outstanding transactions with if Enron would like.  Please let me
know if you have any questions in this regard.  Thanks - Joe

	The change on the physical gas contracts was made in August, 1999.  I hope this is of some help.

Jeff

It is my understanding  that during the evolution of our physical power and natural gas contract forms, there existed forms which provided only for one-way payments (defaulting party receives nothing even if 'in the money' at termination)...It has become critical that we do due diligence on an  expedited basis to identify those one-way payment contracts....based  on a "down and dirty" due diligence effort.. Thus, can you please have someone in your group identify for me the month and year which we changed our forms to provide for 2-way payments.  This will enable us to make a "rough cut" of those contracts which cannot be included  in various asset baskets.   Thanks for your prompt assistance   bng

FYI
I am at 713-876-9977.  I'll call you after I've read the changes.
 
thanks

I will be meeting with the Texas land office on Thursday morning and would like to send them the attached tomorrow for their review prior to the meeting.  The attached is a Letter of Understanding (drafted by me based on your prior letter of understanding).  It is specific to the Kathleen Ann storage field and includes the current owner of the field as a third party to the letter. 

If at all possible, I would like you (or your designee) to review, modify and resend to me so that I can send it to the land office tomorrow.

Thanks,
Brian.

For your review.

Jeff, I have attached a marked copy of the Gas Agreement for your review.
I have tried to identify all of the changes I made to ENA's suggested
language by highlighting them in yellow.  Please note there were a couple
of additional changes which I made to the contract which reflect a new
Credit Policy which was passed by Duke's Policy Committee within the last
week and a half.  These changes can be found in a change to the Gains and
Losses definitions in the Agreement as well as a change in the treatment of
LCs  in 8.3.  Please call me once you have had an opportunity to review
these changes so we can discuss the changes and finalize the Agreement.
Thank you for your help in this matter, Joe

Mark:

Thanks,

Jeff

Alan:

	Obviously, we would be willing to enter into a Master Agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron.  At this point in time we would not be willing to enter into a GISB as we would prefer working under the GTCs until the Master is hammered out.  

	If you can get credit to get us the appropriate information, we can prepare the master.

Jeff

In negotiating the cross-affiliate master netting agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron, they have inquired as to our willingness to enter into a Master Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement for US and Canada gas trading, respectively. Currently, we are trading under GTCs (online and offline). In the interim, they have also asked if we would willing to enter into a GISB to replace working under the GTCs.

I'm not really sure why we haven't gotten a master agreement in place with J Aron in the past other than neither party was focusing on the necessity of doing so. Your recollections/thoughts going forward?

	This is the project I was talking about.  Let's get together and talk.

Jeff

Jeff,

I spoke with Stephen Noe, Director at Duke Energy Field Services, today regarding Duke's evaluation of the Pluto gathering line.  He confirmed that Duke is still in the $14 to $15 MM range for the pipeline.  He did indicate that his original evaluation did not include abandonment costs in the figure he gave me over lunch several weeks ago.  He is posturing toward the lower end of the range.  However, he did indicate that $14 MM appeared to be minimum type valuation. 

Given that Duke's price for the pipeline is still in the range Enron that will consider selling the pipeline, would you please begin drafting the purchase sale agreement and the necessary assignments for the transaction.  Attached herewith is a document that you reviewed last week regarding the schedule and structure for the transaction.  If we could have draft documents for internal review by Monday November 26, I believe that we can complete the review and send draft documents to Duke on November 29th.  

If you have any questions or identify any material issues please give me a call to discuss x-33541.

 

Thanks  ... Kevin     

Ms. Alexander:

	At the request of Tanya Rohauer with Enron, I am forwarding you a form Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement together with a Collateral Annex.  I will start preparing specific documents for Williams, but thought this might be a good starting place.

	I would appreciate it if you could forward these on to all appropriate parties.  In particular, if I could get the name of your lawyer so that I could forward things directly to him or her, that would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks so much.

Please see the attached assignment.  Kim, can someone on your staff/Peggy's staff please identify/confirm these ECC deals? I do not see a problem assigining the ENA deals to ECC as they are current month deals that will allow netting of the purchases and sales.  Should not affect the PMTM which has a threshold in the contract.  Would like to try to finish up quickly. Please advise if anything CRM can do to help.

James,

I haved deleted those files.  Sorry for any inconvience this may have caused.  I think I inadvertantly created two new sub folders which I was unathorized to delete.

Keith

Keith,

I noticed that a bunch of files have been placed in the folder O:_Dropbox/West New Gen.  They appear to have been created by you. This is the folder that I designated as a dropbox and the entire westpower trading organization uses that folder to look up this report.  If you would like me to move my folder, I will, but it would involve a great number of people and I hope it would be much simpler if I could move your files to a different folder.  Thanks,

James Bruce	

Thanks for the e-mail.  I'm excited to come visit in Nov.  However, this "bring your wallet" idea doesn't fit well with my new "I'm a cheap-skate mode". Oh well, what's a few bucks...money well spent to hang with a good buddy London.

Neither Mike nor I have interviewed Scott before.  Our connection to Scott came through a very strong recommendation from our West-Power trading desk in Portland.  We are interested in Scott because his west power experience is directly related to the west gas market that Mike and I trade.

I don't mean to be a pain.  If this is unconventional, Mike and I will make seperate arrangements for Scott to meet with us.

Thanks

Mike Grigsby and I would really appreciate being two of the interviewers of Scott on the 29th if that's not to difficult to arrange.

Hi Keith,

Karen.

Jeff,

Lets make dinner plans to discuss this.....Just kidding.  While Scott was here, we arranged for him to be included in the Oct 29th Trading Track interviews.  This seems to be the best thing for him given that he really wants to become a trader.  Once in the program, he'll have 4 rotations (6 months each), some of these would likely be on the west desk.

Mike and I have talked and both agree that it makes good sense for Scott to join west gas given his experience in Portland.  However, the only hitch is that Mike cannot unilaterally decide to bring Scott to the desk.  He will need to negotiate this with the other desk heads and the program director.  This should not be an issue.

Keith 

Keith,

Just wanted to follow up with your group regarding the possibility of Scott Freeman working in your group starting in January.  Either give me a call or send me an email.

Thanks for talking with him last week.

Mike,

Following is a west fundies update.  We have not yet produced an abundance of finished product, but several great projects are in the development stage.  These projects are making nice progress even though it may not be visible to the casual observer.

PRODUCTION

This effort is being led by Tori and supported by both Jay and myself.  Gaskill's staff will be providing most of the manpower.  The concept is to design a model which takes a methodical and scientific approach in forecasting: (1) declines of existing production,  (2) increases due to drilling. 

Existing production

Using externally provided production data, we are in the process of dividing production into zones of like characteristics.  Each zone will be identified by: Basin --> Reservoir --> Formation.  Analysis will be done at the zone level to determine its unique depletion curve.  This curve will be extrapolated to forecast future production from existing wells.

New production

From rig count data (or completion data if we buy the more expensive database) we can determine which "zone" a new well is targeting.  Forecasted production can then be determined by applying a recent historical success ratio and the corresponding depletion curve identified in the preceding step.  The difficult component to forecast with great accuracy is future drilling.  Our current thinking is a calculation that considers forward prices, drilling costs (which are increasing since all the "easy wells" have already been drilled), and common required rates of return.

Unresolved

Determining the specific plants which will be affected by depletions and new drilling is an unresolved issue.  The reciepient plant for new drilling may be identified in public records or we may be able to use rig coordinates to determine the closest and most likely plant.  Depletions may be more difficult as I am unsure if the well data can be readily cross-referenced with the corresponding plants.

DEMAND

This effort is being led by Mat Smith and supported by Jason Huang and myself.  Our near-term goals are to refine the existing California model and to develop similar models for the PNW, DSW, and RM.

Jason Wolfe is facilitating data collection and interpretation for the PNW.  I will likely recruit Billianna to follow suit in the DSW.  Jason Huang is moving to Gaskill's group, however, he will still have some involvement in this project.  I still intend on recruiting an individual from the research group, but feel that it is best to have the other regions "framed" (ie: model built) prior to bringing that person aboard.  His role will be to refine our technique and mathematics.

Data collection and interpretation

Much of the needed data is already in place, however some work remains.  Our existing NWPL histories consist of a handfull of compressor flows; demand is calculated by subtracting the downstream flow from the upstream flow.  This "rough"  method works, but the downsides are: (1) this calculated number includes changes in line pack and therfore true demand is hidden; (2) we are forced to break NWPL into arbitrary regions determined by the placement of compressors.  Jason W. is working on collecting flows at every meter on the pipe.  This will afford a much more accurate reading of true demand devoid of linepack changes and significantly better regression analysis will result.  Jason is also looking at a more meaningful way of dividing the pipe into demand zones.

El Paso's system does not provide flows at individual meters, but we have recently discovered that several years of actual flows for pre-determined zones are available.  (Phoenix area, Tucson area, and El Paso City area).  Monique was working on uploading this data into our database.  I think Bilianna can pick up where Monique left off.

An ongoing process will be to drill into the various demand zones to gain a better understanding of specific drivers of that demand.  ie: weather sensitive load, industrial load and related economic factors, etc...

PNW, DSW, and RM regression analsysis

Two hurdles have prevented us from moving forward on this front.  First, the data collection discussed above-- this process should be complete within two weeks.  Second, our intention is to use Portland's power demand forecasts as a variable in our gas demand models.  Mat Smith needs to visit Portland to gain a comprehensive understanding of these load forecasts.  He has a trip scheduled for the end of October.

Provided things go according to plan, we should have "rough" models in place by mid-November.  At that time I will look to bring a research person aboard.

Don,

I wanted to bring to your attention the practice of EES traders transacting with ENA through our origination group. (At least in the SoCal basis which is the product I trade.)  This practice hurts both your business and ours as our marketers are adding origination.  EES incurs higher transaction costs and ENA may be losing out on deal flow because of inflated prices.  

We addressed this issue several months ago by requesting that EES traders call our trading desk directly.  Assuming it was solved, I had not given it another thought.  Unfortunately, I have learned that this practice has been resurrected.  It is neither my place nor intention to tell you how to run your group, so I am requesting that you put an end to it on your side.  We are committed to providing liquidity at market prices to your desk.

Sincerely,
Keith Holst 

Mike Grigsby and I wish to recommend Scott Freeman for the October 29th trading track interviews.  Scott has accepted an analyst position with Enron and will be starting full-time in January, however, he worked as an intern this past summer with West-Power Trading in Portland and comes highly recommended.

Scott's phone number is 512-294-7692.  Please let me know if you anything else from us.

Thanks,
Keith Holst

All,

Please mark you calendars, you  have been selected to participate in the  ENA Trading Track recruiting event Monday, October 29th , 3 pm - 7 pm.     If you are unable to interview on this date please advise.

A selection of you will telephone screen 18 external candidates, and decide whether or not they should proceed to the final round on the above date.    A separate e:mail will be sent in relation to this.

Any questions let me know.

Regards,

Tim,

We definitely appreciate any time that Steve is able to spare.  If you like, I will ask Mat coordinate his travel plans with Steve.  Also, if Steve made his rework documentation available, Mat would become familiar with it prior to his trip.

Keith

----Original Message-----
Keith,

The hitch here is that our demand expert, Steve Swain, is currently on emergency loan to the EES rehabilitation effort, and he's got a pretty tight schedule. I just talked to Steve, though, and he's willing to spend a day or two if we can accomodate his schedule. Also, he's put together some documentation on last year's major rework of the model that will probably make the time available sufficient to get a good understanding of what we're doing.

Tim
Tim,

Following our discussion in Portland, I reconfigured the structure of west gas fundamentals.  We will have a demand team, production team, and a gas transmission/storage team.  Mat Smith, whom you met last week in Portland, will attack demand and will be joined by an individual from the research group.

Since power consumption is a key driver of gas demand, I have two requests: (1) Will you allow us to use your load forecasts as variables into our gas demand models?;  (2) If you are alright with this, would you mind if Mat traveled to Portland and spent a couple days with your demand person to become more familiar with your process and assumptions?  Mat has been with Enron for about one year and holds a masters in engineering from MIT.  He has a firm grasp on our business and general mathematics and I am confident that he is able to learn quickly.  As far as security is concerned, Mat is bound by a standard Enron non-compete/confidentiality agreement.

Thanks again for your help.

Vince,

We are searching for an individual to join the west gas trading desk on a temporary basis to lead the development of a comprehensive energy demand model.  Mike Roberts suggested that a member from your research team might be a good fit.

Our vision is to develop a consumption model for the western states (WSCC) which merges factors from natural gas and electricity markets.  This model would consider but may not be limited to: weather, electricity loads, a generation stack and commodity prices (hyrdo, coal, nuclear, oil, etc...), electricity transmission across regions, and predictable non-economic behavior patterns.  This individual would receive extensive exposure to our commercial environment and would have significant support from team members on our desk.

Two members of our team have started this project and I am very excited by the scope and depth that can be achieved with your help.  Please let me know if you are interested.

Sincerely,
Keith Holst

John,

This is not a critical matter, but one you may want to consider when you get a moment.

Brent Dornier is an analyst who is moving back to Houston from London.  He has been invited to join the trading track program and was scheduled to spend the first rotation on the west desk.  I met him face to face in London a few weeks ago and think he is exceptionally strong.

In the event that we are cutting people from the team and Brent is overlooked I think you should consider meeting him yourself.

Andy,

Coincidentally, I will be visiting London November 9th-11th and thought I might visit Enron's offices.

I am unaware of Amerax's penetration into the UK energy markets, but they are among the top three in North America.  As far as brokers go, Scott does a good job.  He is straight forward and honest and consequently was getting the largest share of our business in the west.

If you are interested, I would be happy to introduce you to Scott during my trip.  My schedule is fairly flexible.

Keith 

Hi guys,

We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.

I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here.
He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe.

Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?

Many thanks

Andy

Sounds good.  I'll plan on arriving to the office just after lunch and follow your lead on the beers.

Keith

Keith,

If you would like to come in and see the office on the 9th I can sort that out no problem.
Scott was suggesting that you would be over, and that he would like to meet me with you at the same time.

Any interest in a few beers that night?

tell my dad something soon so he can decide.

Attached is J.Aron's request and their exposure to Enron.  Rita has not already found a suitable offset as she felt it was most appropriate to get our permission first.  PLease make go away.

Also, I received a similar request from David Dutch at Entergy-Koch.  Please call him at 713-544-5580.  Make this go away too.

Finally, find paper I put on your desk from Harrison wtih Sempra.

Margaret,

I do wish to renew my visa, however, the system has deleted your previous e-mail containing the questionnaire.  Could you please resend this and a list of other requirements.  I will turn the paper work around in 24 hours.

I am unsure how to respond to the following questions:

	6.   U.S. Alien registration number.....unsure what this is

	7.   Address outside U.S....................I have severed Canadian residency for tax purposes.  Can I answer N/A?

	11. Complete legal name and address of Enron affiliate......similar to #7.  I have severed all ties to Canada, including Enron Canada.

	Entire section on "Current postino abroad"....similar issue as described in #11.

Sorry for the inconvience this has caused.

Thanks
Keith

Keith:  I had sent to you on August 14, an email regarding the extension of your L1A visa. 

Please let me know if you wish to renew this before it expires on February 11, 2002?

If so, I will need you to complete the visa questionnaire form I sent to you and return to me with the required documents.

Please advise soonest.
Thanks

Keith 

Let's do it. The only time requirement I have on Friday is in the afternoon. I'm going to have to blow out of here around 4:00pm to catch a flight to Scotland for the weekend. The rest of day is open.

John,

Let me begin by recognizing that you are now entrusted to resolve issues that were not of your own creation.  I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.

The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been "trust the system until it fails you".  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.

From 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.

My situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have three responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; and (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year. 

Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.

John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.

Sincerely,
Keith

To this I have four responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year; and (4) Despite my expectation of zero bonus I have continued to work diligently (including nights and weekends at your suggestion) at rebuilding this team.

Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.

John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.

Sincerely,
Keith

We are really looking forward to having you on the team.  The new trading floor is awesome.  Feel free to take a couple extra days if you need them.

Keith

Keith,

I hope that you had a good time in London... Scotland was fantastic. I'm really glad that I got to go before I leave. Speaking of which, I received word from Karen Buckley that I'll be joining West Gas. I must admit, I'm pretty excited about it. I think that my start date will be December 5, although I haven't received any confirmation of that...

See you soon,

-Brent

Going to Scotland for the weekend....Why the hell are you moving back to Houston?  In 2 months you'll be going to Galveston for the weekend.  Anyway, I'm arriving early Friday morning and plan on reaching Enron around 1:00 PM.  If it works for you, lets plan on meeting around 1:30 PM.

Keith 

Let's do it. The only time requirement I have on Friday is in the afternoon. I'm going to have to blow out of here around 4:00pm to catch a flight to Scotland for the weekend. The rest of day is open.

Looking forward to seeing you.

-Brent

Brent:

Phillip Allen passed your resume to me.  I would like to discuss the possibilty of you spending your first rotation in Houston with Mike Grigsby and myself on the west natural gas trading desk.  I understand that you are a trading candidate and a rotation on the west desk would fulfill one of the program requirements.  I will be in London November 9th, please let me know if you can spare a few minutes.

Thanks

What would you think about me pulling a Darin and keeping my options open?  Pretty shitty?

F.U.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just kidding.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Too good!

John and I agreed that we would not send the letter at this time.

In reviewing the key items of your business review with Jeff Skilling, he had 
some issues with your new Broadband business.  Please provide me with some 
more detail as follows:

It was mentioned that we had spent around $13 million thus far on dark 
fiber.  How much of the resultant capacity has been sold?  Are we laying the 
dark fiber at risk?  In other words are we taking a long position in dark 
fiber.  What is our capacity situation today?

Do you have a business plan for this new venture..ie what is the anticipated 
capital expenditures annually for this venture.  Who are the customers?  What 
is the expected return?  What is the payback on our investment, etc.

Who approved the formation of this new venture and the capital commitment?

Anything else that will help me get a clear understanding of what we have and 
where we are going with it.

Thank you for agreeing to be a speaker at INGAA's Annual Security Analysts 
Conference, scheduled for July 12-14 at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado.

INGAA hosts this conference every year as a forum for the 25-30 top natural 
gas analysts to meet with CEO's and other industry leaders.  

You will be participating on a panel on natural gas supply, scheduled for 
8:15 to 10:00 a.m. Friday, July 13.  As a panelist, we would like to hear 
your views on the natural gas demand and deregulation, and you are more than 
welcome to join us for the entire meeting if your schedule allows.

You will be receiving a complete packet of material details from INGAA.

Don't hesitate to call me if you have any additional questions.

Congratulations on your new appointment to Enron wind.  I am forwarding

Dear Mr. Malcolm

I hope you could remember me.  I visited you with my colleague in November
1999 to discuss possible collaboration between Enron and Mitsui.  While we
could not identify any project which we can jointly proceed with, the
discussion we had with you at that time was very useful for us.

The reason for me to writing this now is that I heard from some people that
Enron is now considering sale of Enron's wind power assets (Enron Wind).
We
think that the Wind power will be more popular in Japan as well and we have
an interest in Enron Wind.  If you have any idea about status of Enron's
this effort, it would be very helpful if you could share some idea with me,
like price level Enron is thinking of and whether or not any actual
negotiation is going on, etc.

I will be travelling most of next two weeks and it would be very convenient
if you could e-mail me your response.

I have forwarded your memo to Mark Metts who is handling the sale of Enron 
Wind.  Mark will make the necessary contacts.

That is fine with me.  I would like to get this approved as soon as possible.

Thanks.  I thought it was a good time also.

I wasn't sure if you got my response to your email.

Doug:

Thank you for your e-mail updating us on the Ripley Campus Grand Opening 
events.    I have purchased a table at the Wednesday, April 11, HEART OF GOLD 
CELEBRATION  luncheon at the Wortham Center, and my wife and I will be 
attending.

However, I am unable to attend any of the other events due to my busy work

Tell Angela I look forward to seeing her at the HEART OF GOLD CELEBRATION  
luncheon on the 11th.

and I will be there.  I have no specific plans.

THANK YOU!  Sorry about the admin gaffe.

I think the best way to handle this is for you to get with Mary Joyce and her 
team and work out the details.  I think the last item may be of some 
concern.  If there are issues that can't be resolved between Mary and you I 
will gladly get involved.  Does this sound like a good plan?

No, there are still some left for later on in the month.   I'll get with 
Janice.

Have a great weekend,

are very nice, and I do appreciate the gesture.

Thanks again,

Tuesday works for me.

This should be the first major step to getting this done.  Let me know if I 
can be of help!

I am glad that your Mom is happy!  It means alot to me.  Sorry you are not 
feeling well.  I'm not either.  I have not felt well since I gave blood on 
Friday.  Talk with you later.

Dad

UNFORTUNATELY!! work totalled interfered with my plans to go to the Masters 
last weekend.  I was so mad I didn't even want to play golf.  I am over that 
now and would like to play this coming weekend.  I can play Saturday morning 
(need to finish by 2pm). or Sunday morning.   I will be out of town Wednesday 
thru Friday so just let Cindy know if anyone can play.

Have a good week.

Forgot about Easter.  I am not that religious either but no sence in taking 
chances.  Saturday is good.

Hello, Kimberly!   Stan is out of the office until Monday.    Can we wait 
until Tuesday to send out?    In the future, we should try to incorporate a 
bit more "lead" time on items like this  just in case Stan might be out of 
pocket, etc., which is the case here.

Cindy

   
	
	

This is a "thank you" to be sent out to all ETS - Houston employees on 
Monday, Nov. 13th.

For your approval...

Kimberly

I want to take a moment to say "thank you" to all the employees who 
participated in the ETS Food & Toy Drive. We plan to deliver 5 boxes of food 
and toys on Tuesday, Nov. 14, to the Downtown location of the Head Start 
program.

There are many people in the Houston community who need our help and support, 
especially during the Holiday Season.  Through your generosity, the Head 
Start Program will be able to help those less fortunate .

Thank you again for your kindness.

I am glad it made you happy.  That is very important to both Caron and me.  
It is nice to see you excited.  It made our day too.

Stan

If the sales representative from the Jaguar dealership calls please get in 
touch with me.  Have a good morning!

The Boss

Good morning. I'm at EOTT .  Talk with you later.

Stan

I would love to come and participate.  I think the best I can do is come in 
the night before and perhaps(?) attend the night game and then do the golf 
tournament the next day and leave after the dinner.  Talk with Dave about who 
I should be paired up with.  I would like to play with either him or Mike 
McGowan also.  Tell Dave he stood me up last year but it was worth it.

Probably replacing Ken Harrison with myself is the right movr.  Please go 
ahead and handle making the necessary changes.  Thanks.

I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of 
your proposed broadband project.  They aren't doing anything according to Rod 
who checked for me.  It seems to me that we need to do several things to 
either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a 
sale.  

1.  We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the 
transactions being proposed.  I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this 
issue.
2.  We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer 
or seller of Portland metro dark fiber.  If they want to be in this business 
wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a 
sale?
3.  A project of this size will take Jeff's approval.  The projected Phase I 
capital is above my threshold.

I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you.  Sound 
like a plan?

I am here.  I will leave the office about 2pm.  I'll see you this weekend.  
Good luck on your test on Thursday!

Dad

Would you please look into this and advise me as to whether we can do this.  
Also, Rod Hayslett is checking with Michael Anderson on whether Wessex would 
like to perform certain billing and payable functions for Enron Europe.
Danny McCarty
04/10/2001 08:47 AM
Stan,
          Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether 
Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales 
channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing 
services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew 
Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other 
possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with 
him when you are in the UK.

Dan

Who is going to put our presentation together?  I will give it if you and Bob 
feel that is the right thing to do but I just do not have time to put the 
presentation together.

Stan

Please advise

suggest?

Attached is a short memo on our selection rationale for the underwriting=20
group for a planned (mid-May) equity offering of about $130 - $150 million=
=20
for Northern Border Partners.  Some of these firms may be contacting you, s=
o=20
this should be helpful in fielding those calls.  With this group we are=20
attempting to balance our placement into firms that have substantial NBP=20
holdings (UBS Warburg, AGE) and diversify and expand holdings in other majo=
r=20
systems (SSB, Banc of America, First Union).  Please note that for the firm=
s=20
not selected, i.e. Lehman, Goldman and Merrill, part of our rationale was t=
o=20
hold these systems for a potential offering later in 2001 that could be=20
accomplished on a sole-managed basis for up to about $50 million.

Kelly:  As Ben requested, the underwriting fees are expected to be about=20
4.25% and the breakdown by firm will be provided when we have determined th=
e=20
allocations.

Let me know ASAP if you have any questions or concerns as we will begin=20
discussions with these firms tomorrow.

The following provides the rationale supporting the recommended underwriter=
=20
group for Northern Border Partner=01,s upcoming equity offering.  Please no=
te=20
that underlying the entire selection process is the fact that MLP units are=
 a=20
specialized product sold to a more limited group of investors vis-.-vis=20
common stock.  Thus, sheer underwriting bulk or equity league table positio=
n=20
of a given firm does not necessarily indicate the expected performance of=
=20
such firm in an NBP offering.=20

Lead Manager - Salomon Smith Barney
SSB controls an impressive retail distribution system that has a strong=20
appetite of MLP offerings.  The visibility of NBP within their system has=
=20
increased recently as their MLP analyst has raised his rating on NBP to=20
"Outperform".  SSB has served as a co-manager in past NBP offerings and has=
=20
performed well.  Furthermore, due to their comparatively small allocations =
in=20
these deals as a co-manager, we are confident that their system has=20
significant untapped demand for NBP units.

Joint Lead Manager - UBS Warburg (f/k/a PaineWebber)
UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were=20
conducted via the rapid placement (limited marketing) process, so they are=
=20
very familiar with NBP and provide very good analyst coverage.  While we ar=
e=20
still confident that UBS will perform well and place a large number of unit=
s,=20
their allocations as lead manager in our past deals probably soaked up a=20
great deal of demand for NBP units within their system.  Therefore, rather=
=20
than placing UBS in a situation where they would have to stretch to put awa=
y=20
a lead manager allocation, it was deemed prudent to slot them in the joint=
=20
lead role.

Co-Managers
Dain Rauscher and A.G. Edwards
Both firms have a strong mid-market presence and have demonstrated their=20
ability to place a significant number of NBP units in past offerings.  Thes=
e=20
firms have not participated in an NBP deal since 1997, so this offering=20
should generate strong demand.  Also, Dain Rauscher was recently acquired b=
y=20
Royal Bank of Canada, which provides commercial bank lending to NBP and NBP=
L,=20
so NBP will be able to leverage DR=01,s participation in future debt=20
transactions.

Bank of America and First Union
Bank of America has been a significant provider of commercial banking=20
services to NBP and NBPL over many years, while First Union recently became=
=20
an NBP lender in the March 2001 transaction.  Both have retail distribution=
=20
systems available which currently hold a limited number of NBP units.  Both=
=20
have participated in past MLP offerings, with Bank of America serving as a=
=20
joint lead for highly successful Williams MLP IPO.

Other institutions considered but not selected
Goldman Sachs & Lehman Brothers - Both firms support the MLP product=20
reasonably well and have demonstrated adequate coverage of NBP.  Their=20
systems are geared towards institutional sales and high net-worth clients, =
so=20
their breadth of distribution for MLP units is more limited as compared to=
=20
SSB or UBS.

Merrill Lynch - Historically, this firm has not supported the MLP product=
=20
despite its natural appeal to Merrill=01,s average customer.  Admittedly, t=
heir=20
new analyst has taken a more positive approach, but Merrill has not=20
participated in any meaningful way in several of the recent MLP offerings.

MSDW - NBP receives no coverage on the investment banking side and their=20

The following provides the rationale supporting the recommended underwriter=

Joint Lead Manager - UBS Warburg (f/k/a PaineWebber)
UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were=20

Co-Managers

Both firms have a strong mid-market presence and have demonstrated their=20

I go to Washington DC tomorrow morning returning on Wednesday evening.  I 
will not be in the office either day.  Do you want tickets to Astros game on

know you will do great this week.  You are always prepared.  Good Luck.

Good luck and thank you for a job well done.

If you need my signature you should get it by noon on Monday or it will have 
to wait until Thursday.

The Red Rock expansion needs to get  approval at the May 1st Board meeting.  
The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for 
approval . Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would 
recommend it to the Board for approval.  By this memo, I am requesting that 
Rod coordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.

I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee 
meetings.  If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we 
can decide who should do them.  It is my understanding that no presentation 
needs to be done at the Board meeting.  I will check with Jeff to see if he 
wants a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it 
himself.

The engagement letter was mailed last week.  If you do not get it by tomorrow 
please let me know.  Thank you.

Thanks for the update.  I agree that getting the past amount will take some 
time.

Thanks for the update.  Going to one of the power desks was a good move.  
Experience on the desk will prove very valuable in the years ahead.  I hope 
you made your Dad pay a premium for those peakers!  Stay in touch.

This looks fine.  Thank you

Hello, Joanne!    Congrats on your new responsibilities.   I don't know Bob 
Phillips and, therefore, probably won't be talking with you like I did when 
you were with Mr. Somerhalder.

I have enjoyed our chats on the phone and you were always very courteous and 
helpful.   Good luck, and maybe we'll talk again one day soon.

Thanks,
Cindy
 

  Effective April 20, 2001, El Paso Field Services will be
moving to a new location.  Please take note of the new information for Bob
Phillips and Jo Anne Sheriff.  For those of you outside of the company, you
might want to update our email addresses if you haven't already.  Our old
email addresses still work but I don't know how long it will be effective.

  Further, as of Monday, April 23 Emma Means will be John
Somerhalder's new assistant.  Her phone number is 713-420-4754.  She and
John will be located at the downtown office until they move in June to
Greenway 9.  She will provide the new information when the time comes.

This is a friendly reminder of this weekend's Theatre Under The Stars Event, 
of which you and your spouse will be sitting with Stan and Debbie Horton.

This 2001 Gala will be honoring The Humphreys Foundation and takes place on 
Saturday, April 21, at the Wortham Theater Center  with cocktails beginning 
at 7:00PM in the Grand Foyer, seated dinner at 8:00PM in the Grand Foyer, and 
a special dancing performance by the Humphreys School of Musical Theatre at 
9:30PM in the Cullen Theater.

This is a black tie event; valet parking will be available.

Have a great evening!

Cindy

Since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from 
Enron Wind would be no.  You might want to contact Condy Plson to see if the 
idea has any value to Enron.

I agree.  There have been way too many surprises from this group lately.

I will do whatever I can.  Joe is a real good person.  Besides I think you 
could become a very good regulatory analyst for us and Joe would be a 
wonderful teacher.  I hope everything works out for you  personally and 
professionally.

I have the tickets.  Invite some friends if you want because I have four 
tickets and no babysitter.  Perhaps your Mother would like to go.  Have a 
good day.  Sorry I have been so busy this week.

Daddy

Congratulations.  It totally made may day also!!  I was coming back downtown 
from EOTT and went down Westheimer.  When I passed the old apartments I lived 
in for awhile all the bad days came thundering back and I just about lost 
it!  So you made my day!  Thank you!

Love, Daddy

The letter looks good.  It is factual and correct.

Contact Joe and suggest that he meet with you while you are there or I could 
do it for you.  Let me know.

You should have a lot of fun working with my good friend George Wasaff.  He 
is a super person!!  This group has strong ties to ETS and creates a lot of 
value for us.  Good luck!!

I w3ill take them over to your Mom's or leave them with Debbie.  If they are 
not at your Mom's, they are at my house.

OK..

Hello, Sherri!    I just wanted to let you know that Stan is out of the 
office today on a field trip, but I will discuss this with him on Monday.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't
you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you
tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Stephen.Dyer@bakerbotts.com on 04/16/2001 03:49:59 PM
 We are starting on your drafting work now that we have received the
engagement letter.  We have a few questions that need answering, as follows:

1. I need David to send me materials on Morgan Stanley Trust Co. so
that we can properly designate the right entity by correct name, etc.  If
they have any suggested or required language for our documents, I need to
see that as well.  Finally, I need for David to confirm with Morgan
Stanley's fiduciary people whether Morgan Stanley can serve as a co-agent
under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney and whether there are any
constraints or limitations in doing so that would impact our drafting.
David can follow-up directly with me if that suits you.

2. I want to remind you to send me a photocopy of Caron's "old" trust
document, so that we may consider whether it fits the current plan and can
serve as a receptacle under the current plan.   Sending it out today

3. We talked about setting up Debbie and MSDW as co-executor and
co-trustees under your Will, with Caron as back-up to Debbie in that
position.  However, we are also going to create a generation-skipping trust
right away for Caron.  Who should be the initial trustee(s) of Caron's
trust?  Debbie and MSDW?  or Randy and MSDW?  or even Caron and MSDW?   and
who shoud be back-up?   Caron and MSDW 

4. You said that Debbie wants to name you as executor and trustee under
her will.  Who should be your back-up in those roles?  If Linda Wehring is
Debbie's back-up on Debbie's power of attorney, I would suggest that she
also be the back-up executor/trustee, but Debbie may prefer to name Caron.
It would be best if Debbie would name at least two successors after you.
 1.  Caron
 2.  Linda Wehring (alternate)

 That's it.  Please respond by whatever mode you prefer.  I hope
email is reasonably satisfactory for purposes of my asking these questions.
I tend to start with email because it is so non-obtrusive, but I'm happy to
do whatever you prefer.

Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No 
one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  
Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one 
of Lohitt's strong skills,

That is not the issue.  By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we 
would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo 
if the unit does not function properly.  The whole deal gets complicated 
since there is a design engineer. oerator and equipment manufacturer and we 
get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.  If the unit 
does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else,  I have 
seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.  Why do I want to take 
this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers 
gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo 
deferred over many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that 
kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also.

I waited to get you one until they worked out all the kinks.  See how 
thoughtful I am.

I assume you have taken care of this and Jim is available immediately
Robin_Border@eott.com on 04/20/2001 08:24:43 AM
As you heard Stan Horton say y'day, he will get Jim Davis cleared to work
on our TxNMx Quality Management Project pronto.  Jim, thanks for good
presentation and excellent footwork leading to it.

                    Jim Suttle
Jim Davis was advised Friday that he should not spend any development time
on the Jal project until it has cleared ETS planning group.   Jim will make
the tour Monday but will then be unavailable to us on this project until
this instruction is changed or the project makes it through channels.   Jim
indicated that he received this instruction from Rick Johnson and Mr.
Martin, (didn't get the first name).  Mr.  Martin reports to Phil Lowry.

Jim Suttle

Looks good to me.

The information should have been sent to you by now.  I was out of town last 
week.  Sory about the delay.  Email is a great way to comminicate on this.  
Thank you.

There is not much noted in the finished column.  An explanation or revised 
finish date would be helpful.  Is the report not up to date or are we falling 
bhind in gettin items completed!

I will call you tonight to catch up on the prom etc.  Orlando was ok.  
Nothing great.  By the way, DK, the twins and I will be in Florida June 30 - 
July 10.  When are you coming?  We will need to get plane reservations ASAP.

Good morning.? How are you today?? How  was Florida?? It was sweet of you to

Good morning, Stan.  I would just like to extend my appreciation to you again 
for allowing me to join you on the visit to the Wiggly Compression Station 
Friday.  
The main factors influencing my choice to join Enron were the laid back 
culture and the treatment of the employees.  Thus, it was wonderful to see 
the interaction between the Executive and Operational team.  

Sincerely,
Monica Hwang

I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less) 
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each 
Friday.  You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him 
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

If you are bored go work out!  That is time consuming and good for you.  That 
is fine with the credit card.  If you work out it is ok to go shop and put it 
on the credit card.  Just not too much.  By the way DK's birthday is April 30 
and the JJ's are May 2.  No one expects presents but it would be nice if you 
got DK a card.  She is taking your car in today to be fixed.

Daddy

Have fun at the game tonight.  My week is going just fine.  Nothing exciting
to report.  By the way, there is $50 at Mom's that is for you because David
flew home from here last night, and we had to order the ticket on the credit
card.  The ticket was $68.75 so he'll give you the last $20 next time he
sees you.  I hope that is ok.  You had said once that I could always use the
credit card for things like that as long as I paid you back so I did.  You
can either get it from Mom or wait till I get home and I'll bring it to you.
With all the prom excitement I completely forgot to give it to you before we
left - sorry.  Anyway, this week is pretty boring for me because I have
nothing due and no exams.  I'm glad to have a light week, but it leaves for
a lot of boredom and down time.  I may have to find something to do
like......SHOP!!!!!  No I'm just kidding - I wouldn't do that.  Well, I'll
talk to you sometime this week and have fun tonight.  I hope the rugrats
feel better soon for their sake and ya'lls!!!!  I love you!!!!

Friday is fine with me.

I can have this all finalized by Friday May 13.  Peggy/Stan - Let me know if 
you need it done sooner.  thanks, Aaron

I am ok with all of this.  When can we finalize?

Here's the updated spreadsheet based on Peggy's email and our understanding 
of the programs.

Peggy, Joyce's reason for requesting an exception for Mary Turina (front 
loading and increasing retention bonus or guarantee payment of sales bonus) 
is "Due to the special nature of the trading floor and the on-going need we 
have to retain people in this area"...here's how I see it

Factors:
(1) seems like Mary just went into that position...but, if she's already 
established a reputation and is being heavily recruited, then maybe a higher 
number on retention is justifiable
(2) she works 80% - i know that's not indicative of productivity, but it 
seems our flexibility should be worth something in the retention bucket
(3) she only has about $100k of unvested equity remaining
(4) as currently contemplated, Piro and Lesh would get about $250k (compared 
to $200k for Mary) in retention value - but this points back to (2) somewhat 
and potential internal inequity issues if increased values or exceptions get 
out

The most important factors are:
(5) the risk of losing Mary to a competitor and 
(6) whether that loss would significantly disrupt the sale process or ongoing 
operations of PGE
If these factors are, in fact, problems, then it probably makes sense to 
increase Mary's retention bonus.  If we get into front loading her retention 
bonus, then I'd want to get some strong non-compete and non-solicitation 
language in the documents.  The reason for front-loading the retention grants 
for Fowler/Miller is to provide some consideration/incentive for giving up 
"window" payments.

Peggy, if you still feel strongly about increasing Mary's retention bonus 
after reviewing my thoughts, I don't have a problem with $250k, but if we 
start to get into the $300k - $400k range or front-loading any portion, I'd 
like to get Stan's sign-off.

Aaron

Thank you for the summary Aaron, I don't think you misrepresented anything,
but there are a couple places that I have questions, or the amounts you show
are different than what I was expecting.
1)My records showed our last discussion around Lobdell showed his sales bonus
at $225,000. and this shows $250,000. which I am OK with, but if total dollars
are limited, I might need the $25,000. for some other individuals.
2) I had emailed before that Quennoz, Johnson, and Ryder were lower than the
last plan, although this was the 'old' retention  plan. I had propposed
Quennoz and Johnson going to $250,000., which gets them to previous level, and
Ryder to $225,000., and that Barnett would need an increase to keep equity to
$225,000. If $250,000. is too high for Johnson and Quennoz, I could probably
be OK with $225,000. for each of them, but they should be as high as Nichols,
and Barnett should also be as high as Nichols.
3)I had also had Joyce Bell ask you a question about Mary Turina, and payment
of sales bonus at earlier of sale or some timeframe like 2 to 3 years.
Probably what I'm really suggesting here, is maybe we need to increase her
retention, and decrease her sales or something like that, and a front loading
might work here too, with incentive to have to stay.   
Thanks for all your help and work on this Aaron. Please call if you have
problems understand my notes. 503-464-8401 
>>> Brown, Aaron (Executive Comp) 04/23/01 01:14PM >>>
Here are the numbers for the PGE retention programs.  

Stan, I've reviewed Peggy's recommendations for these programs (Retention and
Sales Bonus Programs) and they seem reasonable in light of the imminent
divestiture of PGE and our associated needs - let me know if you're ok with
the numbers.

Peggy, let me know if I've misrepresented anything.

I will be working with Kriste Sullivan (Enron attorney) to implement these
agreements and supercede the prior agreements.  We are hoping to have the
agreements signed and executed by May 13.

I am not aware of any other conflict with schedules.  I suggest we go ahead 
with the meeting.

Molly_Sample@eott.com on 04/24/2001 04:22:57 PM
As you are both aware, we have a board meeting scheduled for Thursday, May
10 at 1:30.  The Audit Committee is scheduled to meet at 11:30 that day and
the Compensation Committee at 1:00.  All meetings are at the Enron
building.

Walt has just learned that John Duncan, Dee Osborne and Ken Lay are not
available to attend any of these meetings.  This leaves two out of three
for the Audit Committee and just enough for a quorum on the board meeting.
Walt is looking at possibly scheduling the Comp Committee for the day
before, but will confirm his plans on Thursday and will notify you if that
changes.

I am telling you all of this to advise you that if any of the remaining
board members, being the two of you, Dan Whitty and Ted Gaylord, are not
available, we will not be able to have the board meeting.   Walt recommends
we go forward with the date as scheduled, unless either of you is aware

Glad you could make the trip.

Just wanted to say thanks for the opportunity to travel with you to Wiggins 
compressor station. I will look forward to working with your respective 
organizations around procurement, contracting and deal issues. I hope our 
paths will cross again.

The game was awesome.  Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.  Debbie 
said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of 
the 8th inning.  She said I never picked my nose once on camera.  Pretty 
good, huh.

Have a good day.  Talk with you later.  By the way, your car is done.  They 
had no problem removing the oil filter at all.  They only had to wriggle it a 
little bit.

Love, Daddy

Short and to the point.  No changes

Thank you.

Sounds good about the car and the horse show.  WHERE is David staying this 
weekend when he comews up.  I am not sure I approve of this.  What is the 
deal? Email me at home.

Yea I watched some of the game last night too and saw you there.  I was like
"Look it's Dad!!!  Cool!!!!"  Unfortunately there was no one here to tell
that to but it's ok.  I'm glad you had fun.  I ordered flowers last night
for Mom for Mother's Day and for DK for her b-day.  I hope that's ok.  I
didn't know what to get Debbie, but I know I always like flowers so I
thought those would be good.  I'm glad my car is ok.  Please thank Debbie
for me, and I'll thank her as soon as I get the chance.  By the way, I'm not
coming home this weekend because Mom didn't want me to drive home this
weekend and then turn around and come home again on Tuesday (reading days).
David is going to drive up here for the weekend, and we are going to go to
some of the Fiesta festivities around here and the big FiestaFest concert
here on Friday night.  I will be home on Tuesday night though after classes
and will switch back cars then.  (I'll be home Tuesday till Friday morning
to bring a load of stuff home and study.  I also wanted to be there for the
munchkins' b-day party - it is the first one and all.)  Thanks so much for
taking care of my car and letting me borrow the Beemer.  It's been nice
having it!!!  I hope you are having a great day and I'll talk to you
tonight.  I love you!!!
    Love,
    Caron
PS - Thanks for letting the horses go to Nacodoches last weekend.  Rose won
both the costume class and championship so she's qualified for Nationals in
that now, and Ricki won his driving so he's qualified now too.  Rose got 3rd
out of 6 in sidesaddle, but Jennifer said it was her and not Rose (fred said
so too!!).  I'll have to get that qualification in San Antonio.  I just
thought you'd like to know and tell you thanks for giving me some more
classes to ride at Nationals.  Maybe I'll actually win something there this
time around!!!

Stan + Mark,

as you are probably aware Enel is actively looking at acquiring water
businesses, particularly, but not only, in the UK .

They are also generally interested in opportunities in South America .

We are always looking at things that could attract Enel' s interest in
order to help us get our hands on some power and potentially gas positions
in Italy .

Moreover, Enel is cash rich and has proven to be a very generous buyer,
when it comes to acquisitions in areas of business ( gas, water and
telecoms ) that can help them to fulfil their vision to become  a multi
utility .

 I have got some decent contacts at the decision making level . Would you
be interested in discussing a potential approach ?

       R

I'm glad you could join us...sorry we weren't able to talk at the table.

Stan, thank you for inviting me once again to the Arthritis Fdn. annual 
event.  It was good to see you, but admitedly, even better to see the 
pictures of your babies.  They are adorable.  I know you and Debbie are very 
proud of them.

Thanks to you and Enron for participating in this worthwhile event.  Janice

Workout, study, study and then go shopping for something new.

Good morning.? I have absolutely nothing  exciting on the schedule for 
today.? I only have one more Tues/Thurs. class  after this one though and in 
b. law this should be our last class!!!? I  can't believe how fast it has 
gone by!!!? Have a good day, and I will talk  to you tonight.? I love you!!
??? Love,
??? Caron

Thanks rae.  Debra Peppers is persistant so Flashfind may very well join our 
organization.  $5,000 is good!

GISB1@aol.com on 04/25/2001 02:20:16 PM
Stan -

Both JoAnn and I have spoken to Henry Norton at Flashfind.  We both told him
that the best way approach GISB regarding his product was to consider
membership and certification if it applied, and to send in a request if he
thought that standards should be developed.

We also told him that our organization has been very receptive to requests
for standards development, and have only declined to process a handful of
requests because they were out of scope.  If he considered that the request
for standards would improve and streamline the marketplace for natural gas,
and that it met both the mission and scope of our organization, it would have
a good chance of moving forward.  Our plate right now is pretty full, as it
always has been, but that has never stopped a company from requesting that
additional standards be development.

We also told him we would help him to write the request if needed and looked
forward
to working with him in the future.  I am not sure that he will follow up with
us on membership, certification or providing a request which would go through
our normal process.  I will keep you updated as or if this progresses.

Best Regards, Rae

The GISB mission statement, as adopted by the Board of Directors, is:
"The Gas Industry Standards Board mission is to develop and promote standards
to simplify and expand electronic communications, and to simplify and
streamline business practices which will lead to a seamless marketplace for
natural gas.  These standards will assist the natural gas industry in
improving customer service, enhancing the reliability of natural gas service
and increasing the competitiveness and efficiency of natural gas markets."

Scope Statement
The GISB scope statement, as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation, is:
"The objects and purposes of GISB are to propose and adopt voluntary
standards designed to promote more competitive, efficient and reliable gas
service, as such standards apply to electronic data interchange ("EDI")
record formats, communications protocols and related business practices that
streamline the transactional processes of the gas industry."

Please send a list of corporate types who could act a executor.  I will get 
back ASAP.  Thank you.

Stephen.Dyer@bakerbotts.com on 04/26/2001 10:54:38 AM
David Hill put us in touch with Marco Crespi, who is at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter Trust FSB in New Jersey.  There is no local office of MSDW Trust, and
by local I mean in the State of Texas (not just Houston).  Marco assures us
that MSDW Trust has authority to conduct trust business in all 50 states and
is sending us evidence of same.  I am not worried about their authority to
do trust business here, but I am worried a bit about what I explain below.

Marco has informed us that, since MSDW Trust has no local presence, they
will not accept appointments to the more personal or high contact positions,
such as agent (attorney-in-fact) under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney
and executor under a Last Will and Testament.  Basically, all they take at
this point are trustee appointments.

This obviously puts a kink in your plans as outlined at our meeting in your
office on April 3 with David Hill and in our follow-up e-mails.  We have
rough drafts of your documents in process and expected to send you some
first drafts by mid-week next week, but all those drafts name MSDW Trust to
the various positions you had in mind, some of which we now know are not
feasible.

If you want to name MSDW Trust as co-trustee on all the trusts, whether
created now or under your Will, that will work fine.  However, you will not
very well be able to bridge the gap during any period of incapacity (under a
Power of Attorney) or during any period of estate administration (under a
Will) with another corporate fiduciary as co-agent or co-executor who then
is expected to hand off to MSDW Trust as trustee.  In other words, if you
really want MSDW Trust in there for the long haul as co-trustee on all the
trusts (both now and after your death), your best bet is probably to have
only an individual serve as agent or executor (say your wife, for example),
as those jobs are temporary, to bridge the gap until the trusts are fully
funded after your estate administration is completed.

If you have any reticence about naming only an individual as agent or
executor (again, say your wife), you might consider having two individuals
named together as co-agent and co-executor to ameliorate your concerns (say
Caron with your wife?).

Of course, if you want to shop around town a bit for a corporate fiduciary
who could and would serve as co-agent and co-executor, we can provide a list
of several banks and trust companies and introduce you to most in the city.

Baker Botts has no horse in this race other than you and Debbie, of course,
and we will not favor MSDW Trust or any other trust company, one over
another.  You favor MSDW, though, and I'd like to help you work out a plan
that uses them.

Please let me know your thoughts, as I know you are eager to put at least
some of this to bed soon, and Adam Schucher (here at Baker Botts) has
prepared first drafts that require only my review and revisions prior to
sending them to you.  It just looks now like there may be more revisions
than we originally anticipated.

Sorry for the news.  Please advise.  I'll be out today after 11:15 but will
be in tomorrow and next week.

As you are aware, we have been pricing an upgrade to our Computron financial 
accounting program.  The vendor selected was Axes-One, which is the new name 
for Computron.  To keep the project on target for implementation, we have a 
quote from the vendor that is good until May 1, 2001.  This is a budgeted 
expenditure and the license fees are approximately $300,000.

then either meet them with you or your people or send them information,

       R

I agree.  I suggest the following.  Joe, we need you to go give a pitch to 
Massey's assistats about what is going on.  Next Jerry Halvorsen has 
scheduled a lunch with Massey in two weeks.  He has invited me to attend.  
What do you think?

Steven J Kean
04/26/2001 03:09 PM
We need to communicate with Massey before he gets completely carried away 
blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes.  We need to 
get him the information regarding Cal LDCs failure to fill storage and their 
opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state.  Shelley -- 
could you forward copies of the LDC filings to the group.  Should Joe or I 
(or both) try to see massey when I am in town next week?
Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to "obscene" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

No.  The GP contribution is enough.  I don't want to go to Jeff for another 
$2 million.

It looks like our GP contribution will be about $2.5 MM.    Do you still want 
to get another $2 MM on top of that?    The second part of his message is the 
potential NB unit TOtal Return Swap, or monetization that we have been 
working on.

I did get your voice mail on the potential placement of $2 million in units 
with Enron and we're working that into things.  Our attorneys commented that 
the legal fees to accomplish that (when we have a public offering going on) 
may "chew up" the benefits.  But that is their normal reaction - I don't 
think there will be any problem in accomplishing the placement.  Most likely 
it will need to be priced simultaneously with the offering to avoid any 
perceived "insider" pricing benefit.  But - do you think that will cause 
problems internally on the DASH?  The GP contribution will be about $2.5 
million.  My concern is RAC will require the $2.5 million GP investment to be 
combined with the $2 million in LP units, which I believe will trigger 
Skilling's sign-off.

On the FAS 125 idea, we have a structure that has been proposed by SunTrust 
that I need to review with you and someone in EGF.  I was planning on setting 
that up after our road show is completed on about 5-17, unless that needs to 
be accomplished sooner.  Let me know about timing and who you think should be 
involved (I was going to raise this with Ben Glisan in the next few weeks at 
his staff meeting).

After giving it some thought I think just naming Debbie as executor and agent 
is the best course of action.  Debbie is fine with this approach.  Thank you.

I will be in attendance.

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in 
a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an 
unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check 
to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to 
these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% 
-  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

30 days is acceptable.  This is extremely important to us.

Susan Ralph@EOTT
04/27/2001 02:17 PM
You asked for a time line on securing this quote.  

I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of 
strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.  

Lou,  I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.  
As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier  with what I have to offer 
them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am 
strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.  

After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 
days..I will shoot for better than that.  I feel however that this quote/due 
diligence will be much more intensive on their part  given their experience 
with EOTT,  I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time 
frame.  Is 30 days acceptable? 

 Hope this answers your questions.  If not please let me know.  

We cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown.  I am looking to 
you to insure that one does not happen.

Rick Craig
04/26/2001 07:51 PM
Stan, thanks for the comments.  With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same 
attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.  I'm a little bit 
surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana 
the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.  Obviously something 
broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.  

Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told 
you that I don't have the same concern.  Phil and I discussed this at some 
length but since his work on the international side was winding down and 
Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his 
measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.  Don and 
I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship 
building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could 
handle it.  I plan to stay on top of it.  If I see the communications and/or 
relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal 
with them quickly through the performance mangement process.  Hope this 
answers your questions.  

    

Stanley Horton
04/23/2001 08:02 AM
Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No 
one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  
Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one 
of Lohitt's strong skills,

Thanks for the report.  The level of detail was on target.  Let me know when 
you want to discuss comp issues.

Adam_Umanoff%ENRON@eott.com on 04/29/2001 12:23:55 PM
1.  Aura.
     -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as "real."  UBS
will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's
expense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains
mixed.
     -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process
can be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists
seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.
     -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial
projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02
EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of
$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,
showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.

2.  M&A Activity.
     -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,
continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in
May.
     -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but
execution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greek
development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.

3.  2001 Commercial Activity.
     -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed our
projected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation of
suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US
wind regimes.
     -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the
two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);
indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty
of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with
EWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,
we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt
financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in
June.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt
closing.
     -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw
turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the
largest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very well
received.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss
IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent
infringement grounds).

4.  HR Issues.
     -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have
expressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss
with Horton early in week).
     -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global
procurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visit
hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed
oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit
for this position in the midst of Aura.

Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level
of focus.  Talk with you soon. Adam

Thanks for the report.  Just what I needed.

For Portland General Electric, week of April 23, 2001
1)Announcement of termination of Enron and Sierra Pacific deal was uneventful,
and not surprising to employees and Portland Community.
2)Time was spent in addressing questions from data room in San Francisco.
3)FERC ordered the Cal ISO to file by 6/1/01, a RTO proposal with FERC. At the
same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA)
to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that
addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for
creating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help prevent
California's efforts to balkanize their power system.
4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the
independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of

I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less)
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday. 
You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

Thanks,
Stan

I would like to pursue an offer to Mr. Shea prior to the next Executive 
Committee meeting on May 7, 2001.  Please forward your comments or questions 
by Tuesday, May 1, 2001 so that I can extend the offer by Wednesday, May 2, 
2001.

You will find attached the recommendation letter and his resume.

Regards,

John Lavorato

 

Tammie Schoppe on behalf of John Lavorato.

The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the 
Executive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being 
an Enron VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this 
process.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is 
not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the 
strength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception 
I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the 
exception being granted.

I would like to pursue an offer to Mr. Shea prior to the next Executive 
Committee meeting on May 7, 2001.  Please forward your comments or questions 
by Tuesday, May 1, 2001 so that I can extend the offer by Wednesday, May 2, 
2001.

I will leave Houston around 10:30 tomorrow, so lunch should be around 1:30.  
Then I am free for at least a couple of hours before I have to go to the 
Hyatt.  I will leave SA on Friday at noon if you want a ride home or if you 
want me to follow you.  I think however you leave earlier than that and thats 
ok.  I will be tied up the rest of the time there.  

Love, Dad

Thanks for forwarding Peter's resume.  By copy of this memo I am forwarding 
Peter's resume to Danny McCarty and Phil Lowry.  Danny and Phil: Please 
follow-up with Vince if you have an interest in meeting with Peter.  He seems 
to be a very qualified candidate.

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with 
Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor 
fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

Peter Percell <percell@swbell.net> on 04/30/2001 11:16:58 AM
I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

Almost done with your drafts.  Took me a little longer to review and revise
Adam's first drafts than I had thought (there's a lot going on here, as
you'll see soon).

I expect to send them out to you sometime tomorrow. Since Debbie is a client

I know of no changes we need to make to the Board or to the Committee

In advance of the May meeting of EOTT's Board of Directors, EOTT's sole 
shareholder signs a written consent providing for the annual election of 
EOTT's directors.  At the May meeting, the Board of Directors elects 
committee members and chairs for the next 12 months.  Are either of you aware 
of any upcoming changes in the composition of EOTT's Board of Directors?  In 
the past, we have had directors who have stepped down immediately prior to 
the "annual meeting."    Please advise me early next week as to whether there 
will be any changes to EOTT's Board of Directors in order that I may have the 
appropriate consent of sole shareholder signed.

Dan Whitty (Chairman), Ted Gaylord, and Dee Osborne are the current members 
of the Audit Committee.  John Duncan (Chairman), Dee Osborne, and Dan Whitty 
are the current members of the Compensation Committee.  Will there be any 
changes to these committees?

Attached is the final draft of the Midwestern acquisition press release.  
Please provide any comments to me by 2 pm tomorrow, May 4.  If I don't hear 
from you by then, I will assume no comments.

We are targeting a Monday, May 7 release before the market opens.

Thanks,

beth

Jim, thanks for the invitation.  I should know by Monday if I can make it.  I 
hiope that is ok.

Sounds like you are having a tough week with all the Exchange/Outlook 
outages.  Hang in there.  The problems will be resolved.  Also, we still like 
you!

Golf is scheduled for 2pm Saturday.  Lousy start time but evidently they have 
a tournament of some sort on Saturday morning.  Let me know if you can play 
or not.  It is only you and I.  Phone numbers are:  work 713.853.6177.  Home 
281.320.1240.  Also please email your phone numbers for future reference.  No 
one has them.

Thanks but I will pass for now.  I wouldn't mind looking at some muni's with 
shorter maturity dates though.  I am concerned about long-term yields 
increasing which would mean bond prices decreasing.  Doesn't it make since to 
go with shorter maturity dates ri8ght now?

The Muni desk called to say they are seeing a blip in the market and are
seeing  5 1/4% at par around 2021 to 2025. They think those rates won't
last.

They called about your portfolio because your ladder is is thin in those
years.

You have some cash. If you have an interest give me a call. I can fax your
maturity concentration schedule  to you if you need it. I didn't want to
send your portfolio info by fax  without your permission.

I understand.  Thanks for the update.

Go ahead and post the response to Gas Control issue,

It would be better if Scot contacted EBS directly about a meeting.  Kevin 
Hannon would be the right person.  Kevin is the President and COO.  I have no 
idea about whether they are in need of Spectrum's services or not.  Let me 
know when you plan to be in Dallas.  My daughter has a horse show (we own 
three Arabian Horses that she shows) in Fort Worth in mid June and I will try 
to get up there for at least some of it.

Stan;
I got your letter and company info, thanks. By the way, our President, Scott
Brown, is going to be in Dallas on the 16th and 17th of May making a
presentation to Worldcom. I thought I would check with you to see if any of
your people with Enron Broadband might be able to meet briefly with Scott on
the 15th (Tuesday) or 18th (Friday, which would be better) in Houston to
discuss our services. If they can meet just let me know dates and times and
I'll coordinate with Scott.

I still plan to be in Dallas to see Hugh King sometime in mid to late June,
and I will plan to stop down in Houston while I'm there and we can try to
get together. Thanks,

Terry

Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to 
attend the Indy 500.  My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to 
get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went 
to the races.  Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.  Leaving her 
to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.  Thanks 
for the invitation!

Stan,
Monday is fine.  We hope it works out, we would love to have you as our
guest.

Cheers,
Jim

Jim, thanks for the invitation.  I should know by Monday if I can make it.  I 
hiope that is ok.

I am on for golf on Saturday if anyone is interested.  Tom, can you make the 
T time?  Saturday morning early is better for me.  830 to 9.:00 am start

This is to advise you that we have canceled next Wednesday's ETS Half Day 
Staff Meeting.    Our next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, August 15, 
from 8:30AM to 1:00PM in 49C2.    We are taking a summer break to accommodate

Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns with this

Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet 
until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for 
planning purposes ASAP. 

Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even 
worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?

Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?

Have a good week.  Thanks.

Thanks for the report.  Anything you need help with?  Did all the 
compensation issues get resolved with Gary and you?

For your information.  I still think we can do better than this.

Stan Horton
Chairman and Chief Exective Officer

Dear Mr. Horton:

Thank you for your letter of congratulation on my recent retirement.

I would like to make a suggestion, for the retirement plan for others.

        When the 27 page retirement letter is sent, that a time table of
when items will be in place or transferred         be included. (3-9
months or when)

        Medical Forms can't be put in now until after you leave.  I went
back to the office to HR and they put         the information in the
system.  Two weeks after I left I called to see when I would receive the
card (Dr.         offices like to see the card).  I was tolled I wasn't
even in the system.  So I called back to Omaha HR         and they worked
to get it in place.  When I went to get a RX  I was not in that system
either and had to         come home and call HR and start over with that
system.

        The only part of the funds that are transferred as of this date
is the Cash Balance Plan.  The Savings         Plan and ESOP are not
transferred to my Financial Plan.  They tell me they will be; this is why
I feel           a timeline would be helpful.  Until I received my
Medical Card I put off going to the Dr.  Also I haven't         wanted to
take a trip because, I am unsure of when funds will be transferred.

         Last week I received a letter from a transfer Company out of NY.
with (2) shares of  ENRON                 stock.  So I called NY to see
what Fund that was from,  they didn't know they were just to set up a
    account.  I called the Enron retirement line and they didn't know
what Fund that was from either.

        Many of the people who answers the phones about any of this just
don't have answers.

ENRON employees have been well taken care of while we are working, this
doesn't seem like that in retirement.  I share this because I know your
are always working to improve ENRON.

Sincerely,

Jean Mohring

After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE 
business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand 
better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial 
exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy 
to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast 
of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and 
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

You and I need to sit down and discuss in some detail John Ale's contract and 
yours.  Let me know when a good time would be.

 thanks

Sorry I am unable to attend but appreciate the invitation.

Good morning, Doris!   Stan is in DC today but will be back in the office 
tomorrow morning.   Would you allow us to get you comments by 9:00AM tomorrow?

Thanks,

Thursday May 10, 2001.
Thanks

Peggy, that all sounds very goo.  I will attempt to get educated first and 
then we will set up a meeting.  Thanks for being so cooperative.

I agree that makes a lot of sense, that is certainly where we are spending our
time, and good management of that so far, is what is contributing to earnings
higher than expected....that and the crazy California markets. We're always
glad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's what
you would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the sales
presentations and have a number of overheads, and some written information
that we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with.
The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in right
direction. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads,
demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available at
reasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operating
under an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in the
near future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble are
those who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rate
increases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but not
just for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharing
mechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers and
shareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time working
through with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most like
it when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complex
and leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better for
shareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon will
not get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation,
and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including the
industrials that are  reliability sensitive like high techs and health care. 
Sorry for the long note....how about if I start by sending you some
information from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when a
meeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the banker
presentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and could
share with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thought
we might have another in a week or so.....

Matthew_Scrimshaw%ECT%ENRON@EOTT.COM on 05/09/2001 04:08:30 AM
Stan,

I met with Colin Skellet, Wessex Water CEO, last week and we agreed that
Wessex Water and Enron Direct should help each other going forward.  Wessex
will provide ED with its I&C database and, should Wessex decide to enter
into the residential power and gas market, ED could provide site
registration and gas/power price risk management services to sit behind the
Wessex brand.

Given that Wessex is Enron's biggest retail platform in Europe, have you
given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Direct
generally?  Given current market conditions, I expect Enron will have
little choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail
water and energy businesses together, though I think it is worth looking
at.  ED has 150,000 I&C customers across the UK, making it a good fit for
Wessex.  Also, if the Water market opens up to competition in the future,
there would be benefits for Wessex.

I look forward to discussing ideas with you when you are over in June.

Matthew

Just a reminder about tomorrow's meeting at the Houston Four Seasons Downtown 
Hotel from 1:00 to 3:00PM with John Somerhalder and others.   The meeting 
room has been changed to The Travis Room.

The dress attire for this meeting will be business casual.

It was so nice to hear from you.  I am glad all is well.  I am glad the new 
home is being enjoyed and that you have a job that you like.  I am anxious to 
get the news of the birth of your new grandchild.  Please let us know as soon 
as possible after the Geraldine delivers.  Also let us know what hospital she 
is in where we can send an appropiate gift to mother and child.  My best to 
you and your family.

Dear Stanley:
  Before hand I'll let you know that we are doing great back home at Down
Under. We have bought our new home and are enjoying it completly. We
receives the photos that you sent us of the twins and we must congradulate
you that they are absolutly beautiful.
  Please let us know how you and the family are doing. I'll let you know
that I'm working doing a small delivery job for a Bakers Factory, nothing to
do with what I was doing but I like it just the same. It's a very early
start but I finish before lunch and that gives me time to look for a part
time job in the afternoon. After I spoke with Paul in the meeting, he said
that he was going to introduce me to other companies from the field, but I
haven't heard from him since then. I won't lose my hope to work for Enron
some day.
  Geraldine is doing fine and has two weeks left before the baby's due,
Chris is doing very good at school and keeping up very well with his soccer
training and Vicky is doing fine also and very happy with what's going on.
Do you still watch Stock Car racing? Let us know how things are going
because we haven't got cable tv yet so we are pretty left out on sport news.
  Hope to hear from you real soon, here's my new address so we can send
letters apart from mailing.
         8 BENNISON ROAD, HINCHINBROOK - N.S.W. - 2168
              PH:(02) 8783 9273
  Our kindest regards for you and to the rest of the family and a special
kiss to the twins.

Dear Board Task Force,
Bill Boswell also noted the following conversation that occurred today:

"Rae -- and just to fill in the blanks, Betsy Moler called this morning to say
that Mike McGrath had called her seeking support for his position.  She told
him his position was wrong and that the EEI board members wanted to work on
the strawman first and to have something to look at in June on that - not
the retail quadrant - although the two efforts could proceed at the same
time.  Owens and I agreed to talk on Monday following the NERC meeting to
set up an EEI/GISB board level meeting ASAP.  Mike will not be a part of
that effort; Dave Owens will. -- Bill"

Thanks, Rae

Rick Causey came to see me asking us to firm up our Q2 numbers.  Can we let 
Rick know that your Q2 numbers are likely to be up?  If so by how much?

-Presentation to potential buyer went well. Questions mostly around power
supply trading, and risk/reward formula with customers and shareholders, that
is in agreement with OPUC.
-California's rolling black-outs have pushed up prices in the West, allowing
opportunities for PGE to continue to sell into the market.
-All IOUs, State Agencies (OR,ID,WA), Power Councils, BPA, and security
coordinator met to address emergency preparedness. There is beginning to be
heightened concern about Fall and Winter supply.
-Union negotiations continued, and progress was made understanding needs and
issues. Next meeting scheduled for May 21. Union seems to be in no hurry, and
needs for time to get interests aligned.
-De-reg Bill continues to be uncertain. It has become a political football,
where legislatures are convinced, who ever carries or doesn't carry forward,
depending on future power situation, will determine which party ends up in
majority, and as governor in the state. Politics....ugh
-Final contracts should be received tomorrow. Will work to turn them around as
quickly as possible, but I know people will need a few days with them, and a
few more issues may need to be addressed. There are some employment
agreements, and other contracts that were put in place by others, that have
created some benefits, that people feel they are giving up with new
agreements. Some is perception, some is real, some is lack of trust for
Enron's  intent, when things are not written precisely.

This is to confirm a meeting tomorrow, May 15, from 2:00 to 3:00PM in Stan 
Horton's office, EB5020, to go over the Clean Fuels numbers.

Thanks, John, I will add Sarita to my "cc" list.    And, yes, we'll get both 
you and Phil on Stan's calendar to go over the "Operations Alliances" 
topic...I will await their call to schedule.

Cindy,
Will you please add my new Administrative Assistant to your future "cc" 
lists?  She is Sarita Garza.  Thanks so much.  John

P.S.  I have asked Sarita and Amelia to get with you and see when a favorable 
date would be that Phil Lowry and I could have about 30 minutes with Stan to 
go over the "Operations Alliances" with him (since his half day staff meeting 
was cancelled for May 16).  Anyway, this is just a heads-up that they will be 
in touch to get a date confirmed.  Thank you.  JHS

The Madera project in California should not be going forward.  We had a 
meeting whereby we all agreed to cancel this project.  Please get with John 
to see what is up.

Stan, 
Today is Diane Bazelides' last day of work at Azurix. Over the last month, 
Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations 
function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know, 
Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public 
relations challenges. 
Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These 
employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR 
function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of 
the PR employees.
To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and 
John provided me and Shelley: 
? Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates 
spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations. 
As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media 
will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario. 
? The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in 
California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface. 
? Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is 
where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know 
more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires. 
? As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with 
the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is 
involved in Azurix. 
I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center 
in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope 
we don't have to use.
Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function 
further.

I just went through a restructuring of my portfolio with Morgan Stanley.  I 
think I am fine for now.  Thank you.

Mr. Horton,

We appreciate your time a few weeks ago and sincerely hope we were able to
clearly convey our disciplined investment approach to you during our
meeting.    We also hope we were able to help you to re-define the term
"risk".   Using our disciplined approach, we have been able to provide our
clients with consistent returns
and avoid negative returns over the course of the past 10 years.  We credit
the success to developing and implementing a very focused and structured
investment plan.

At this point, we would like to have your permission to put together a
proposal for a portfolio which would be constructed upon the same philosophy
and guidelines utilized by Yale University's multi-billion dollar endowment
fund.    The purpose of the proposal would be to show you how we build our
client portfolios
in an attempt to minimize ( if not eliminate ) negative annual returns while
providing above market returns.

We know you would find the proposal interesting and would give you better
insight into how
high net worth individuals, endowments and wealthy family groups construct
their investment
portfolios.

We look forward to hearing back from you.  Have a great day.

Sincerely,

Congratulations on getting the ROW extension with the Navajo Nation

Thank you!

Stan

Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou 
would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus 
should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all 
of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.

I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.

With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention 
bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave 
before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place 
that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should 
we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently 
offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA 
assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those 
positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual 
agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced 
severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford 
and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for 
him.

I will talk with you when you return.

Thanks.

We received the two deposits you expected this week. The amount of the

I would be happy to meet with you.  Just call Cindy to set up a time.

Stan. I am a glutton for punishment with now pursuing my MBA. But it is 
energizing (pardon, the pun) and very enjoyable. In light of this, I am to 
interview a leader about certain aspects of leadership, i.e. does leadership 
develop with experience, have there been one or two instrumental experiences 
that were signficant in developing your own leadeship style?

As my leader, would you have about 30 minutes or so, sometime this week, to 
discuss your ideas about leadership with me? To maximize your time, I would 
be glad to provide all questions in advance so I don't waste any time.

Please let me know and I hope you can visit with me.

This is more information than I think we need to supply.  Can we meet to 
discuss?

Attached is a draft of Steve's presentation for Thursday's technical 
conference.  Please reply with any comments or call me at 713/853-6007.

Thanks,
Lindy

I will make the tee times and let you know.  Steve, I will include you and 
your wife for Sunday but please confirm if you can make it or not.  

Stan,
I will be unable to play Thursday; Tom is aware of this.
As to Sunday, count on me. Just let me know the tee time.

Hello, Shelley!     I just want to confirm that this speech is just a talking

Attached is a draft presentation for Stan to use during his 15 minute 
pipeline safety update at the Natural Gas Council meeting in Houston on 
November 29.  Please view the attached file in notes format to see the 
talking points.  Stan plans to handout copies of the slides.

Dave/Phil/John -- please check the slides for accuracy.

The current draft does not make mention of a possible voluntary program or 
request and particular support from the Natural Gas Council.  We may want to 
add these points.  Also, the attached draft does not reflect any points from 
the NTSB hearings being held this week.  

I cannot play on Thursday but thanks for letting me know.  Could you check 
with Steve and his wife for their availability on Sunday.  I emailed him but 
wanted to make sure he got it.  Thanks.

I have no such studies.

I am preparing the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing for Enron Corp. in connection 
with the sale of the MTBE/Isomerization facility to EOTT Energy Partners, 
L.P.  I believe that the filing should be made by this Friday, May 25 in 
order to be sure that the 30 day waiting period will expire before the 
anticipated closing date of June 29.  Please read the attached memo which 
requests that each of you look through your files to determine whether or not 
you possess the types of documents described in the memo.  I would be happy 
to discuss any questions that you may have regarding whether or not 
particular documents in your files would be responsive to this request.  
Since Enron needs to make this filing by Friday, it is important that you 
respond to the memo by Thursday, May 24.

Hello, Suzanne!   Stan Horton will attend in person.

After negotiations with my better half,  I will be ready to play Sunday.
My wife Julie is also willing to play on Sunday and we are trying to arrange
for a baby sitter.  Either way,  I will be there.  Please let me know the
time when it comes available.  Thank you.

Best regards.
Steve Westlund

Hello, Steve!   Thanks for the alert!    I did just call the Pro Shop one 
more time and spoke with a young lady by the name of Ashley, and she confirms 
that you guys are slated to tee off on Sunday at 8:15AM on the Old Course off 
#1.

Hit  'em straight!

Cindy

Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank
you again.  Please meeting you via e-mail.

I just wanted to make sure you guys know everything I do.  Actually this is 
somewhat bullish considering past legislative attempts.
Jeffrey Keeler

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Cindy double checked.  We are ok for 8:15 on Sunday

Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position 
Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via 
telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is 
being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early 
next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.

Peggy:

Considering where we are in the divestiture process, I don't think it is the 
right time to have PGE contract for and administer the Health and Welfare 
Benefits noted in your memo dated 04/20/01.  In addition, it is likely that a 
potential buyer would want PGE to come under its own Health and Welfare 
Benefits.  Switching now could entail having PGE employees being under three 
Plans in a relatively short period of time.

Shelly, we can do that but check with Cindy when she returns next week.

Thank you.

I am very happy for you.  It sounds as if everything in your life is going in 
the right direction.  I think you will enjoy working in the DC ofice and for 
Joe.  I am sure you will learn alt.  Also, thank you for remembering Jason 
and Jessica's 1 year birthday.  The designer T-shirts were great and they 
look really cute in them.  That was very thoughful of you to remember.  Good 
luck!

Stan,

As you probably know, I have accepted a position as Regulatory Analyst 
reporting to Joe Hartsoe.  My last day in Houston is June 29 and I will start 
my new responsibilities on July 16.

By means of this message I want to thank you for making this possible.  This 
is a big challenge for me and opens a new spectrum of possibilities in a 
completely different arena.

I am looking forward to being a part of the ETS team.

Thanks again,

Karina

Stan has decided to cancel our December Half Day Staff Meeting, which was 
scheduled for December 14, 2000.

Thanks,
Cindy

Sounds good.  
give me a call when you return.  Happy Thanksgiving to all.

Unfortunately I cannot play on Sunday.  We will try the following weekend.  
Thanks

Take it easy.  I tried to play last week at a company outing and can barely 
walk now.  It is hell getting old!!  Happy Thanksgiving.

I will attend in person.  Thanks

Lunch sounds great.  The question is when would be a good time.  Cindy is out 
this week but I will have her figure out a date.  

My knee is killing me.  I am going to sue Dr. Frost!!  I just decided to go 
pretty easy on it for the next couple of weeks and see if it gets any 
better.  Talk with you tonight.  Bye the way Jessica is not doing well. DK is 
taking her to the doctor today.  I will let you know how she is tonight.

Dad

Shelley, we need to make sure Mike knows of all the ramifications of this 
entire deal.  I have no problem with them pursuing a regulatory approach to 
the quality issue but a commercial decision would be better for all parties.

Looks ok to me.

I am glad things are working out for you.

Six lousy weeks away from me and you go do something like this.  Now it will 
no more golf because you will have too many "honey do's" to do.

Just kidding.  That is great news.  Congratulations.  I can't wait to meet 
her.  When is the wedding date?

Apology accepted.  My feelings were hurt considering laning you the BMW, 
paying for dinner and washing and filling your car with gas!!

Love,  Dad

I do not think I will be able to do the conference call tomorrow.  Could you 
call me on Monday with further information on our panel?

Good morning.  I am at EOTT today and then I will go into to town for a 
little while.  Jessica is no9t doing very well and neither I am I.  Fell like 
I am coming down with something.  Talk with you later tonight.  Sorry I 
didn,t get to talk with you last night.  Both babies were real fussy and we 
had to work hard to get them down.  I did a pretty good job with Jason!

I look forward to you getting home for Turkey Day!

Dad

I recieved the same document.  If you would distribute it to the committee 
that would be appreciated.  I would think we might want to discuss it at the 
Board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with EEI.  What do you 
think?  I can see pros and cons of meeting with EEI prior to the next Board 
meeting.

Depending on the strawman I feel we are beginning to lose key support from 
the Board to work this matter.  Bill we need to get the Board to continue to 
follow him if we are to make progress.

Good morning.  Thanks for the yahoo greeting.  It made my day.  Have a great 
day.  Remember that Cathy and Carol's birthday is Nov. 30th.  I sent them a 
card and a $100 check to go out to dinner on us.  I signed it from all of 
us.  Hope you don't mind.  

They would enjoy an email from you.

Love' Dad

Thanks for the strawman.  I would like to discuss it at our GISB Board 
meeting on December 7th.  Any problems with doing that?  We have distributed 
to the Board Committee only.  My initial reaction is there is alot we agree 
on but there is much we do not agree on.  Let me know about the Board meeting.

Also, this Board meeting will be my last as Chairman.  I do not know what 
role, if any, Bill Boswell  (the incoming Chairman) would like me to play in 
the future in this effort.

It is my understanding that we must get approval from the Office of the 
Chairman to utilize the company aircraft for personal use.

My family is holding a Holiday Reunion in Atlanta December 18-23.  Debbie and 
I would like to fly to Atlanta and back on Friday, December 22, with our 
children.  The twins, Jason and Jessica, are a little bit too young yet to 
try the commercial airlines, which is why I am requesting to use a company 
aircraft.

Of course, we would only secure a plane if it is NOT needed for business 
purposes that particular day and would be subject to company policy on all 
charges.

No problem if this doesn't work!

Stan

Stan would like to offer out the following Rockets' tickets (4 tickets per

Agree.  Please handle at the Audit Committee meeting.

It should be the Chairman's choice but I would favor a Houston location.  
Also, please strongly consider having the Board meeting on Tuesday afternoon 
in lieu of the golf outing.  You might just get some Board members to attend 
at least one day of the annual meeting.

Stan

Hello, Dana!   The 1/24 tickets have already been spoken for, but you may 
certainly have the 12/21 tickets.   I'll mail them out to you soon.

Cindy

If available - I would like either the 12/21 tickets or the 1/24 tickets 

thanks

I am the systems security administrator. I am in the process of cleaning up
the systems user lists. Your name is on the user list but it does not seem
to be on the employee/ETS  lists that I have. Please let me know if you are
an employee so I do not delete your access in the clean up.

Thanks for remembering their birthdays.  Drive carefully!!  See you sometime

Based upon your representations I see no conflict and wish you well in your 
new job.

Please see attached.   Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or 
concerns.

Hello, Rosie!   Stan has this on his calendar and will attend.

Have a great weekend,

Ken and Jeff have decided that the Enron Executive Committee Retreat will 
include only the Corporate Policy Committee this year.  (See list of members 
below.)  You may be holding the timeframe of January 16-18, 2001 on your 
calendar, which you can now free up if you are not on the committee.

The location of the retreat is under consideration.  When a decision is made, 
we will get the information to the members of the Corporate Policy 
Committee.  Departure for the retreat will be early afternoon on Tuesday, 
January 16 with return to Houston late afternoon on Thursday, January 18.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions at 713-853-6088.

It was the right answer for everybody.  Good luck and let me know if my group 
can be of any help!

Stan

Thank you for a very successful holiday party.  Debbie and I thoroughly 
enjoyed the evening.  Your hard work definitely paid-off for our entire 
organization.

I would like to host a lunch for the committee, after the holidays, as a way 
of thanking you.   I will have Cindy coordinate your schedules.

Thanks again,
Stan

My condolences on the loss of your grandfather.  Please let us know if there 
is anything we can do.

Stan

You are beginning to realize that time goes by awfully fast and we had better 
enjoy what we are doing while we are doing it.  You never get another chance 
at today!!  End of my phiposophical analysis of life for tday!

You are welcome to the car.  I will try to bring it tonight or better still 
can your Mom bring you over to get it tomorrow.  Either way is ok.

Daddy

Steve indicated to me that Koch has a 50% interest in the company.

Thanks.  Seems like everyone had a good time.  Happy Holidays!!

A's always please me.  You seem to have applied yourself this semester and I 
am pleased.  Congratulations.

Thanks for the note.  My policy is that I do not interfere in the hiring 
practices of my direct reports other to ensure that ETS is complying with all 
Enron policies and procedures.  I suggest that you contact Jerry Martin, Phil 
Lowry and Gary Smith.

Good luck on your search!

Stan

Will do.  Thanks!

FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit 
Committee.

SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald 
Smith wanted someone with an operations background.

Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of 
Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.

Stan

I have asked Wilson Barbee t9o see if he can provide any assistance to you.  
I do hope you find something that meets your qualifications.

Thanks for keeping me updated.

Stan

I am at EOTT this morning.  Glad we early voted.  I think Bush has it and I 
don't think it will be that close.  Watch how Florida and Pennslylvania go.  
If they go Bush; its over.  If Gore wins these two states he has a chance if 
he takes Michigan.  Key states are Florida, Pennslylvania,and Michigan.

I am still hoping for a last minute Nader rally.  

Sorry you don't feel well especially since this your your long day.  Good 
luck on your test.  I will be at the Rockets game tonight with tthe guys.

Email later this afternoon.

Love, Dad

Carol:

Thank you for the prompt.   

The only times Stan has available for this conference call would be at 8:00AM 
tomorrow morning or 8:00AM Friday morning (central time).

Let us know what works.

Skip would like to set up a conference call for some time this week.  The
subject is immediate market conditions.  Please let me know your
availability for a call (approx 30 mins) for Thursday or Friday of this
week.
Thank-you.

I can play on Sunday morning this week.  My eldest daughter has a Horse Show 
that I need to be at on Saturday.  Next week I could play either Saturday or 
Sunday.  Please let me know.

Looks ok

looks good

This looks ok to me.

I agree with Jim; it doesn't cost anything to listen.

I agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give 
originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal 
flow improves dramatically.

For EOTT, we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period..  We do not 
need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business.  In fact a portfolio of 
assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices.  
Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices.  
Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit.  That would 
include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well 
as fee based processing.  Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok 
as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE..electric generation).  
Terminals are also an excellent acquistion for MLP,s.

Does this get to your issues?

Thanks

Who is playing on Sunday besides me!

A report would be fine.  You two are the experts.

I will see you at 9 am on Sunday.  I am looking forward to playing again and 
to seeing you after almost a month.

I am sorry that you don't feel well.  Sounds like you have a cold or flu 
bug.  Please go to the Health Center and get some antibiotics.  If you feel 
bad later in the week, make reservations to fly home this weekend and put the 
bill on the credit card.  I will check with your mom tonight to see how you 
are.  

Love,  Your Daddy

Thank you for sending these reports to me.  They are informative and timely.  
By the way, did you get Randy Horton's power of attorney form?  She has asked 
me to invest some of her excess cash and I executed the form and thought she 
had mailed it in.  Please let me know.

Thanks to you and David for the outstanding service.

Stan

Good luck to you.  Hopefully I can get out there this afternnon and see you 
ride.  I love you.

Daddy

This looks good!  Thank you.

I heard you are scheduled for another interview.  Good luck.

Just a note to say Good Morning.  See you this afternoon at EOTT.
Stan

The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of 
Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested 
groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.

Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences 
between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of 
similarities."   GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by 
the end of January.  
GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two 
proposals which have been advanced thus far.

Thanks

Please just call Cindy Stark to get on my calendar.  I would warn you that I 
cannot see expending money for such a book since I do not see any value that 
would be added.  It would be nice to have but I was turning down painting 
projects on our pipeline that were in the $10k range during oour budget cycle!

Stan

Glad you finally made it!  Good luck on your Legal exam today.  Get some rest 
and start studying for Wednesday and Thursday exams.  The finish is close at 
hand.

Enjoyed taking you last night.  I like the time alone with you.  Saturday, I 
have a haircut at 2:30 so we can start shopping at 3 or go early and be done 
by noon.  Let me know and send me your Mother's list!

Dad

NADER!  NADER!  NADER!

Thank you!

There is sure alot of scheduled activity where there is no revised completion 
date or a note that it is completed.  Can we get an update?

This is to advise you that we will NOT have ETS Monday morning staff meetings 
on December 18 or December 25.    

Please make note that the next ETS Staff Meeting will be held on Tuesday, 
January 2, 2001 at 9:30AM in 49C2.   And then on January 8, we'll resume our 
regular schedule of having our staff meetings on Monday mornings at 9:15AM.

Well, folks, one should never use the word 'final' around here!    Friday's 
PRC meeting room location at the Hotel Sofitel has been changed to the Opera

By the way I have the sweater you wore last Sunday that you left on the golf

The press release looks fine

I have contacted the relevant people of your interest in the job.

Danny_Jones%ENRON@eott.com on 04/30/2001 01:39:56 PM
Dear Mr. Horton,  I have recently been made aware of a help desk analyst
job#0000108806 that has become available in your department. I am currently
employed with the aviation department (hangar attendant) of enron and would
like to use my past knowledge and experience to persue my goals in the
technology feild. I am asking respectfully if you could give me a
recommendation or referral to ETS technology department. Anything you could
do to help further my goals would be appreciated.

          Respectfully,

I agree the timing is awful.  By this memo I am asking Gary Smith to see if this can be expedited in any way.

Stan,
 
We need to get access to our Employee Savings / ESOP plans ASAP. They are currently tied up  while the Savings Plan moves to a new administrator. I cannot believe the timing of this move. It couldn't have come at a worse time.
 
Thanks,
Loren R. Charbonneau

Please call Cindy and set up a time for us to chat.  If it would be helpful I would gladly to a phone meeting with your Direct reports.  

Stan,

We are all shocked to read the news although I guess given the way the press
and the markets have acted recently not surprised.

For the employees here we are delivering a very clear business as usual
message.  Press enquiries we are routing to Enron.  The UK press is full of
speculation that Wessex Water is to be sold.

When the dust settles it will be useful to discuss what happens now.  In
particular we need to decide how we deal with AEL refinancing etc.

There is no rush but when you have a minute I would welcome a word.

Good job.

I gave it a try and it looks great!  I look forward to Mikie's memo today.  ENE employees will be pleased to have access again.  Thanks for the response and my compliments to the benefits team on getting the job completed ahead of schedule.

Already done.  Last week, we worked with Hewitt and the Admin Committee to agree to do everything possible to speedup the transition period.  Mikie set up a Web and phone line for updates for all participants so that they would know immediately if we were successful in getting it completed early.  To notify folks, a postcard was sent to each participants home last week.  We did a quick check at the Admin Committee meeting yesterday and confirmed that each of the members and all others present for the meeting with the exception of one received their postcards on Friday/Saturday of last week.  One of the agenda items for the committee was to let them know that the transition was completed yesterday.  In fact the update was posted on the web-site on Monday night.  Mikie is preparing an e-mail to all employees that will go out today to let them know.    Give it try by accessing benefits.enron.com.
 
Thanks

See notes below.  Any chance of opening before November 20?

Thanks Ken.  The Dynegy folks took me to New York for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about Enron's pipelines and about me coming over.  The only problem is they never asked me if I was planning on going over.  I know their CEO and COO very well so I will probably have a choice.  I would like to see this thing through.  I committed in my current contract to stay until 3/1/05 so I would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless.  I do feel an obligation to help right the ship.  My businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now.  Employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical.  Either way I will be fine.  Thanks for your concern.  It means alot.

Stan

I hope everything is going to work out ok for you. I just read about Lay
turning down his 60,000,000.00, when are they going to decide who stays and
goes?? I hope you have a buyout clause in your contract!!!!!!!!write when you
have a chance,just wanted you to know I was thinking of you.  Ken

I trust everything is going well.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.  At the next Board meeting I am sheduled to provide the Board with an update of Enron Global Services.  Could you have someone prepare a couple of slides on Portland.  One should deal with the major accomplishements of your group in 2001 (ie rate case etc) in bullet form.  The second should be an update of the deal with NNG.  Perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events.  Call if you have questions.  Thanks.  The Board meeting is scheduled for December 6th.

Thanks Mike.  Much appreciated.

Stan

I imagine you often get notes of appreciation, but I wanted to add my note of thanks for taking the time to speak to ETS in 3AC this afternoon. 

You came across as a Leader that demonstrated compassion, honesty, sincerity, credibility, and understanding. You told people their opinions were important, and that you understood how they felt. You clearly stated that what happened should not have happened. Despite the fact that you were not part of the collapse, you apologized as part of the management team.

You spoke positively of the future, of the new company, and of the people that would be at the helm in the new company. 

In todays environment, Leaders need to be seen and heard. I sincerely believe employees want to regain a level of trust in the company and leaders they thought they knew. 

I believe you made a positive step in making that happen with your comments today. 

Again, thanks. I do hope you plan to provide the future leadership for 'Dynegy T&D' assets.

Thank you Rick.  Those were very kind words.  Everything will turn out ok. =
 I believe that.

Stan, I know you have a lot going on right now and probably don't need more=
 emails that seem to be coming from off the wall but I felt the need to exp=
ress some of my thoughts about what's going on right now and I hope you wil=
l take just a minute to listen.  As you get older, you seem to reflect more=
 on things that are happening around you and how it affects you and those a=
round you.  Some might perceive this message as "sucking up" or "jockeying =
for position" but nothing could be farther from the truth.  This one is fro=
m the heart. =20

First, I want to say that I believe that many of us in the pipelines have t=
aken for granted over the years the kind and quality of leadership that we =
have had.  I want to thank you for being the kind of leader that you have b=
een, one that's honest, straight forward, tells it like it is and yet will =
make the tough calls when they need to be made, but always in the interest =
of the company, the employees and its shareholders.  I've been fortunate to=
 be able to work with you over the last ten or so years and know that you h=
ave lived the Enron values.  Had others run their business units the way yo=
u have run the pipes, I truly belive that we would not be where we are at t=
oday. Thank you for being the kind of leader you are.  I for one appreciate=
 it.  =20

For those of us that have poured our hearts and souls into this company for=
 most of our life, these are tough times and I know that you can certainly =
relate to that.  And while my financial well being and security has certain=
ly been impacted, there are others out there far worse off than me and I ac=
tually feel like I am truly blessed.  Blessed to have been a part of such a=
 great company, blessed to work with the kind of people that have made this=
 company what it is and blessed to have the opportunity to rebuild a new an=
d even better company.  There are things in life much more important than m=
oney, family (grandsons), life, challenges in your work, health and happine=
ss.  I don't know what the future holds for me or the company, I just know =
it's part of a much bigger plan that I can't control.  I also know that we =
can't look back.  What's done is done and it happend for a reason.  What we=
 have to do is move on.  If there's a meaningful  role for me as we go forw=
ard, I will approach it with the same commitment, dedication and enthusiasm=
 that I have any job I have had.  If there's not, I'm at peace with that to=
o.  The success of this company, past, present and future will always be in=
 our people.  Thanks for the time and thanks for the leadership you have pr=
ovided ETS all these years. =20

WOW, does this sound depressing or what?  It's really not meant to be.  I h=
ave a great attititude about what the future holds. Have a great day.   

Thank you for your kind words.  We will get through this and we all will be better for it.  Lessons are sometimes learned the hard way.

Stan, I wanted to thank you again for the time you took from your busy day to visit with us concerning the future of our company.  I as well as many of the employees in Enron took some risks with our stock and 401K and lost almost everything we have worked 28+ years, based on what Mr. Skilling advised.  You were right that we suffered a severe blow to both our company image as well as our future personal plans.  

I also realize you did not promise us anything and know that you cannot, but it really felt great to hear your encouraging words.  Yes we have had a great loss, but with time (and a job with our new company) can replace some of the loss.  It takes time to heal from these financial wounds, but if we continue to communicate with management and between employees, we can again be proud of what we have worked so many years to build.  It has really been great to work with you through these past few years and look to you to lead us into our new world.

Thanks for the report.  Just what I needed.

For Portland General Electric, week of April 23, 2001
1)Announcement of termination of Enron and Sierra Pacific deal was uneventful,
and not surprising to employees and Portland Community.
2)Time was spent in addressing questions from data room in San Francisco.
3)FERC ordered the Cal ISO to file by 6/1/01, a RTO proposal with FERC. At the
same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA)
to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that
addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for
creating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help prevent
California's efforts to balkanize their power system.
4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the
independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of
the 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect's
independence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file for
innovative and incentive rates.
5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market.
6)Thermal plants are in sequential annual  maintenance outages.
7)Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW.
8)Contract negotiations continue with IBEW Local 125. Next meeting is
scheduled for May 7.
9)Customer Information System installation is approaching 75% completion,
being on schedule, and under budget.
10)Joint Meter Reading project is on target with 850,000 routes now merged
with NW Natural Gas.
11)SB 1149, Oregon's version of deregulation, is still uncertain in the
legislature. We are ready to implement on whatever timeframe is decided.
12)We plan to submit another fast track small microturbine generating plant
for RAROC next week.
13)Senator Gordon Smith reception held to keep contact on issues around price
caps, and there determental effect on energy markets and new generation.

I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less)
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday. 
You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

I can't begin to tell you what my days  are like now.  Unbelievable is the =

Howdy Daddy!!!!  Wassup!?!?!?!  Not much  here.  I just got out of my b.law=

Hi Stan,

I am sorry this took so long to reply to but I was out of the office yester=
day with my little one on a field trip. =20

Here is the feedback (combined with my own appreciation of how people feel)=
 and some very humble suggestions that I hope will help.

During the EGAS session, people felt very good about being able to air out =
their concerns and about getting "official information" as to the proposed =
merger and implications on the company.  Some times, even if no new informa=
tion is provided, people simply feel better because an effort is made to co=
mmunicate with them.  People appreciated your open-ness and the frank-ness =
with which you addressed some of the tougher questions regarding long term =
employment viability or security.  On the other hand, people read a message=
 into the statements regarding the fact that retention packages will be dev=
eloped for key individuals.  They read that if they didn't get a retention =
package they should be looking for a job because they are not key.  Perhaps=
, bluntly, that is exactly what the message is but now you have many people=
 spending their time trying to figure out the "definition of key individual=
."  People like to feel important (non-core is, for them, non-important) an=
d absent that they worry about every little thing - many of these no one ca=
n help or mitigate.  Finally, people took comfort in the comment regarding =
how long it might take for all to be sold (i.e,. approx. 3 years) and under=
stood and felt better that no fire sale will take place.   =20

My biggest recommendations are:
-=09We need to keep up our communication efforts; people feel important and=
 feel better if folks make an effort to communicate;  Pete and I (and other=
s) need to work on =09communicating further with each of our teams and on m=
otivating them to support the company during these tough times but both you=
 and Jim should continue to =09update people as often as possible.
-=09We need to move quickly to identify our key people so that we can be ef=
fective about retention efforts;  my own view is that you start with the fi=
eld; those are your =09most critical individuals because they are running t=
he asset. =20
-=09We need to continue to deliver the message that the merger is a good th=
ing and that it is not simply another "life" bought out by Enron (i.e., man=
y people felt and still =09feel that there is still a chance Enron might ma=
ke on its own and would pay the breakage fee to get out of the Dynegy deal =
- this may be more hope than belief but =09that is the case).

A key distinction that I noted in the meeting today was that it sounds as t=
hough we will move forward very aggressively to sell all of the EGAS assets=
.  There is no longer the attitude or position that: if the asset has good =
earnings and good cashflow, then what's the hurry.  The message today (and =
forgive me if I mis-read it) was: we will put together a corp. development =
group that will be focused on selling EGAS assets even if they are performi=
ng assets - cash is still king and will continue to be until the merger.

Hope this helps and THANK YOU very much for taking the time to talk to us.

Mariella=20
We will discuss at the next Staff meeting.  Thanks for bringing it up.  Any=
 feedback from the floor meeting yesterday would be appreciated.

Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus=
 difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaz=
a.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the pos=
ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa=
red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has be=
en the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floati=
ng of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cas=
h crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully gu=
aranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, B=
LM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would c=
ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th=
e GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from acti=
ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with pri=
vate parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which=
 although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a "mark" on th=
e company's liquidity position. =20

Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panam=
a or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made=
) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro=
n to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The sa=
me could go for SECLP and Gaza.

This is simply an overall "guidance" question.  Let's take it up during our=
 staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Many thanks, Mariella

I am sorry I did not get to you first and let you know.  My apologies.  I really appreciated your interest in the position and your commitment to ETS.  You are a quality individual and I respect you for that.  Thanks.

Stan:  

Shelley informed me this morning that it has been decided that Steve Hotte will remain at EGS as the CIO.  I wanted you to know that I believe this decision is the best outcome for your organization at this time.  

In addition, I wanted to express my appreciation for considering me for the CIO position.  Although I have been at Enron a short time, I am pleased that I have the support of your management team and have exhibited to them that I have the capabilities of operating at the officer level.  

As we go through the inevitable changes that will occur through the merger, you have my commitment that I will focus my team on their ETS projects.  I truly believe we can impress Dynegy with our outstanding pipeline operations and our strategic initiatives.  

Thank you,

Brad Holmes     

My apology for missing the Dynegy Board meeting that Ken told me today at !:00pm that you wanted me to attend.  I had my international team in for business and budget reviews and to discuss what "non-core" means since both Dynegy and Enron have labeled them as such.  We need to keep these folks motivated to get us through the sale process.  I couldn't reschedule them since they were heading home tonight.  They are fine and willing to see this through.  Please let Chuck know that I just had a conflict.

Congratulations on a very successful rollout with the Analysts on Monday.  Sorry I couldn't go to Chicago with Chuck but it appeared I would have been a detraction.  I would like to sit down over luch with you when you have the time to see what your plans are.  In the meantime call if I can be of any help.

Stan

The total bonus pool needed for EGS is $54,800,000.  The amount charged and paid by joint ventures is $5,091062.  The Enron portion would thus be $49,708,938.  This is a reduction of  $14,846,779 for 2001 bonuses charged to Enron.

I know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on.  I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  I can tell you that Jeff McMahon did receive the offer from the Royal Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.  I have supplied him the potential financial impact of Enron accepting that offer.  As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.

Ken Lay and Dynegy have both characterised Enron's investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  We all recommended that if Enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.  That is where we are right now.  Again, please send me your comments.  I would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.  I am sorry if I have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.  Things are quite hectic as you can imagine.

Stan,

1.	There is still considerable speculation that Wessex is to be sold by
Enron.  Bill Alexander, CEO of Thames Water is quoted as saying "We cannot
offer as much as Enron paid but we can make Enron a better company".  Since
Thames is well behind Wessex in all the efficiency and service comparators,
it is difficult to see quite how he intends to improve Wessex!  Any proposal
by another UK water and wastewater company to buy Wessex would trigger an
automatic Competition Commission reference.  Previous references to the
Competition Commission have resulted in such combinations not being allowed.
The Director General of Water Services has said publicly that he would
oppose such combinations.

2.	The Royal Bank of Scotland have called to tell us "as a matter of
courtesy", that they will be submitting an offer for Wessex.  I believe it
will be "at or around" the RAB value and will be sent to Geoff MacMahon.
Our response to RBS and to others who have called has been that our
understanding is that Enron are not seeking to sell Wessex at this time and
to refer them to Houston.

3.	We remain on course to meet the full year earnings target.  This is
despite having to make greater provisions than we expected to restructure
Swiss Combi Technology following the decision of Andritz to terminate
discussions to buy the company.

4.	The ?50m index linked private placement is currently with the
lawyers.  We are on track to close the transaction two weeks today.

5	We will need to begin the process of renegotiating our committed
bank facilities soon.  We are proceeding as previously agreed with Ben
Glisan.

6.	 We have been contacted privately by S&P who have told us that they
are likely to put Wessex and AEL on credit watch (developing) to reflect the
financial uncertainties around Enron and the future ownership of Wessex.

I met with El Paso yesterday.  They seem very interested.

Thanks

I will call him again on Monday.  Do I get a commission.  Just kidding.

Stan

I haven't heard from the fellow from El Paso

Do we have to pay them!

        Not much this week.

Stan,

Rory Cullinan of the Royal Bank of Scotland called this morning to say that
he had received positive messages in response to his offer.  He is flying to
Houston probably tomorrow (Tuesday) to try to meet with Jeff McMahon.

Adam_Umanoff%ENRON@eott.com on 04/29/2001 12:23:55 PM
1.  Aura.
     -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as "real."  UBS
will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's
expense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains
mixed.
     -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process
can be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists
seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.
     -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial
projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02
EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of
$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,
showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.

2.  M&A Activity.
     -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,
continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in
May.
     -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but
execution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greek
development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.

3.  2001 Commercial Activity.
     -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed our
projected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation of
suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US
wind regimes.
     -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the
two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);
indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty
of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with
EWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,
we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt
financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in
June.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt
closing.
     -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw
turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the
largest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very well
received.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss
IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent
infringement grounds).

4.  HR Issues.
     -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have
expressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss
with Horton early in week).
     -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global
procurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visit
hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed
oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit
for this position in the midst of Aura.

Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level
of focus.  Talk with you soon. Adam

I will await Jeff's call.  Can you fill me in on what is happening with Wessex.  Colin Skellet has been notified that the potential buyer is coming here to have discussions with McMahon.  I need to get in the information loop if at all possible. Thanks

I've asked jeff golden to get with you regarding the meeting we've discussed having with Bill Wise and or Ralph Eads of El Paso to go over list of opportunities we are talking to various epg business units about. If this meeting is next week I recommend you,mcconnel and either mitch taylor or jeff golden attend. Purpose is to give them an overall pespective of what we are trying to accomplish and to avoid the fire sale appearance. 

Quite frankly I am getting tired of memos like this!  There has not been a =
decision not to provide short-term liquidity for Enron Wind.  If there was =
I would have called.  Enron is in the midst of a liquidity crisis.  I need =
the support of the entire team as does Enron to help us get through this.  =
I need you to see the bigger picture and to think of ways that Wind can hel=

Thank you!

While I understand that the Wind Co is clearly a "non-core" asset for Enron=
,  I am very concerned about the apparent decision in Houston not to provid=

 on its own for cash  going forward). While I am probably more eager than a=
nyone to have the Wind Co regain its financial independence, I can not do i=
t overnight and am worried about the potentially devasting impact which a l=

e value of this asset to Enron.

 As you know, our lenders on IMI/Clear Sky have refused to fund a construct=

 FPL and AEP have in essence put on hold their deals with Enron Wind pendin=
g some clarity on how Enron's liquidity difficulties may affect Enron Wind.=
  AEP has gone as far as saying the Enron Wind is probably BK without worki=
ng capital support from Enron, and are understandably asking why should the=
y be comfortable with our performance risk?  Our European vendors, still mi=
ndful of Tacke's bankruptcy in 1997, are extremely concerned about our fina=
ncial condition.  And a number of our counterparties who owe us money but a=
re also owed money by Enron affiliates are seeking to set-off those obligat=
ions.  While I will have better numbers over this weekend, without the IMI/=
Clear Sky construction loan, I will need between $30-35mm through the end o=
f the year (until the AEP sale closes) in order to meet our working capital=
 needs.  Without that support, I can almost guaranty you I will not be able=
 to sell IMI/Clear Sky to AEP and am worried about our short-term financial=
 survival. =20

Stan - this clearly has serious implications for the value of Enron Wind an=

) over the weekend and on Monday morning.  I will set up some time with you=
 on Monday or Tuesday to discuss.  I know there is no desire to support the=

Adam

What meeting on Tuesday?  No one has informed me of a Tuesday meeting.

The company has retained J.C. Nickens of the firm of Clements, O'Neill, Pierce & Nickens to represent you.  J.C. will introduce himself  to you at our meeting on Tuesday.  He is an excellent lawyer who will do a great job.

As you may have become aware, the company received notice yesterday that you have been named as defendants (along with Enron Corp., Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow, and Arthur Andersen) in one of the federal securities class actions.  I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint.  We are in the process of determining who would be the most effective counsel for you.  If you wish to have separate representation, please let me know.  I cannot guarantee that the D&O carrier will reimburse you for the cost of separate counsel.  

I am setting up a meeting with counsel for Enron Corp., Susman & Godfrey, to discuss this litigation with you as soon as possible.  Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions.

Thank you.      

I like it.  Thanks.

Stan,

Below is a Thanksgiving note from you to all EGS US employees.  Please let me know what feedback you have.  John Ambler reviewed and approved this message.  I'd like to get this out to employees on Tuesday, Nov. 20.

Also, I'm on tap with Lou to get an ETS Salutes memo out early next week acknowledging the employees/departments who worked this week on the financing.

Look forward to hearing from you....Gina

With the Thanksgiving Holiday upon us, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives and who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I know here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and everyone in the organization is working hard.  Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan 

From a valuation standpoint I assume Case 1 would give us the highest multiple.  The issue is is it doable?  We have achieved $600 million last year.  Also, before we go further with Project Armstrong I would like to get Whalley and Dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal.  Let's suspend these discussions for the time being.

Stan

What is your choice?
Rod,
Attached are three cases for Project Armstrong.  I know you're out of the office until Wednesday but I thought if you could respond by Blackberry or phone as to which case we should send to TCPL, I would get that to them before the holiday so they could work on it Thursday and Friday.

*	Case 1 is an 8% distribution growth case (starting with the plan and increasing acquisition activity to deliver 8% growth).  To achieve that our total capex for NBP goes up to an average of just over $400 million per year.
*	Case 2 tracks with our budget case and involves about $200 million in capex per year and results in 2 years of 8% growth and then a flat distribution level for the remaining 3 years.
*	Case 3 utilizes the budget case but eliminates all acquisitions (capex is about $30 - $40 million average per year for maintenance and asset development) and assumes NBPL recontracting occurs at 85% of max rates.  The result is distributions increase to $3.30 in 2002 and stay at that level throughout the 5 year period.

Obviously Case 1 is the most aggressive in terms of valuation among the three.  Please let me know if that is ok to send or do you have something else in mind.  Also I could fax hard copies if you would like...

 <<Valuation Cases11-18.zip>> 

We need to get this done.  What other resources do you need to get this dea=
l done.

My apologies - I obviously misunderstood the message from last week.  I sho=
uld have called you to discuss before firing off my memo.  We are doing eve=

including financing our Dutch blade facility.  We are working to put in pla=

I know the value Phil has brought to this effort.  I also know his plate is full and I am glad you will assisting him on getting the EOTT problem under control.  PLEASE keep me updated.

Stan - 

Phil forwarded (to me) your response (see below) to the e mail he had sent regarding the Robin Border memo. I concur with your thoughts on trust and will continue my efforts in that regard. 

'Thanks for the update.  Doesn't appear as Robin is helping out any.  I am not sure why Dana values his opinions so much on this topic.  Keep working the progress.  The key people you need to make happy are Robert and Dan.  I trust that Mike is developing a effective relationship with them and Dana.  Trust is essential in making this partnership work.'  

I've been meeting with a nunber of the ETS folks that have been working on EOTT issues and assignments, and although we have been working hard, we simply have some additional work to do in the areas of communication, which I will address and facilitate. We meet with the commercial folks on Tuesday after the normal EOTT Staff Meeting regarding the Enhanced Integrity Plan, where we can hopefully move forward. In addition, I will put together a presentation outlining the 2002 EOTT Integrity Plan for presentation the next time the commercial folks meet. It will also include facts of our on-going remediation plan and  hydrotest / pigging efforts for 2001.     

In my opinion, the EOTT operations assignment has been a challenge for ETS. ETS - and Phil in particular - has dedicated tremendous effort to significantly enhance EOTT operations. Few could have tackled the EOTT operational challenges as well as Phil has. Besides the fact that it may not have been a popular decision at EOTT to relinquish control of Operations, he has done an outstanding job in keeping his staff focused on performance with integrity and quality, all the time within a financial framework that adds value to the overall picture of Enron and EOTT. It has not been easy. I am confident you recognize how well he has changed the face of operations in ETS and EOTT as you have changed the face of both organizations overall.

Best wishes for a good Thanksgiving.

Yes the weather has turned somewhat colder.  Busy day.  Call tonight. Love you.

Dad

Hi there!!!  I hope you are having a good day  (or at least as good as is possible on a Monday!!!).  Nothing exciting here  to report.  The weather is dreary and windy and getting very cold.   Has it hit in Houston yet?  Well, getting ready to do some homework and go  to my last class.  I love you and will talk to you later.
Love,

Given our limited corporate resources, can we cut the IT newsletter?

Please visit the latest issue of the ETS IT newsletter at:

http://www.ets.enron.com/ITNewsletter/default.asp

Thanks.

Ken has forwarded to me your letter of October 18 wherein you asked how Enron wanted to handle several activities which you are now engaged (Trojan nuclear plant decommissioning, contract review for offshore sales and rep agreements and involvement in Transparency International).

Ken has asked me to work with you on this.  Please let me know a good time to discuss.  Thank you.

Stan Horton

We cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown.  I am looking to you to insure that one does not happen.

Rick Craig
04/26/2001 07:51 PM
Stan, thanks for the comments.  With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.  I'm a little bit surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.  Obviously something broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.  

Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told you that I don't have the same concern.  Phil and I discussed this at some length but since his work on the international side was winding down and Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.  Don and I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could handle it.  I plan to stay on top of it.  If I see the communications and/or relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal with them quickly through the performance mangement process.  Hope this answers your questions.  

    

Stanley Horton

Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one of Lohitt's strong skills,

The pipeline segment pre-GISB Board of Directors conference call is scheduled for Tuesday, December 4, 2001, 4:00 - 5:00 p.m. Central Time.  The conference call number is 800-991-9019; pass code is 7734948.

The agenda for the GISB Board of Directors meeting is not available.  The main topic will be the vote on revisions to the Bylaws, which are based on Strawman 2.1.

Thanks,
Theresa

Thanks.  To date I haven't heard anything from GISB.

Stan,

If you're still on GISB's Editorial Review Board, you should receive a communication from GISB this week or early next week.

The pipeline segment has discovered numerous substantive errors in version 1.5 of the GISB standards, which were published last August.  We have requested that GISB correct the books and send the corrected publication to the FERC.  The Editorial Review Board will probably be asked to review the correspondence that will be sent to the FERC.

I was involved in the pipeline segment effort.  Please let me know if you need further information or would like me to review the FERC correspondence when you receive it.  GISB has agreed to take specific actions that were requested by the pipeline segment.

Thanks,
Theresa

That is your call.  I am trying to make sure everyone is looking at their group and properly assessing where we can become more efficient.  You have to way the benefits vs. cost.

We created the framework for the newsletter within ETS.  Now it only takes limited time from a staff level individual to put it together. There were, and are, no corporate resources used in its creation or publication.

We were looking to keep business as usual, especially as relating to communication, but given our extraordinary circumstances will stop publication if you think it more appropriate.

Please advise.

Thank you.

Given our limited corporate resources, can we cut the IT newsletter?

Please visit the latest issue of the ETS IT newsletter at:

http://www.ets.enron.com/ITNewsletter/default.asp

Thanks.

I thought we should review the process with Mark and Jeff first.  I will go ahead and invite either Jeff or Ray.

Stan:

Shouldn't Ray Bowen or Jeff McMahon participate?

Jim

Would you be available for a one hour meeting with Stan next Monday, November 26, at 4:00PM in ECN 5020?

Please advise.

Thanks.  That means alot.

Stan - Thanks for the kind message.  These are indeed challenging times and I can only imagine how difficult it has been on you to see the impact it has had on our company.  Please know that we continue to be focused and dedicated to "doing the best in everything we do."  

Please enjoy the holiday especially the time spent w/ your children.

Thanks.  John D. 

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan 

Agree.  We could waste alot of time with Candover and not get anywhere.

Adam,

The current thinking (and we just spoke with Chris Spencer about an hour ago) is to prepare for an auction while trying to get Candover in a position to moot an auction.  They have identified some folks that they would want to be involved in the project with them and would like them to meet us and you, probably next week.  Amit will be calling to coordinate schedules.

But I WILL not put all my eggs in the Candover basket, and that is why we need to prepare for an auction as well when we ready.

Take care, 
Mark

I do not know them and, from the e-mail, it sounds like they are only interested in North American development assets.  Adam

By the way, what is your current thinking on the sale process.  Going to give Candover a semi-exclusive or will we go to an auction process with multiple bidders? 

Who are these guys?  By the way, I have made contact with Scottish Power/Pacificorp.  They seem more interested in the development business, but I promised to keep in touch.  Take care, Mark

more expressions of interest.  This one doesn't excite me.  Adam
Larry -- I don't know what the plans are for Enron Wind given recent events.  However, I've cc'd Adam Umanoff, the CEO at Enron Wind, to introduce the two of you.  Please feel free to follow up with him directly.
 
Adam -- I met Larry at a NREL conference a few weeks ago.  Larry runs a small start-up that is developing a behind-the-tower design which allows for lower cost construction.  Even if his contemplated transaction is of no interest, you may enjoy learning about his technology.
 
Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
 
Thanks

Hello Heath,
 
Thanks for returning my call.
 
The Wind Turbine Company (WTC) is interested in exploring the possiblity of taking over Enron Wind Corporation with the idea of selling off the European operations and all existing manufacturing operations.  We are interested in the company's North American wind operations and the properties held for development.
 
As you know, WTC is a small company, however, we are talking with a few large companies about investing in our company and prospectively taking an active role in the wind industry.  Enron Wind's existing windfarms would form an excellent operating base for us, providing properties to develop, and significant opportunities to deploy our new machines through the redevelopment of projects now employing the European style machine.
 
I would appreciate any guidance you provide.
 
Best regards,
 
Larry Miles

Thanks Mitch.  I have 18 month old twins who could care less about my distractions.  They are my stress outlet now.  Happy Thanksgiving.

Thanks for the note Stan.  It is nice to know that with all of the distractions within our company lately you still recognize the things we should be thankful for.  I know you have your hands full with the current situation, but I hope you take time to enjoy the holidays with your family and friends as well.

Sincerely,
Mitch Meyer

This does conflict with a meeting I have in Washington D>C> with Nortwest Natural that Dick asked for.  Your call on rescheduling the meeting with Candover.

fyi.....  Stan, if you need us to move the Houston meeting around, let me know.  Thanks.

FYI.  We have not yet sent this to Candover as we are waiting for confirmation on Stan's availability.

30 days is acceptable.  This is extremely important to us.

You asked for a time line on securing this quote.  

I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.  

Lou,  I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.  As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier  with what I have to offer them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.  

After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 days..I will shoot for better than that.  I feel however that this quote/due diligence will be much more intensive on their part  given their experience with EOTT,  I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time frame.  Is 30 days acceptable? 

 Hope this answers your questions.  If not please let me know.

Thanks Frank.  I will look over the resumes but given Enron's current condition we are not doing any new development projects outside of the pipelines and are relying on Corporate Development to assist with asset sales.  Given all that I don't believe I have a spot for anyone.  Quite frankly, I am concerned about keeping all that I have.

Stan - 

Attached are the resumes of the key people that have worked with me for the last year and half.  They are Marc Hensel, Martin Sacchi, Bradford Brooks and Corbin Barnes.  I believe they are some of the brightest commercial people at Enron, and in particular have a lot of experience with corporate development, M&A, asset purchases and sales (including international experience).  They are also incredibly hard working people.  

Please let me know if your interested, or feel free to contact them directly.

Frank

Given where we are I tend to agree with theswe statements.

I agree with Morris.  Little value to the pipes
Rod, Stan is/was reviewing selected "corp." services, and one of those selected was GSS. I requested that Morris provide some persepective on GSS.   Please review and forward to Stan, if appropriate. 

Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

*	The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
*	Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
*	ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
*	New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
*	Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
*	GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
*	ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.

If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

*	Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
*	Two (2) analysts
*	Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

*	iBuyit System
*	Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
*	iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

Morris 

(713) 503-1409

No problem at all.

Stan

Please accept my sincere apologies for interupting your meeting with Aaron Brown (not something I would usually ever consider doing).

Please set this up for Monday.

Stan:

I spoke to Mike Miller regarding the opportunity in Enron Wind.  He is interested in the position and would be willing to meet with you as early as next Monday.  Mike can be reached at x36556 or his cell (713) 628-5958. Hope this helps.

Kevin

Sorry but it is Enron's policy not to comment on these types of things.  Rest assured that we have very experienced people who are evaluating  offers we receive for any asset. Thank you.

Mr. Horton:

I understand that we recently rejected a cash offer for the wind company from a J.P.Morgan-backed group for approximately $400m. My understanding is that we have been trying to sell this company almost since we bought it, that the price is much higher than our cost basis, and that we definitely need the liquidity for our core businesses.  Are we reconsidering ?

Trey
x36060

Ok, but please expedite. Also, you should be aware that Todd has informed me of his need to pursue going on short-term disability.  We are looking at internal candidates to serve as the CFO for the interim period as we seek to seel Enron Wind.  You will of cource have input into the decision.  My first interview is Monday with a Mike Miller who is in corporate development.  I will keep you informed.

Stan - we have commenced an investigation of Toman's concerns. At this stage, I do not know whether he is a disgruntled employee blowing off steam or whether these are serious concerns (or maybe a little of both).  I will let you know what we learn.  For now, I do not think you need to send out an audit team - let us find out whether there is any substance here.  Adam   

What is going on here?  I think I need to send out my operational assessment team to do an audit.  Please advise immediately.

Eric and Darrell - Please investigate these complaints.  Joseph (who I do not know) is raising discrimination concerns as well as safety concerns.   Darrell - also send a written message to Joseph letting him know that his concerns have been brought to your attention and that we will take appropriate action to investigate.  Eric - you may want to drop Jim Derrick a note (since Key Lay was copied on this) and give him a heads-up.  Thanks. Adam

Stan,

I wanted to thank you again for your guidance through my recent organizational changes.  I want you to know that I am in firm support of wherever you carry the flag, no matter what it may say on that flag.  If you need me and my team to take a hill, we'll make it happen.

Others in the group appreciated my staying, as presented in the following notes, but I would not have been in the position to make this decision without your support.

You and the family have a well deserved Happy Thanksgiving.

Appreciatively,
Steve

Steve,

I am glad you are staying with our group.  I feel very confident with your leadership.

Thanks,
Sandra Cernoch

Steve, I am glad to know that you will be with us through this tough time. Thanks for all that you do.

Joanne

Welcome back!  We need you!!

I am very glad you are staying!!!

It's great news having you stay.
Larry

SWEET!!!

Steve, I hope you are not disappointed, because I am sure I speak for the majority in saying we did not want you to leave us.  Thanks for staying.

Glad to hear this.  Good move
Don

Steve,

This is a good thing in my opinion.  

Steve,

	Although you were probably looking forward to the excitement of the new opportunity, I'm glad that you're staying with us.  My team looks forward to helping you succeed in bringing the pipeline groups to new technological heights.

James

Thank you Frank.  That means alot.

Stan,

Thanks for thinking of us during these trying times.  In light of the Enron issues I realize how hard it must have been for you to enjoy your time with your family for thanksgiving. To let you and those that must manage these hard times know,  you all are in my thoughts and prayers, and I wish you well.

Sincerely,
Frank Acuff

Good days are now impossible!

Hi there!!  How's your day going - busy and  stressful as usual??  My day is going ok - nothing exciting to  report.  I had a nice holiday and enjoyed spending some time with you and  visiting with Grandma Bettye.  Have a good day, and I'll talk to you  tonight.

Congratulations on your test.  Proud of you.  Everyday is tough.  I can't tell you what its like other than tough.  Love, Dad

Hi there Dad!!  How's today shaping up to be....better than yesterday I
hope??  My day has been okay.  Good news...I got a 23 out of a possible 25
on my b. law test from right before thanksgiving.  What the good grade means
is that I'm still making a strong A in there (a 94 I think) so I'm a very
happy girl.  Other than that my day has been quiet.  It's really getting
cold here and has been really windy which makes it seem colder.  I'm sure
you are getting this great weather as well by now so warning it's really
chilly.  Poor David went out to his car today and discovered he had a flat
tire from a nail that he must have picked up yesterday when we went to the
grocery store.  He's having AAA come fix it.  That's about all the exciting
news I have to report today.  I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!!!!!!!!
Love,
Caron

Thanks.  Right now I know of no available opportunities but will keep you in mind.

Dear Stan,

Given the current state of affairs here in the D.C. office, I am forwarding my resume for your review.  The lion's share of my legal experience has been with Enron's regulated pipelines, both domestic and overseas.  I appreciate your keeping me in mind should needs or opportunities arise in the pipeline group, whether these be as an employee or on a contract basis.

Thanks for your consideration!  

Kindest regards,  Ray

 << File: Resume2.doc >> 

I think we should talk with them if the have the cash.  However, I get very=
 nervous when anyone would commit $100 to $200 million with limited due dil=
igence.  Also, I would not want to announce anything until the deal closes.=
  Preannouncing a deal of this size isn't goi8ng to stabilize anything.  $1=
 to $2 BILLION might get a different answer.  As to your involvement, you m=
ade the right call.

Stan/Jeff:

I have been contacted by a number of close friends/business contacts that w=
ant to put together a deal to buy a number of our smaller assets, primarily=
 the power assets.  The strategy they have in mind is simple.  They want to=
 offer us a lightning quick sale of a package of small non-core assets that=
 together would be a material deal that could be announced and help stabili=
se our situation.  They would then be able to manage in a more orderly mann=
er either the sale or continued operation of the assets and hopefully reali=
se a premium over what they pay us.  They have power and energy industry ex=
perience.  In the interest of full disclosure, they asked me to participate=
 in the deal, but I have said that probably makes a negotiated deal unlikel=
y given the related party concerns.  I indicated if they want to do a deal,=
 they will have to leave me out of it. They have indicated a willingness to=
 conduct due diligence over ten days, sign an agreement and announce the de=
al and then close by end of the year, but only if we can begin immediately.=
  They are assuming we would put a priority on both announcing and funding =
a deal quickly.  They are willing to structure around issues to meet this o=
bjective.

I intend to meet with these guys and make my own judgement as to the legiti=
macy of the proposal.  I think they are considering a transaction of betwee=
n 100 - 200 million.  It would probably involve a half dozen or so assets. =
 Not a huge deal, but it would efficiently get rid of some cats and dogs.  =
It probably qualifies as a "fire sale", but might make sense anyway.

Your thoughts?

Jim

You have my permission to just refer them to Jeff Donahue.  Jeff is in the process of naming individuals to assist in the disposition of our international assets.  Corporate development, EGAS and investment bankers will collectively pursue the disposition.  I woould think Dr. Boyce should be so advised of the process we are going to use.  Jeff or his designee can deliver this message if you would like.

Jeff, I assume this is the right approach given our converstion.

Jim/Stan;
See below; this is simply further illustration of the problems we will continue to have with this gentleman.  He has simply received royal treatment in terms of the expediency with which information has been provided to him.  I have met with him twice already and have spoken to him on the phone at least three times.  Clearly, based on the email below he is trying to line up investors to do this deal.  You know what my recommendation on this is; I have simply wanted to take a very courteous and responsive approach on this out of respect for the relationship.

Let me know how your mtg with Corp Development went.

Thanks! Mariella
ps: fyi - after fulfilling his round of requests (which came up on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving) I asked if he could please focus on: how to deal with the backstop guarantees that ENE has in the deal and a financing plan (I politely told him we were looking at an all-cash transaction).  

I sent this at 6:30 and I just resent - we have to get rid of them

Steve
We have still not received the information.  I cannot understand why the
same information released to the other parties cannot be released to us.  I
have a number of investors scheduled for a meeting Tuesday morning at 9:00
am, and am very disappointed that I do not have the information as of 7:00pm

   -----Original Message-----

I am ok with this.  Bill has done a good job.

Dear GISB Board Members,

Bill  Boswell,  Hugh  Roberts  and  Julie Gomez, GISB's chairman, first and
second vice chairs, respectively, assumed office at the March 2001 meeting.
Under  established  guidelines Hugh would have become the 2002 chairman and
Julie  the  first vice chair; however, due to a reassignment, Hugh resigned
from the board and GISB was left without a first vice chairman.

The  Producer Segment directors have informed the GISB Office they have not
yet decided on a replacement for Hugh as first vice chairman, but in any
event none of them desire to  assume  the Chairmanship in March 2002.
Likewise, Julie Gomez has also declined  to  assume the Chairmanship,
although she is willing to remain as
vice  chairman  for  the  coming  year.   Therefore,  the  Producer Segment
directors and Julie Gomez of the Services Segment, are requesting Bill
Boswell to
continue  as  chairman throughout 2002, and these segments will then resume
their  rotation at the end of Bill's extended term.  This is similar to the
situation  which  occurred  when Steve Chesebro' continued as chairman from
June  1994  to  March 1996, after which, Mary Jane McCartney rotated to the
chairmanship.

Bill  Boswell  was  asked  and has agreed to do so long as it was clear the
request  was  from  the Producer Segment as next in line for the chair, and
provided Julie Gomez as second in line also requested this to be handled in
that manner.  This has been done with both the producer directors and Julie
also requesting this issue be clarified now so as to provide GISB and NAESB
with clear continuity into next year.

Pursuant  to  the bylaws, the existing officers will continue through 2002;
therefore,   Bill   Boswell   will  continue  as  chairman,  the  producers
subsequently  will  name  a  first vice chair in place of Hugh Roberts, and
Julie Gomez will remain as second vice chair.

I look forward to seeing you in Houston or hearing from you over the phone on
December 5 -- Best Regards, Rae

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% -  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

Regards,

Henry

Yes, please go ahead and send the documents to David.

We are going to need Morgan Stanley to review these documents.  They also
are going to need to sign the trust agreements.

Shall I follow-up directly with David Hill on that?  I assume yes but wanted
to check with you.

SD

Of cource. It is always good visiting with you.  See you soon.

Hi Stan, 
I really enjoyed talking with you and Debbie at Cliff's party.  I didn't get  
a chance to tell her goodbye - will you please give her my best? 
Thanks. 
Beth Stier

I have no idea what this project is so an update would be appreciated.  Please set something up with my assistant Cindy Stark.  Thanks.

We are in the process of closing with US Bank on our financing for the
construction of the first phase of this project for $13 million.  We are
working with the Enron Corp. - Corporate Financing group to obtain a corporate
guarantee for the financing.  This project is currently in PGH2 and is part of
what is being sold with PGE.  The financing guarantee will contemplate this
sale and will allow for the assignment of the guarantee to the new buyer as
long as they meet an agreed upon financial standards (ie. BBB+).  Since we are
under ETS you or Stan might get questions on the project and I wanted to
provide you an overview of the project.

Mahendra Shah of our treasury group has had a conversation with Greg Caudell
and Jim Newgard (both report to Tm Despain) at Enron Corp. Corporate Finance
about the Enron Guaranty for the US Bank construction facility (up to $13
million). He has forwarded to them, the US bank's draft of the Enron guaranty.
 They indicated that the guaranty would probably be redrafted by Clement
Abrams using the standard Enron format.  
 
If you have any questions on the District Cooling Project or need additional
information we can set up a conference call and go over the various aspects of
the project.  We also have the financial model available that we can forward
to you that was reviewed and was the basis of Enron's approval.

I figured this posting belonged to one of you.  Please see the message from Danny Jones.

recommendation or referral to ETS technology department. Anything you could
do to help further my goals would be appreciated.

First of all congratulations on completing your degree.  Having completed my Masters degree by going to school at nights and Saturdays while working full time I know first hand the commitment that takes.  I suggest that you work through Mary Ellen in trying to find the right position.  She knows Gary Smith, VP of HR for ETS.  Between the two of them they should be able to offer you the right advise.  Keep me informed.

Stan,

I had the opportunity to participate in the Table Talk session yesterday at
EOTT and want to follow up with you on the topic of employee growth and
development.  Thanks to EOTT's tuition reimbursement program, I will be
completing my undergraduate degree this summer at UST (although I "walked"
two weeks ago).  My degree is in General Studies (concentrations in
Business Administration and International Studies).  I am graduating Summa
Cum Laudeand received the Outstanding Graduate award in my degree program,
along with honors in English, Philosophy and Adult Education.  I intend to
start the MBA program at UST in Spring 2002.

I would like to find a position within your organization where I can learn
the business, provide value to the company as well as advance myself.  I
mention that I am graduating with honors not to pat myself on the back but
to impress upon you that I will apply the same focus and desire for
excellence in any position I undertake.  Naturally, I would like to stay
within the Enron companies not only because I have 7 years invested
already, but because Enron is the place to work and grow.  I am open to any
position where there is an opportunity for learn, grow and advance.  As
with my studies, I find the more I become aware of and learn, the more I
want to learn.  I know I could do a great job within an organization given
the opportunity.

Any advice or assistance in finding a position or internship would be
greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Autumn R. Cartier

Call my assistant, Cindy Stark and set up an appointment.

Stan,

Since returning to Enron, I have been working in ENA's Upstream Business Unit.  For the past year we have been pursuing infrastructure opportunities in the deepwater GOM.  The infrastructure projects consisted of deepwater pipelines and floating production systems such as spars or tension leg platforms.  Recently, ENA has re-evaluated its business strategy in deepwater and is questioning the amount of exposure ENA should take given its ownership position in Mariner.  ENA may not view offshore infrastructure as a strategic business opportunity for Enron.  

I would like to meet with you to discuss current and future deepwater project developments in the Gulf of Mexico.  These projects may represent a significant opportunity for EOTT.  I have worked with EOTT extensively to determine the best crude oil export option for each projects.  

In addition, if ENA determines that deepwater infrastructure projects are not strategic, I would be interested in your opinion regarding opportunities with ETS for someone with my experience.  I have attached my resume for your convenience.

Could your administration assistant call and set up a time for the brief meeting?

Thanks .... Kevin Miller

     

     

Nasim Khan is due to rotate back to the states very soon.  He at one time worked for TW.  He has experience in Business Development.  Please give him some time when he calls to see if he can be of some value to our business development efforts.

Stan:
It was good to see you last week. I will be in Houston on June 29th, July 2nd and 9th. I would like to take this opportunity to meet with any one you think I should be meeting with. I am looking forward to again working with you.

regards,

Nasim Khan  

Thanks.  You made my day.  I think she is kind of special so its nice to hear good things about her.  See you tomorrow.

Stan - just wanted to drop a quick note.  Karen is a delight in our office --
smart, easy to work with, and always busy.  I am so pleased that you
mentioned she would be available. Thanks for helping our office run more
smoothly -- Rae

Chris, Steve got us a tee time at 7:52 am Saturday on the OLD course starting on #10 tee box.  I have told him you will play. See you Tomorrow.

Stan

Did anyone make a tee-time for golf this weekend.  I can play Saturday as long as we are done by @ pm or any time on Sunday.  Please let me know.  I can make a t-time but I am not sure what we will get at this late date.

Lunch is not good this week.  I have a business lunch tomorrow.  Thursday is the GISB Board meeting.  Are you going?  I"ll give you a ride there and to your car afterwards if you do not need to come back downtown to work.  Let me know.

Dad

Good morning.  How are you today?  Mom told me you called last night and would be at EOTT all day, but I know you can get your email there.  :)  So how does the rest of the week look for lunch?  Are you free Wed. or Thurs.?  Let me know.  Next week I'll be gone to Regionals!!  I can't believe it has come up so fast.  I can't wait, but I also remember just how unpredictable Regionals can be so I don't want to get my hopes up about anything.  Of course, my two kids are being little angels which is making me feel pretty good about my chances so we'll see what happens.  Well, I better go do some actual work (although no one is even here yet so I'm not sure what exactly I'm supposed to do this morning), but oh well.  I'll talk to you later.  Have a good day.  I love you!!!
Love,
Caron
PS - Hopefully I will get my paycheck today!!!!!!  :)

It is a bad day getting worse.  Any more questions about how I am doing?  If it rains I am going out and standing in it because it will mean my day is actually improving.  Talk with you later.

Daddy

Good morning.  How are you today?  I'm good but tired.  I was very happy to see it was no longer raining this morning although I think there is still a good chance of rain today.  I'm sure if it does rain it will wait till 5pm so I have to walk to the bus in it but oh well.  I do have my umbrella (for whatever good that will do me!!).  Thanks again for the ride home yesterday.  I love you and hope you have a good day.  I'll talk to you later.
Love,
Caron

The name sounds ok to me.  Better than EOTTMTBE<LP et al.

For Project Timber, we need to pick the name for the partnership.  It does not have to be formed by Friday, but we need a name to put in the letter to State Street Bank and Trust.   What about EOTT Clean Fuels, L.P.?  Please let me know as soon as possible.  Note:since this partnership is only in Texas, we do not need to spell out Limited Partnership.  Thanks.

Ok with me.

There apparently was a proposal made at the last VP PRC Committee meeting to retitle the Commercial Support peer group to "Professional Services" (see note below).  Let me know if you are opposed to this, otherwise I will indicate ETS' support for this change later this week.
Gary

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

David

Ok.  Contact Cindy Stark to make an appointment.

I will know our schedule better next week.  I would hope we could execute before the end of June at the latest.  I will email you again on Monday.  Thanks.

We're in real good shape here on the documents, as we've already pretty much
made the changes you note below.  We're also already into our internal
review process, so we should be ready to go in short order when that review
work is done.  We can be ready for you to sign our documents next week.  My
problem is that I'm out of town all next week.  Do you want to schedule a
meeting after that to execute, say the week of June 18-22, if that suits the
schedule of the prenup lawyers?  I'd like to be there when you sign to make
sure all is right and also to discuss related beneficiary designations on
nonprobate assets.

I'd like to see the marital property agreement before you sign it.

SD

Debbie is meeting with her attorney on Friday regarding the post marital
agreement modification.  I do not think it is much of an issue so we
should get revision executed very soon.

I have gone through the Agreement again and they look fine.  My notes
indicate only the following changes need to be made:

1.  Caron's portion of the inheritance if I die first should be the
lesser of 5% or $3million and she pays the tax due;

2.  The house I own at 9302 Cypresswood Drive together with all
furnishings etc would be left to Debbie instead of the marital trust;
and,

3. J> P> Morgan/Chase Bank would be an alternate to MSDW as trustee.

What is the next step?

I have secured a tee time for Saturday at 9:52 am for the New Course.  If I hear from Steve or Tom that they have a tee time already I will email you.  So check your email tomorrow and I will confirm the time or call me tomorrow evening if that is more convenient.  I look forward to playing given the mastery of the game I exhibited over the final 9 holes last week.

Stan,
Saturday is great with me... I can not make Sunday.
Even if the tee time you get for us is not ideal...please count me in...

I got the Board book and note.  Thanks, it made my day.  I will be glad to take you to the Board meeting, and to the park & ride or home which ever you prefer.  Call me tonight.

Daddy

That's cool about lunch.  My tummy is feeling pretty gross anyway so it's best that I just live off salads and sandwiches this week anyway.  I am supposed to go to the meeting on Thursday, and would greatly appreciate a ride there and home.  After the meeting would you drive me to my car or home because I can get Mom to take me to the bus in the morning on Thursday if you'd rather take me home than drive all the way to the park&ride.  It's up to you, just let me know what's easier for you.  Did you get your board book yet for the meeting?  I mailed them all out this morning and put a little note for you in yours.  :)  I hope you're having a good day.  I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!
Love,

Dana wins.

I, too, thought EOTT MTBE LP was a bit much.  Sounds like a bad sitcom.

Dana wants to use EOTT Energy Liquids, L.P.  If no one objects, I will give that name to Ann Ballard on Friday to put in the letter to State Street.  We will form the partnership as soon as we clear up the structure issues, which I hope will be next week.

Q2 needs to be on plan.  Work hard!

Thanks for your note.  Agreed that execution on IMI and II (construction, debt and equity closings) are the key for the Americas.  It looks like we will have slippage for Q2; I am expecting to see European numbers later this morning and will give you a call to discuss on Friday.  We can also discuss the gearbox issues for the US as to which I am a bit more optimistic than my earlier reports.  Adam

It sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.  The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.  The real target is completion of the project on time.

I am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and German installations being behind schedule.  I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.

What is the issue on the L&S gearbox and what is the potential impact on 01 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test, it will present significant problems for 01 US sales.

Let's talk by phone this week if possible.

Count me in.  See you tomorrow.
Tee off is 7:52 #10 Old. That's if Allison cooperates!

Thank you.  I feel I have neglected Wessex and you with all that is going on.  The truth is that John, Michael and you are very capable of proceeding with little input from me.  I did make sure with Corporate Development that Michael had to be involved along with you and your team.  Communication here is not the greatest so please keep me updated.  Thanks.

Stan

As with you I guess, the week has been dominated by the fall out from the
Enron problems.  We have focused on reassuring suppliers, customers and
employees that Wessex Water will continue to trade as a viable business.

We have agreed a way forward with Mark Muller and Michael Anderson on the
potential sale of Wessex.  The intention is a package deal that involves the
buyer of Wessex first dealing with the Azurix high yield bonds.

Enron/Azurix are appointing a bank to handle the process.  We have three
serious contenders - WestLB, RBS and Barclays.  Due diligence will start at
the end of next week/beginning of the following week.

I will keep you posted.

Gary, I have a question and I can't seem to get a real good answer so I will ask you.

I have quite a lot of money in the stable asset fund that I am told I cannot get until I terminate. My question is this, Where is that money? Is it safe from all that is going on? is it with some other company in some type of trust? Is it safe from being used by the company officers? What happens to it if I survive the merger? What happens to it if bankruptcy occurs?

Any help you can give me about this would be appreciated.

thanks    al

Thanks Mike.  Should have known you were in control of the situation.  By the way, how are you doing with all of this?

Stan - Gary had originally (and promptly) forwarded Al's question to Ann for assistance, and I believe Ann was able to satisfy Al by working through the 800 phone number. The problem was really in the inadequate number of qualified people who answer questions on benefits.

Please call to set up a meeting.  We should include Michael Anerson in the call.  There are updates that I need to provide you with.

As you know, I have been expressing concern about the need for momentum with
the sale.  I understand we still don't have a bank in place and I know that
at least two of the bidders are beginning to feel that they are being used
simply to encourage others.

We have on the table three serious bids at or around RAB value - which is
better than we might have expected.  I understand RBS are now considering
talking to Barclays to bring them into a single bid which would not be good
for the competitive process.

We need to move quickly for a number of reasons:-

1	Keeping these guys interested.
2	There is an opportunity now to take out the high yield bond.
3	We need to get the deal done well before AEL refinancing is
required.

It seems to me we have three ways forward:-

1	Find an independent bank - there are UK banks such as Close Brothers
who are smaller but do not have any Enron issues.  They would be more than
capable of carrying out the sale process and we could leave the high yield
bonds with SSSB or CSFB.

2	Proceed without a bank - this carries the risk that we won't have a
fairness opinion.

3	Satisfy ourselves that one or maybe a combination of banks can carry
out the process without claims of undue influence.

I propose to arrange the first management presentations on Friday of this
week and Monday and Tuesday of next week because I believe it is essential
that we maintain momentum.  Let's sort out the bank issues before then.

Thanks. Please make sure Bob Kelley is on the list.

Happy Holidays to you and your Staff.  Selling Wessex is the rifht move for everyone.  I am glad that things arew going well.  @et me know if I can be of help.
Stan

The Wessex sale process seems to be proceeding well.  So far we have made
presentations to Barclays, RBS, WestLB, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, ENEL
and Candover.  There should be another six or seven early in the new year
with the aim of getting firm bids by about 18 January.

We are trying to kill any media interest although with so many people
involved this is always going to be difficult.  Michael Anderson has been
doing a great job in co-ordinating the process.

Meanwhile, in the real world, the business is going pretty well although we
are running through a very dry period at a time when we would expect to be
achieving groundwater recharge.  We are having to utilise more expensive
river sources to rest the groundwater and provide security for the summer.

Have a good holiday.

I wish you the best over the holidays and long into the future.  Thank you for taking the time to attend the Christmas party and to visit with the staff in the Maitland office.  I'm forever impressed by the priority you place on meeting with the field locations.  The fact that you were able to do so during this difficult time is commendable.  We're rooting for your success at turning things around.
Thank you,

I doubt anybody wants that to happen.  This issue is are we now at the point that Enron Wind cannot generate enough cash to meet its own requirements.

Good news - The creditors' committee is okay with the sale of the project on current price and terms.

Bad news -  The creditors' committee wants all of the net cash to go to the estate (I had proposed that we keep enough of the net cash at EW in order to fund our expected WC needs through sale of the company).  We are now negotiating for a freeze on the net cash (through Jan 7) pending a presentation by Enron and CSFB (next week) as to why it is in the estate's best interest to allow EW to operate as a going concern in order to maximize value to the estate on sale of the business.  Mark is on board for this presentation.

Bottom line - if we do not have access to a significant portion of the net cash from this sale, I will not be able to keep the business going through a Q1 sale.  Bad result for all involved.  

I will give you a further update when we talk this afternoon.

who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

Peter Percell <percell@swbell.net> on 04/30/2001 11:16:58 AM
I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

I don't like the answer tho the last question.  Can we add that under the agreements we could cancel as early as (date) but no decision has been made with regards when actual termination would occur?
Per discussions with Wade, we understand that the transfer notice should be given this weekend.  Given the potential for this to add to the stories about Enron, we plan to get review and support for or communication strategy from investor relations and corporate communications in advance of this activity.  Consequently, attached is a proposed statement that Johan, Jimmy and I prepared.  Your early comments and approval would be appreciated.  As soon as we have an approved text, we will share it with our corporate contacts and also intend to alert them to this possibility today.

Thanks,

John

How much does putting out the newsletter cost?  How often are you proposing to put it out?  Does it replace any other newsletters?  Is there any new information in the newsletter or just restatements of what Ken, Mark and Greg have already said?  Need to make sure we have included Brian Stanley's group in what constitutes EGS.  Especially NEPCO.  

Stan,

With the formation of EGS, as well as all of the recent activity affecting the company, we feel that it is important to initiate an EGS newsletter to keep employees informed and motivated.  The most cost-effective and timely way of doing this is through e-mail, backed up with an intranet version and hard copies (in most cases printed off locally) for those employees who do not have PCs.  The newsletter would supplement other communication channels, such as messages from you, eSpeak, floor meetings, site visits, your periodic meetings and normal management communication.  

We would like to see how much news and interest we have before making a final determination, but would expect this newsletter to go out once or twice a month.  In addition to English, we intend to provide Spanish and Portuguese versions.   We will work to assist local management if they feel that other languages are needed for their operations.

Attached for your review is the proposed text for the first edition.  We believe a message from you and summary of the business units/operations in EGS is the appropriate content for the first edition.  In future editions we would expect to also cover business developments and news of interest to employees.  A template of our proposed design for the newsletter is also attached.  Any comments on the text or concept, as well as your approval to proceed would be greatly appreciated.  Of course, I am available at your convenience if you want to discuss this.

Thank you,

John

Lets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything.  I believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload.  I have always believed that if we have an effective Corporate newsletter we don't need these subsidiary newsletters.  Meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter.  At ETS we used to have periodic FYI newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover.

You and I also need to do a budget review.  The cost I am hearing from your group are to big for EGS to support.  I had truly hoped that Gina's group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover EGS.  Gina's group was covering ETs and EOTT.  I think Adam has a PR person so we need to find out what PR costs are in the Wind company.  Also NBP's has there own PR person.

Please set up a meeting with Cindy and Tracy.

Thanks

Since this newsletter will be sent via e-mail, there is little non-employee related expense.  We will be using existing staff and making this additional employee communication part of our assignments.  Translations, graphics, web support and printing should collectively be under $10,000 per year. (If a subsidiary decided to copy/reproduce for their hourly employees, they would have additional costs.)
Initially we would shoot for every three to four weeks, but this could change depending on interest and content.
This would not replace any other newsletters, but it might result in less local writing costs or redundant news in the EGS businesses.  We expect that Enron corp. vehicles like eBiz would draw from the newsletter for some of their content for the broader Enron audience.  This may  help in getting EGS employees to see themselves as part of a team rather than assets for sale.
Most of the information in the newsletter would be original. The 13,000 EGS employees can benefit from hearing from their chairman, occasional recognition and learning about other units' activities.  We plan to efficiently use our resources in developing this material, since the same effort will assist us in our necessary preparations for both external and internal audiences. 
We had not done the final check of the businesses and it was an oversight leaving out Brian Stanley's groups.  We will include them.

Are you comfortable with the responses outlined above?   If so, we would like to proceed, but need to  ensure that the approach in the chairman's letter is acceptable to you.  Your comments, when you have time, would be appreciated.

I have it on my calendar and Debbie would like to come also.  The plane can only fit so many so be careful you don't over invite if they are counting on the plane for transportation.

Thanks.

Stan - We would like to invite you and Debbie to our Christmas party December 7 at the Western Heritage Museum in Omaha. We are having a combined ETS/NBP wild blowout. We are planning a social hour at 6:30 with dinner at 7:30 and service awards after dinner. After that the dancing begins, and McGowan starts wearing funny hats.
Mike is inviting Danny and if it works out that you bring the plane up, we would probably ask Shelly, Rod, Phil, etc. to see if any of your or Danny's staff would like to join us also

    Bill.

I hope you are exercising reguarly given your chips, salsa, dip and beans.

Hello - how is your day going??  Just think  it's almost Friday!!!!!!  I'm so glad, I'm ready for the weekend.   Nothing exciting here today.  Just homework and a nap probably.   Tonight I'll be cooking and marinating in preparation for david and I's big  cookout tomorrow night.  I'm making fajitas, my famous 7-layer dip, and  spinach puffs.  Plus we'll have the normal ammenities like chips and salsa,  ranch dip, refried beans.  I'm excited - it should be fun.  Well, I'll  talk to you tonight sometime.  I love you and miss you  bunches!!!!!
Love,

I am having lunch today with El Paso's CEO for their international group (Byron Kelley).  The meeting was set up to discuss El Paso's public positions in Brazil and the problems Orlando was having with them.  I will add your concerns to the list of items to discuss and get back with you.
 
Stan

Hi Stan,
 
Given all of the other issues you are, undoubtedly, handling for Enron these days, I wonder if you could do us the big favor of talking to El Paso's chairman (Weiss, spelling?).  Attached you will find an outline of a strategy for a cooperation undertaking between El Paso's power asset in the Dominican Republic (called CEPP, approximately 67 MW of barge mounted diesel engines, also selling power to the CDE, the government owned utility which has had a terrible payment record) and SECLP.  
 
We have tried to work with El Paso's Latin America folks but there seems to be little or no interest in pushing forward an aggressive agenda; at least not with Enron.  If you could find some time just to mention these issues to him and let him know that we are very much interested in working with his team, that would be great.
 
Thank you very much.
 
Mariella
 

Mariella, I cannot get El Paso to comment on this proposal nor give a commitment to anything more than agreeing to work together.  They don't disagree with the concept attached or the fact that we may want to be shut down at the same time to cause the GoDR to address us seriously.  I can't tell if they are not ready to commit or they just want to keep their options open for a while.
 
I believe it would be good to give this to Stan and have him talk to his counterpart at El Paso, acknowledging that the groups are working together to achieve a common goal of realizing the stranded costs.  It might put some pressure on the indecision at the lower ranks.

I met with Byron Kelley who runs El Paso's international business.  He is an old business aquaintance that I had not visited with in several years.  Byron assured me that he would stop the type of press like the article you sent.  He reiterated although that El Paso has had good success in dealing with the government in a very private way and did not want to publicise any differences that they may have with the government from time to time.  He was willing to stop the press articles that defined differences between El Paso and Enron in their approach to Brazil but had no desire to join Enron in publically trying to effectuate change in Brazil.  The meeting was very friendly.  Let me know if I can be of further help.

Hope all is well with you and you and your family.

Yes

Does this look ok to you?

Cindy: 

Below is the e-mail to be sent to Phil Lowry's group and Danny McCarty's group announcing the floor meeting with Stan. The same memo will be sent to both groups, but changing the time and location. The message will be going out to these two groups tonight from Stan.

Thanks!

Kimberly

Please join me for an open discussion floor meeting on Wednesday, November 7, at (time) on the (location). 

This will be an opportunity for me to update you on what is currently happening within Enron, EGS and ETS, as well as an opportunity for me to answer any questions you have.

I look forward to seeing you there, and thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.

Stan

With everything that is going on it would be prudent to hold off pursing any acquisitions at this time.  Thanks.
 

Hi Stan/Jim,
 
I have a quick question to ask - perhaps it seems self-evident to you and if so, I apologize, but it's so sensitive that I prefer to have clear guidance on this.
 
With all that is going on with Enron (specifically the debt/liquidity related issues), I would like to know if our actions to pursue the best interest of the company in DR, Panama, Gaza and/or any country which has issues with either cash or debt, should be at all influenced by current events.  Jim, I have asked this question before (of Panama and DR) but things were never so delicate.  Pls. let me know.
Thanks, Mariella

I'm glad you had a good weekend.  I am taking DK out to dinner tonght so I won't be home.

Dad

Good morning.  Sorry I didn't get to talk to  you yesterday.  I wanted to see how your weekend went and tell you thank  you for Sea World on Saturday.  We had a blast there and at the concert  Friday.  What did you do this weekend?  What are you doing tonight for  Debbie's birthday?  Well, I'm off to philosophy for the last class in there  - YEA!!!!!  Accounting was cancelled for this morning so I got to sleep in  a little.  It was really nice.  Talk to you later.  I love  you!!!  Have a good week.
    Caron

CONGRATULATIONS>  Job well done.

Howdy!!!  How's your Friday going?   Mine's GREAT!!!!!  You wanna know why???
 
I MADE AN A ON MY STATS  TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
The class average was a sixty-something so I'm  really excited!!  Anyway, just thought I'd let ya know.  David and I  are having a huge cookout tonight so I'll give you a call before that or you can  give me a call on your way home from work.  I love you and will talk to you  later.
Love,
Caron

Congratulations.  

Thanks very much for the flowers, they are beautiful and will certainly brighten my week as I look at them.  It was a very big surprise and very thoughtful.  MaryKay

I hope somebody else draws my name then.

Thanks for the article. It was good to see and talk to you again, if you need
help scheduling a time in dec. for Orlando let me know if I can help. Good
luck with your decision making in the coming weeks and know that the quality
of your christmas gift depends on the amount of my enron losses. !!!!! But
don't allow that to interfere with right and wrong. Keep in touch when you
can.  Ken

Please call me tonight and five me an update.  Good luck on the mythology test.

Hello there.  How are you today?  I have  a test in mythology today and an accounting thing to go to tonight where I meet  some of the reps. from some of the companies Trinity deals with through our  internship program.  It's at 7:00pm so I'll give you a call afterwards and  tell you how it goes.  I hope you have a good day today and I'll talk to  you later.  I'll give you an update on how Rose is doing when I find out  from Mom or Jennifer.  I love you!!
Love,
Caron

Ask Julie to play with us.  I could play Sunday if that would be better.

I should be able to....(this is Steve)...however,   I will need to check
with Julie to make sure no plans have been set yet (i.e. kids
soccer..etc..).   I will fax over the tee time request to ensure we lock a
time.  Thanks.

Steve

The Wall Street has some good articles.  Read it every day this week.  Glad Rose and you are doing good.  Busy day for me.  Lots to do.  Call tonight.  

Love, Dad

Hi Daddy.  Well, I read yesterday's Wall  Street Journal but haven't gotten my hands on today's yet.  Those articles  were pretty interesting.  Are there any good ones today?  It's cool to  read the WSJ now compared to freshman year when we used it in economics because  now I really understand the terminology they use!!!  It's a cool  feeling.  Anyway, my day is going well.  I talked to Jennifer this  morning and she said Rose is doing well today and getting better so that's  good.  She was going to try and talk to the vet to see if he'd talked to  the toxicologist at A&M yet so if I hear anything about that I'll let you  know.  I get to register for classes Monday (YIKES!!!!) and have made up my  schedule.  It's all business classes I'm required to take but I'll go over  it with you tonight.  I love you and will call you this evening.  Have  a good day!!
Love,
Caron

We definately need to talk ASAP.  Please call Cindy or call me at home 281.320.1240.  With regard to 1) and 2) the answer for now is no for now.  Between Rod and Tod we will keep you covered.  You will have to work double load for a while longer with regard to Americas-GM.  The O&M makes sence.  Go ahead.  I will explain all this when I talk with you.

Following up on our lunch meeting in Houston, there are 3 positions which I want to fill, preferably by the end of the year:
	
	1.  CFO.  With Tod's part-time status as of Jan 1, we will need a CFO.  That person can sit either in Texas or California.  

	2.  Americas - GM. I want to fill the Americas VP/General Manager position.  This person will have overall P&L responsibility for our Americas business unit and will manage our US commercial, engineering, manufacturing and O&M activities.  This is a critical day-to-day operating position and I am certainly not giving it the needed attention.  This person needs to sit in California and spend a significant amount of his or her time in Tehachapi.  I really do not have an internal candidate whom I would be comfortable placing in this role and view this as an opportunity to further upgrade our senior management ranks.  I want to find a superstar to fill this role! 

	3.  Americas - O&M.  I need to add a senior O&M person in the US (a #2 who can mature into #1).  We are recruiting for this position externally, but if you know of any good candidates who might be interested, that would be great. 

 I will set up a time to talk with you about all three positions  - clearly, if there are qualified Enron candidates that are looking for a home/new challenge, I would be very interested.  Adam    

It looks good to me.

Stan,

As discussed at Monday's staff meeting, we intend to issue the attached (ANA Sale) news release tomorrow.  The closing is scheduled for 9:05 a.m. tomorrow and we intend to issue the release as soon as we have confirmation from the bank that funds have been deposited.

Jack Urquhart has inquired as to his continuing role for providing oversight of the Trojan decommissioning.  I think he sits on the review committee.  Please give your thoughts on this.  I think we need someone from Enron on the committee but given Jack's changing role he may or may not be the right person.  Please acknowledge receipt of this given our email difficulties.  Thanks

I think we should add to the letter "each year the Chairman of the Natural Gas Council has to privilege to name two individuals to the Council.  The experience you have gained as both a state and federal regulator coupled with experience working in the private sector makes you an excellent addition to this years Council."  A similarly worded phrase could be added to Rick's.Thanks

Have any comments?

Cindy please have Mr. Horton approve/change the attached letter.  This letter will also be sent to Rick Richard.  Later little one.

Calm down.  The operative word is it has been put on hold.  These are not normal times.  No one saw this coming or we could have planned better.  Give us a few days to figure everything out.  We just made the decision today to preserve cash while we were waiting to see what was going to happen.  Thanks for your cooperation which I desperately need right now.

I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons.

The Gas Logistics team was "relocated" off the 41st floor on October 5.  Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  

After the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.

Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.

I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.  Finding out  that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership.

Too bad about the Saporito's.  It's tough to see a family break apart.  It was nice that ours could stay together even if it is non-traditional.  You know how much I care about your Mom's happiness and welfare.

Too bad about your week coming up but considering the two weeks I have had you get no sympathy.  I will be here late tonight.

Love Dad..

GET THE WSJ EARLY TOMORROW!

Hey there.  How are you today?  I'm soooo  tired but okay otherwise.  I looked at my schedule for next week last night  only to realize next week is going to be the most horrible week EVER!!!!  I  have a Greek and Roman History test Monday, a stats test Wednesday, and both a  b. law test and an accounting test on Thursday.  Way too many tests in the  same week especially with two on the same day!!!!!!!!!  I'm sure I'll live  through it but next week won't be fun for sure.  
    By the way, I just thought I'd  let you know that Joe Saporito left Lynne and the girls and is getting a divorce  from Lynne.  Because of that Lynne, Lauren, and Rachel are going to come  have Thanksgiving with Mom and I.  I just thought you might want to know  that since I know you like the girls a lot.  
    Well, that's all the news I've  got.  I read the WSJ for yesterday and have today's but haven't read it  yet.  I am becoming very informed.  It's very interesting for  sure.  I love you and will call you tonight. 
Love,
Caron

I agree with your last sentence.  Thanks for helping us through this crunch time.

Fair enough.  I know you have much bigger issues to contend with right now.  We can be patient. 

In the long run, I feel like this issue needs to be addressed for us to return to the vision of trying to breakdown the operating company silos and run an integrated gas logistics group.

if all the mutual funds are selling off then whos buying up all the shares??
Takeover co's.? Seven dollars a share is unbelievable !!!! Talk to you later

Long term investors get rewarded.  Hang in there.  You haven't lost until you have sold.  Be careful not to let your losses turn into long-term losses.  Short-term losses are treated as ordinary income for tax purposes meaning Uncle Sam absorbs 40% of your losses!  Then buyback and hold for a few years.

They need more people like you running the co. Keep plugging away hard work
usually pays dividends.  Ken  ps I held on to the shares

Your thoughts.

Stan,

Given the recent developments related to the DPC project, I would like to
offer the help of my group in providing analytical support in evaluating different options
that are open to us.

One member of my group, Sandeep Kohli, worked for years for DPC
in Mumbai and has not only good understanding of all the related contracts,
but also excellent relationships with the major stakeholders, partners and regulatory authorities.
He has also excellent analytical skills. His recent project was related to evaluation
of the potential for developing power markets around Maharashtra, to improve
economic viability of the DPC project (Dec 2000 - February 2001) - a presentation
is attached.

Please, feel free to ask Jim Hughes about Sandeep's skills and dedication to the company.

I think this is a good summary of where we are:

1.  QF Status:  Mirant is willing to provide a legal opinion that it meets the QF status under the PPA if it is required to close.

2.  A market report should be issued by Mirant today as to the reasons they have only been able to secure $300 million instead of $500 million in insurance.  Hopefully this will satisfy the lenders.

3.  Mirant's proposal went out today on how to protect the lenders if the SHO is extinguished.

4.  Mirant and GE have agreed to a closing checklist and fee coverage.

Things left to do:

1Finalize all documents

2.  Receive underwriter approval on the resolution of all insurance claims.

3.Agree upon mirror guarantees with Enron and Mission relating to the Union Carbide guarantees.

Jeff Donahue informs me that CFSB feels secure that this deal will close on December 15 but not before.  The reason is that there are PPA bids that need to go out by that date.

Let's keep daily status reports coming. If I have misrepresented anything in the summary, please let me know.

I'll be fine.  Thanks for thinking of me.  I am more worried about the 13,000 people that work for me. Tough time bro'!  I noticed yesterday that my hands were staring to tremble a bit.  I think I need some time off when this is over..not too much time though.
  

   Do you know yet how the merger or sale would effect you and what your
doing now. It sure doesn't sound very good foe alot of the officers or ex
officers these days. I know your busy take care  Ken

How much did I give Dennis last year?

I realize it's been a tough year and at the very least, these are trying times.  However, I ask that you consider a donation to support Texas Special Olympics.  On November 17, Enron bowlers will participate in the third annual bowl-a-thon to support this worthwhile organization.   

Texas Special Olympics is a year-round sports training and competition program, patterned after the Olympic Games, which gives people with mental retardation the chance to strengthen their character, develop their physical skills, display their talents , and fulfill their human potential.  

Special Olympics believes that through sports training and competition, people with mental retardation are benefited physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually; families are strengthened; and the community at large, both through participation and observation, is united with mentally retarded people in an environment of equality, respect, and acceptance.

All money raised from this event will be used to provide financial support to assist the Special Olympics programs located in the Southern and Southeastern regions of Texas.

Once again, please consider a donation.

Thank you in advance for your generosity.

Thanks.  Steve has been a valuable asset for Enron and ETS which is exactly why other Enron business units are so interested in his services.  I made sure that Steve knew that he could stay with ETS.  The decision was his.  However, we must always remember that sometimes we need do what is in the best interest of Enron and not just ourselves.  Thank you for letting me know your feelings.
Stan,

I can only imagine how full your plate is.  Thanks for your visits on the different floors to communicate with ETS personnel.

In these trying times at Enron, everyone is looking to strong, honest leadership to get us throuh this.  Please consider having Steve Hotte remain on board as ETS' CIO for the time being.  He is truly the single, best person I've ever worked for and believe his leadership is much more valuable in ETS than in another area of Enron right now.  

At least ensure Steve has the choice to remain at ETS or move on.  Should he decide to move on, I would respect that and support anyone you name as his replacement.

My "inner voice" told me to send you this message.

Thanks,
Scott Abshire
Director, ETS Infrastructure

We will miss you also.  Glad we had you for the time we did.  See you at th=

As you guys probably know, I will be officially retired on January 1, 2002;=
 therefore, the meeting on November 12th will be my last and a good time to=
 elect my successor.  Thanks for letting me continue as your corporate secr=
etary after stepping down from that position at Enron.  I don't think I cou=
ld have let go "cold turkey," and I loved EOTT because of my fondness for t=
he directors and most of the management.  (I'll reserve comments on some me=
mbers of management who are no longer with us.)  I have really enjoyed it s=
ince Stan-the-Man got involved, and the morale and operating results show h=
ow positive that was for the company.  I have also been a long time admirer=
 of Good-Golly-Miss-Molly and loved working with Walt Zimmerman.  So, it is=
 my hope and sincere recommendation that Walt be selected to succeed me.  H=
e has demonstrated repeatedly that he is capable of doing the job -- in fac=
t, he has been doing the job for a long time, all except the actual taking =
of the minutes, and he has relieved me of that duty on more than one occasi=
on.  He's a person of integrity, loyalty, and dedication, and I know the Di=
rectors like him.  I hope you two agree.

I'll miss you guys, and Mollie, I'd love to have lunch with you and Walt an=
ytime.  I'll also be available for any help and advice that I can give.

Thanks again.

Much love, Peggy Sue

I will be there unless I have to work.  For now I am ok.

Tee time is at 11:37 on the new.  Steve was a little negligent on sending the request in, sorry.  Hope this time is ok.  Let me know.

Tom

Thanks.  I made it clear to Steve that he could have stayed.  Steve made the decision that was in his and the company's best interest.  He has not contacted me about staying.  

I know you are getting a lot of emails right now.  I will keep this short.  Directors under Steve Hotte believe with what is going on with Enron it would make good business since to keep Steve as our leader in ETS-IT.  

ETS-IT staff working very hard to make our goals and objectives for the year, but there is this outside pressure with all of the changes coming down the pipe.  I think we need to keep our strong leadership in tact until we weather the storm.

Thanks for having time to read this...

Thanks Mike.  That means alot.

Stan - Thank you for taking the time to brief the employees in Omaha today.  Needless to say, these are trying times and you are correct when you say that communications are very important!  All of us have to provide leadership and set the example for the employees.  We really appreciate your leadership and commitment to the employees!!!  It really does mean a lot to the employees.

Thank You very much.

Mike McGowan

Thanks.  I have heard from just about all of Steve's reports about retainin=

 was in his and Enron's best interest.  Steve is a quality individual and a=
n exceptional leader.  His talents need to be showcased and I think he unde=
rstood that.  I appreciate your comments on Steve's replacement.  We have f=

the kind words.

Stan

Stan,
I know that you are overloaded with all the company issues, but I just want=
ed to relay a few thoughts.  First of all, thank you for the words of encou=
ragement and confidence at your floor meeting.  This is a very difficult ti=
me for all of us, but you especially have a big burden.  Your openness, hon=
esty and confidence was very reassuring.  Other thoughts on my mind are jus=
t concerns about Steve Hotte leaving the organization given all the other c=
hanges.  Would it be possible for you to ask Steve to stay given the curren=
t situation?  I would think he would be very concerned about his change mov=
ing into ENA right now.  He might reconsider a move if you discuss it with =
him.  Finally, if it is best for him to move on, I feel it is extremely imp=
ortant to have someone in that job that understands our business.  I think =
Steve's business knowledge and ability to work closely with the Commercial =
group is what has made him so effective.  The Technology group's greatest c=
hallenge is never technology itself, but rather understanding the business =
so that technology can be appropriately applied.  I am aware that Brad Holm=
es is on the short list and just want to say that I have been very impresse=
d with him.  He has very good knowledge of our business and has good techni=
cal savvy.  He has developed a very good working relationship with the IT o=
rganization and I have enjoyed working with him.  I would feel very good wi=
th him in that position if we have to loose Steve.  I understand there are =
several other candidates to consider and that this will be a difficult deci=
sion.  I will certainly support and respect whatever decision you make.  Th=
anks for listening and I'll keep you in my prayers for strength as we work =
through the toughest days that we have ever faced as Enron employees. 

Looks like I need to cancel.  My wife reminded me that I promised to take my daughter to lunch on Saturday. She hasn't been home in a month and I would like to see her.   Can you play on Sunday morning?  If so I will try and get a t time.  Let me know.  Thanks.

No Problem.  Give me a call on my cell if you can't make it 281-798-7317.

Tammie Schoppe on behalf of John Lavorato.

We are on for lumch.  The guys wanted to play golf Saturday at 11:30 but I told them I had lunch with you and couldn't make it.

Hi Daddy!!!!!  I haven't gotten my WSJ today,  but I will or you can bring yours home for me to read if you want to.   :)  I can't wait to come home today.  I miss you bunches!!  I  haven't seen you in too long a time.  Are we still on for lunch  Saturday??  I hope so!!  Anyway, I'm not sure when I'll get home  today.  My last class gets out at 2:30, but David has an appointment at the  urologist at 3:00 so we can't leave till that's over so I'm not real sure when  we'll get out of here.  I know we're leaving right after that to come  home.  I'll give you a call tonight sometime though.  I love you and  will see you soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Love,
caron

OK but you need to fill out the form and get it to Cindy.  If you need help call Cindy.  She can schedule the plane for you and probabley take care of the paper work.

Stan,
Per our earlier discussion, this is a request for permission to use of the company's plane so that Jim and I can attend the ceremony below, which will be used to sign an agreement with the utility, pursuant to which they will acquire the Subic and Butangas power assets.  Our team, lead by Steve Jernigan, will work around the clock between now and that date to paper the transaction.  The documentation will still be subject to board approval.  If things go as planned, we could be talking about proceeds in the range of $100 to $110 million at a purchase price that is in excess of 30% higher than our own fair market valuation for the asset.  Earnings results will depend on tax' position vis a vis the booking of deferred US taxes on the transaction.

Thanks, Mariella

Dear Steve,

The Energy Investors' Forum in New York City appears to be a "by invitation only" affair hosted by CSFB on Nov. 15 and by Citibank on Nov. 16.

Highlights of Nov. 15
Investors' Forum with Philippine DOE Secretary Vince Perez speaking at 3:30 pm in Norse Suite, 18th Floor, Waldorf Astoria
Signing of MOU's (3 to 4 inclusive of the two agreements with Enron) at 5:10 to 5:20 pm--Ed Delfonso (President of PSALM) and Vince Perez (DOE Secretary and also Vice Chair of NPC) are expected to be the signatories on the agreements with Enron; President Arroyo is likely to be in attendance

Highlight of Nov. 16
Investors' lunch hosted by Citibank probably also in Waldorf Astoria but not yet confirmed

While we are still unsure whether or not we will have the agreements ironed out by Monday/Tuesday next week, the Philippine DOE has requested that we submit the names of Enron individuals that should be invited to the events.  We need to have this list immediately, which I will discuss with you shortly.

Best regards,
Manuel

I would like you to get directly involved in selling the assets we have targeted for next year while overseeing the operations of Mariella, Pete and Orlando.  That is alot of stuff.  However I will keep you in mind as we figure out who is going to be on the transition team.

Stan:

Assuming we limit our India involvement to an offshore legal strategy, I will need more to do.  If you are asked to contribute a resource to transition, I am probably going to have excess time available.

Jim

I will call him again on Monday.  Do I get a commission.  Just kidding.

Stan

I haven't heard from the fellow from El Paso

I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS.  PLEASE CALL TOMORROW IF POSSIBLE.  I THINK WE SHOULD PUT A NUMBER ON THE TABLE.

STAN

Supposedly but I am trying to get out of it.  I will let you know.

Are you still going to be making a presentation?

Stan,

A quick update-

I expect to sign and return the ANNGTC MOU tomorrow.
A contingent of the current and rejoining partners will meet with Senators in DC on Thursday.  Joe Hartsoe will represent us.
Following meetings with Senators, a joint press release will be issued announcing the MOU.  Gina Taylor and John Ambler are vetting the release/Q+A's; Gina will be the media contact.

I'll forward a complete package for your files when finalized.

We will discuss at the next Staff meeting.  Thanks for bringing it up.  Any=
 feedback from the floor meeting yesterday would be appreciated.

Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus=
 difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaz=
a.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the pos=
ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa=
red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has be=
en the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floati=
ng of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cas=
h crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully gu=
aranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, B=
LM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would c=
ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th=
e GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from acti=
ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with pri=
vate parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which=
 although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a "mark" on th=
e company's liquidity position. =20

Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panam=
a or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made=
) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro=
n to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The sa=
me could go for SECLP and Gaza.

This is simply an overall "guidance" question.  Let's take it up during our=
 staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Many thanks, Mariella

As I said yesterday it is my understanding that we need Dynegy's permission in order to engage in such discussions.  I however have not seen the final merger documents so I may be mistaken.  Given Dynegy's presentation to the analysts on Monday it doesn't look like the want to divest of the pipes.  This is Greg's call.

Greg, Jeff and Stan:

I just received a call from David Dehaemers at Kinder, Morgan.  They are interested in buying Transwestern and offered to have Rich call Ken - but I waived that off in order to get a read from you all.

With respect to the merits, if a preferred at the pipe level is being treated as effectively debt by the rating agencies, a sale is roughly equivalent to a preferred with respect to both ratings and liquidity.  In addition, the sale should provide greater proceeds due to lower cost of funds and may have a higher probability of success.  One key issue will be funding the sale at signing or HSR rather than regulatory approval.

I first wanted to test you three, and if supportive, determine the best path upon which to proceed including gaining Dynegy's consent.

Jeff

Wahoo!!  go big red.  If we don't beat Miami, the BCS will never hear the end of it (they may not anyway but who cares).  Watch party at the Hyatt House on 1/3, you guys and spouses are invited.  Let me know if you can make it (yes, other Aggies will likely be attending).

 I verified the numbers with Ron, he did make the addition error.  I also added the line for 
the Red Hawk lateral as a separate item.  James had already run the economics using $843mm plus a 5% risk adjustment adder for the Capex for a total of $885mm.  I think we have enough pad in this thing to take care of the error.

life is good, work sucks.  Things are a little tough, we judge the day by how many news trucks are parked outside.

Oh the depths we sunk to.....

Kevin, 

   Always glad to hear from you!

   The last e-mail was funny.

   I hope all is going well for you.

thanks!!!!!!!!!!!1

Kevin, I did your time today since I will be out until Tuesday of next week.  What I did was go ahead and put you away on Friday (I can always go back in and change that when I return if you decide you can't take that day).  The important aspect to tell you about this is that I didn't put it as Vacation, rather as your Discretionary Holiday.  If worse comes....you will be compensated for untaken vacation days but not for that discretionary day.  So...................

is 2pm OK?

Could you give me some time on your calendar today, say about 1 or 1:30 for 101 training and some insights on setting up this excell sheet?

 When you get the pages filled in for "supply", "Plants", and "pipeline", let's review to see how we want the summary to look.

Hope you're enjoying the parent visit!  Thanks for the VD card, that was cute.  If Jesse Jackson shows up here one more time, we're getting a group together and going downstairs to moon him.

602-250-2799, I don't have an email for him.

Kevin,

Do you have Tom Carlton's contact details?

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.

Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)

Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.
 

Per our conversation today, when you folks get a chance, I need someone to verify the current pressure of the Gomez lateral and do a linepack calculation for me.  We are evaluating a potential sale of the lateral and need to know how much sweet gas is in the system.  Please let me know if an answer by Friday 2/22 is not possible.

thanks for the help

how many fingers am I holding up??    Glad to hear it went well.  Have a nice long weekend!!!!!!!!!1

vision is pretty blurry, but will clear up a little bit every day.  I can't see through my glasses anymore because they have a correction.  He wants me to wait at least 6 weeks before deciding the strength of any correction.  I have to see him again in a couple of weeks.  I  can actually see better in the right eye than I could in the left after they did that one, but we did the worst one first, so that is probably why.  Anyway, all is well.  I'm staying in today but hope to get out some tomorrow and Sunday and Monday, of course. 
 
Hope you both have a wonderful weekend.

Dennis--

I'm checking that out now.  Western Gas, Sid Richardson, and Duke have all looked at it before.

I'm out of town on Wednesday.  I'd like to see the economics and risks outlined before this getting too far down the road with Pioneer.  Are there any other prospective buyers?

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects. 

Sun Devil Marketing

--  Met with Panda Energy and Tampa Electric officials and discussed the latest transport proposal.  The pricing and term were well received.  We have forwarded to Panda an outline of the credit terms TW will need as well as supply contacts and points available to them in the San Juan basin.  We are also evaluating a reverse-tilt transport offer to provide them with a lower rate in the early years, but the rate may not be enough to provide adequate coverage ratios for the pipeline project.

--	Arizona Public Service - APS responded this week to our latest offer.  Their concerns were (1) TW credit in the face of the current Enron bankruptcy, and (2) our volume offer of 200,000/day in light of the current El Paso full requirements debate.  As for credit, we forwarded to APS the current update on TW's efforts with the various rating agencies and our timeline for getting a new rating established.  For volume, APS may be willing to sign up for less volume and forgo the "out" clause, but this puts more of the early development risk on TW for capital required to file the FERC application.

--	Project Engineering - with Doug Cebryk's resignation, the Sun Devil project has been forwarded to Arnold Eisenstein.

I wanted to be sure you saw this.

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects. 

I found these numbers in a file, Loc Code 14039, 14225, 24008

I'm not sure what assets they are in reference to.

FYI.

Judy,

I need to provide a NBV for a Gomez Laterial (35miles of 20" pipe), to Kevin Hyatt. Frank says it should be in company 0060 (TW).
I ran the following locations numbers: 44*094, 44*095, 44*149 44*34037, but found nothing in co. 0060.  Can you help?

Thanks,

Mary

Guys,
	is there a way you can tell me what the MMBtu content of the gas is coming into TW from NorthWest Pipeline, TransColorado, and then what it is at Gallup?

I'm looking for historical info for say the last 6 months.

thanks
kh

the network may be in here shortly to interview me (Claire Shipman?)  Did the parents make it out of town OK?

Here's the info for Gaye Lynn Schaffart (woman)

Kevin,

How are you doing? I hope you & your family are doing
well. I was wondering if I should contact Gale Schfart
at Northern Borders regarding the analyst position you
mentioned in the previous e-mail. If I should, do you
have his contact number?
Thanks a lot, and keep in touch

we will cancel these weekly meetings until we get some marketing contracts signed.  Any updates will be taken care of via weekly reports or in Steve Harris' weekly staff meeting.

By now you've probably heard that Kinder-Morgan shelved their Sonoran project.

Susan, please cancel any conf room reservation.

James, can you please run 2 cases to calculate a backhaul rate to Phoenix using Sun Devil?

case 1: Using the Capex of $290,181,156 (which includes the Red Hawk lateral), what does the rate need to be using 100% load factors for 20 years with the terminal value and our hurdle return rate of 15%?  Assume fuel at 0% for the entire term (source of gas would likely be Cal border area storage facilities).

case 2: same as above but load factors as follows:

year 1-2		50%
year 3-4		70
year 5-7		85
year 8-20	100%

We are trying to respond to Panda Energy by Friday 2/22.

yes the 750 case, sorry I left that out.

yours truly just got interviewed by the Office of the US Trustee to see if I wanted to serve on the Creditors Committee representing the ex- and current employee group.  I find out later if I made the cut.

Bill, I need a confidentiality agrmt for a proposed pipe sale transaction.

We are evaluating possibly selling a lateral piece of TW pipe to Pioneer.  They are interested in purchasing approx. 35 miles of pipe that TW took out of service in 2000.  The pipe in located in Ward and Pecos County, Texas.  

Once the C.A. is executed, we would let Pioneer begin due diligence covering information such as easements, maintenance records, physical location, etc.

Pioneer is an owner/operator of gas gathering & intrastate pipe transmission assets.  Their info is as follows:

Pioneer Gas Pipeline, Inc.
Mr. Philip R. Allard, President

let me know if you need any further info.

I saw this too.  Is this just more stumping by "concerned" politicians in a congressional election year ( I can't remember what party Brady is with).  Is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an "open mic" bitch session.  I'd pass and read the results in the paper (media is invited) or the web site.

Should I go to this meeting? 

Jean,
	I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an "image builder" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.

Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).

So my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?

thanks,

Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.

Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.  

Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.  I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.

If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.

kh

I'm out of town on Wednesday.  I'd like to see the economics and risks outlined before this getting too far down the road with Pioneer.  Are there any other prospective buyers?

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.

Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)

Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.
 

got it

Kevin-

Quick thought - - - 

We need to add a "pressure guarantee" as a condition of service.  This has been discussed with both PW and Panda and needs to be explicit in the term sheet.

only 2,687 mcf, this is per the field guys last week when they did the pressure check.

How much sweet gas is in the line?

Roger, see note below.  Can you please have someone start pulling the ROW files for this pipe?  Once they're available, I'd like to review them before we open them up to Pioneer.  

thanks for the help.

Dear Team--

	We are evaluating the potential sale of TW's existing 20-inch diameter Gomez lateral in Pecos and Ward County, Texas and have executed a confidentiality agreement with the proposed buyer (Pioneer Gas Pipeline).  The buyer would like to begin the due diligence process as early as possible and has asked to review  info related to the following:

	1) Maintenance records for last 3 years
	2) right-of-way / easement agreements

The potential benefits to TW of this transaction include 1) monetizing an asset that today is generating zero value and 2) creating a new source of gas supply into TW from the buyer.

Questions I have are:

	a) Can we designate a "point" person from the Monahans Team that I can coordinate with and who would that be?
	b) Where / who has the records & documents for the items above?

Your timely response is greatly appreciated.  Please coordinate with me all questions / concerns.  I ask that no information (verbal or written) be passed to any interested outside party without prior clearance with me.   

thanks for your help!!  I can be reached in Houston at 713-853-5559.

I'll also need copies of your receipts for the Treasurer.  thx.

Kevin,

You owe me $255.90 for the 3 children that I shopped for.

If you want you can bring me the labels and pick up the bags.

 I am still slated to be the panel chairperson for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee at the Electric Power Conference in St. Louis March 19-21, 2002.  As chairperson, my conference registration is free ($525 value), I only have to pay air/hotel/meals.  

Is it still OK to attend this conference?

I will be there.

thanks,

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

i agree, let's keep the BaseDat too.

Well, this sounds very important.  What do you think?

Base Case is the unit level detail on all the power plants in the US. Heat rates, loads, generation, co2, nox ...
 
Very Critical.

What exactly is BaseDat?

Susan, Which application? Kevin presently has access to all 4

Okay, I've got authorization for 1 user application.  Please list it in the name of Kevin Hyatt and it should be billed against 0366/112458.  Thanks very much, Paula.

Susan -
 
The cost (pending) is $500.00 per user per application and could be higher pending the response from all the users.
 
Paula -

Paula, I was not listed on your memo re RDI and I have had access since June.  Kevin Hyatt and I work together using this software and in deciding whether to get 1 or 2 accesses, we need to know the price.  Could you let me know that so I can approach our VP about this.
 
Hope all is going great for you.

. . . unless you can address with OBAs . . . 

Looks like we've got a problem with hourly deliveries at 1/16th of MDQ.

Eric, here are my thoughts on your Sun Devil issues.

I assume that a guarantee will not include Liquidated Damages, if it does we would want to rethink the response.  However,

?	Current Sun Devil facility design and cost estimates are based upon a 24hr MDQ to match with existing TW Mainline services.
?	Additional facilities will be required to accommodate 24hr ratable nominations at shipper receipt points.
?	Minimum delivery pressures of 500-600 psi should not be an issue for current Sun Devil scope (at 24hr MDQ).  We will run transient modeling to confirm.
?	If requested, we can re-design and re-estimate Sun Devil at a 16hr MDQ, 24hr ratable noms at receipt points and minimum delivery pressure obligations (with Liquidated Damages or not), but it will be enormously more expensive than the current proposed Sun Devil project.
?	Notwithstanding the engineering required to provide these types of services, there may be issues with existing certificates, tariffs, customers etc. due to the fact that Sun Devil gas will run in the same pipeline facilities along with existing Transwestern services.  But I'm not much of an authority in that area.
?	If you would like us to proceed with the re-design and re-estimate please advise John Keller and he will start the paperwork.

Phil,

I wanted to get your thoughts on service conditions that we're discussing with prospective Sun Devil shippers.

Hourly swings.  We've indicated that the shippers can nominate 1/16th of their MaxDQ at delivery points in any hour subject to-
- Proper notice
- 24 hour ratable nominations at receipt points
- no obligation on the pipeline to deliver more than the MaxDQ in any gas day

Pressure guarantee.  All prospective shippers are power generators and they want pressure guarantees in the range of 500-600 psig.

Paul, thanks for your email.  

We are working hard to get the Sun Devil project ready for FERC filing, likely by Sept 2002.  If you would like to send a qualification package, please remit to my project engineer at:

I am a project manager with Harris Group in Denver.  We specialize in the
design of compressor stations and have considerable experience in the
western U.S.  I was hoping to get an update from you on the Sun Devil
Expansion project.  Have you applied with FERC?  Is there any opportunity
for our company to submit a proposal for the project?  Would you like to see
a Qualification Package that expands on our experience?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

we are still on target to file the FERC app in September.  Are you planning to attend the Aquila Storage meeting this morning?

Kevin, thanks.  What's the latest on Sun Devil?  Does it make sense for us to visit again?

Sun Devil Project

	El Paso Full Requirements contracts - this debate was stricken from FERC's agenda again this week (for the 3rd time) indicating dissent among Commissioners on how best to settle the allocation of El Paso's system serving Arizona and California markets.  We may see a draft allocation order circulated prior to the next FERC meeting on 3/14.

	Az Public Service - Conference call was held 2/28 to discuss the latest proposal.  APS remains hesitant to make any project commitment until they have a clearer direction from FERC on their EP full requirements contract.  APS is forwarding to TW their likely operating scenarios for the 2000 Mw Red Hawk plant so we can draft an SFV rate design.

	The Arizona Corporation Commission granted permit approval this week to a new 1000 Mw gas-fired power plant in southeast Arizona.  The new Bowie plant sits on the El Paso south system and is slated to be on-line in 2004.  The new plant will only add to the capacity pressure on El Paso.

	Panda Energy - credit discussions were held outlining the provisions ETS would like to see from Panda to support a transport agreement.  Panda is forwarding to us the cash waterfall language from their debt agreements that puts the fuel supply (including transport) and electric transmission payments ahead of all others (including bondholders).

pls forward eticket for Kevin Hyatt to ECN 1334.

COMMISSION APPROVES BOWIE POWER PROJECT  Requires Use of Solor Technology &=
 Groundwater Monitoring Program=09
PHOENIX - In a decision yesterday, the Arizona Corporation Commission appro=
ved the Bowie Power Station proposed for eastern Cochise County in southeas=
tern Arizona. The project, to be constructed in two 500-megawatt phases, is=
 a water-cooled power plant using a maximum of 6,000 acre-feet of groundwat=
er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output. Sout=
hWestern Power Group II is the project developer. The approval requires Sou=
thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p=
ower block. This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco=
rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project. Merchant powe=
r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu=
ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers. D=
uring Tuesday's meeting, the Commission accepted the 22 restrictions placed=
 on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com=
mittee. After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox=
 communities, the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission=
er Spitzer. The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby=
 pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa=
ter table. Summary of the Spitzer Amendment: The amendment requires SouthWe=
stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog=
ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria. Once the pro=
ject is operating, the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual =
contributions of $100,000 to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the=
 fund reaches a balance of $500,000. Any business or individual who can pro=
ve, through successful arbitration, that groundwater pumping has caused pro=
perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement. =
SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of $500,000 in th=
e fund. Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi=
e, the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S=
upervisors. The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t=
hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned. Commissi=
oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti=
ng impact of the power project. "I proposed this amendment to answer the co=
ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district," Commissioner =
Marc Spitzer said. "Although we heard testimony that the power plant's grou=
ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed, I don't think you=
 can be too careful. We're making decisions that could affect an economical=
ly depressed area for generations to come." Other Environmental Conditions:=
 Twenty-two conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis=
sion Line Siting Committee. They include: ? Establishment of a monitoring p=
roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori=
ng. Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping. Cracks, f=
issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep=
 underground that provided physical support is no longer there. ? Contribut=
ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg=
ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou=
s materials training for firefighters. ? Making arrangements with local law=
 enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv=
e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses=
 by local law enforcement. This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner =
Jim Irvin. ? Prior to construction of the facility, SouthWestern must provi=
de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi=
on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of=
 its output on reliable operation of the electric grid. ? Conditions requir=
ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona =
Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res=
ources. Additionally, the applicant will have to participate in and comply =
with all standards for safe, reliable power delivery. "I was pleased to sup=
port this project, in part because it includes solar technology as a key co=
mponent of the whole project. The level of support from the local community=
 was also impressive. Les Thompson, Chairman of the Cochise County Board of=
 Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A=
rizona community," Chairman Bill Mundell explained. "The residents and busi=
ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi=
ts of having the power plant in their community. Additionally, the project =
will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and, ulti=
mately, the 30 or 40 people needed to run the plant." Commissioner Irvin vo=
ted in favor of the project, saying: "I do believe the need for this projec=
t was established in the record. Further, I believe the project is in the p=
ublic interest and meets the balancing test." He was referring to the sitin=
g statute that requires the Commission "to balance, in the broad public int=
erest, the need for an adequate, economical and reliable supply of electric=
 power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an=
d ecology of this state." (Arizona Revised Statutes ? 40-360.07, subsection=

Roger, see note below.  Can you please have someone start pulling the ROW files for this pipe?  Once they're available, I'd like to review them before we open them up to Pioneer.  

thanks for the help.

Dear Team--

	We are evaluating the potential sale of TW's existing 20-inch diameter Gomez lateral in Pecos and Ward County, Texas and have executed a confidentiality agreement with the proposed buyer (Pioneer Gas Pipeline).  The buyer would like to begin the due diligence process as early as possible and has asked to review  info related to the following:

	1) Maintenance records for last 3 years
	2) right-of-way / easement agreements

The potential benefits to TW of this transaction include 1) monetizing an asset that today is generating zero value and 2) creating a new source of gas supply into TW from the buyer.

Questions I have are:

	a) Can we designate a "point" person from the Monahans Team that I can coordinate with and who would that be?
	b) Where / who has the records & documents for the items above?

Your timely response is greatly appreciated.  Please coordinate with me all questions / concerns.  I ask that no information (verbal or written) be passed to any interested outside party without prior clearance with me.   

thanks for your help!!  I can be reached in Houston at 713-853-5559.

You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market

Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila

Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.

you inner loop people lead such the lifestyle.  I'll take a rain check and plan on taking you to lunch later this week.  Let me know what day is good-- and we're taking your new truck!!!!
 

Celebrate 45 years?  Drown my sorrows is more like it!!!
 
The Last Concert Cafe is in the far northeast section of downtown in the warehouse district just south of I-10.  They have decent Tex-Mex if you want to grab a bite earlier.  Carolyn Wonderland is a young singer/songwriter who singing style is kind of a cross between Marcia Ball and Janice Joplin.  Expect an eclectic crowd and dress warm if it is cool that evening, it's a semi-outdoor event.
 
The Old Man

Tomorrow is Rick's 45th Birthday and to celebrate, we are going to the Last Concert Cafe at 1403 Nance Street and listen to Carolyn Wonderland.  I think the show starts about 10:00 p.m., so if any of you night owls are looking for somewhere to go tomorrow night, please come join us!

	per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.  A couple of current changes are:

Volume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d
Volume to Cal Border     -  30,000
San Juan receipts		 - 780,000

Projected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu

We are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24)
and pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).

Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.

Hi Jim-

	I hope your conversation with Paul Cherry went well last week.  Paul indicated to me that you might be sending a Conf Agrmt for us to execute so you could then pass along to us some of the debt covenant waterfall language.  I'll be happy to push that agreement thru the channels here once you send it.  If you feel it might be faster for us to send you our standard form agreement, let me know.

Also, along those same confidential lines, if you can provide to me some various operating scenarios for the plant (high, low, and base case operating assumptions) I can begin designing an SFV rate for you to look at.  Let me know please.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt

got your resume and I have forwarded it on to a contact at Duke.  Are you going to the job fair today at Enron Field?

Kevin,
  Attached is my resume for you to review. Let me know
what you think. I'll call you on Friday to see how it
goes. Thanks a lot, and it's been great working with
you. Good luck w/ Sun Devil.
  Take care, and keep in touch

http://www.journalstar.com/nebraska?story_id=5830&past= 
Brace yourselves, Nebraska football fans. The Huskers will feature a different look this coming season. 
No, Nebraska isn't switching to a pass-oriented attack. 
The Huskers, however, are in the midst of a significant change in uniform style. 
Although the details have yet to be finalized, the planned modifications will be the most extreme in several years. 
"It'll be the most significant change since I've been here," said Nebraska assistant equipment manager Mike Mason, who has been with the Huskers since 1988. 
Said Nebraska Coach Frank Solich: "There are certainly some noticeable changes, but the players seem to like the idea. And if you look around at pro and college teams, you see some changes." 
In Nebraska's case, Mason said, the most significant modifications will be in its road uniforms. The Huskers will wear white jerseys with a red strip around the collar and a red spandex insert - or gusset - down the sides. 
Mason said adidas - which has had a partnership with Nebraska to provide the Huskers with uniforms, shoes, etc., since the mid-1990s - would prefer the Huskers wear white pants with a 4-inch red stripe down the sides for both home and away contests (NU typically wears white pants with red jerseys at home and red pants with white jerseys on the road). But several players, Mason said, have expressed interest in wearing red pants with red jerseys for home games. 
"This isn't over yet," Mason said of the decision-making process. 
Some Nebraska fans may wince at the thought of a red-on-red combination. 
The last time the Huskers trotted onto the field at Memorial Stadium with that color scheme was in November 1986 for a game against nemesis Oklahoma. NU lost 20-17. 
The new home jerseys would be red with white piping down both sides of the red spandex insert. 
Solich said any remaining changes will probably be minor and will be subject to a vote of the team's Unity Council, made up of representatives from each position. 
Examples of the new uniforms are hanging in Nebraska's equipment room near the Husker locker room at Memorial Stadium. Because they're not the final versions, Solich requested they not be photographed. 
Solich said adidas representatives approached Husker officials in December about possible alterations, as is the case most every year. Although Solich discussed the changes with his assistant coaches, he mostly left the style decisions to the players, he said. 
"It'll certainly be different, but the colors will still be red and white - there will be no third color - and there will be no change whatsoever in the helmets," said Solich, who last season guided Nebraska to an 11-2 record in his fourth season as head coach. "Some things we just won't mess with." 
Pat Logsdon, Nebraska's director of football operations, likes the new uniforms. "I think they're nice-looking, and the guys love them," she said. 
Mason, though, was less enthusiastic. 
"I'm not sure the fans will like it," he said. "I don't necessarily like it." 
Added Solich, "Some fans don't ever want any change. Some do." 
The planned changes might come as a surprise to some fans, considering the importance Nebraska typically places on tradition. The new uniforms would be a departure from the simplicity in dress exhibited by such storied programs as Penn State, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Alabama, to name a few. 
"I think the uniforms we had were fine," Solich said. "I think our coaches felt that way, too. But you always want to be open to change, especially if the players feel like they'd like to make a change - as long as it doesn't totally back away from Nebraska's tradition."

Eric, here's an abbreviated rate model James put together for us.

 

Cancel me for the pm session on 3/7 as I now have another conflict.
thanks
Kevin Hyatt

pls cancel me for the 3/7 morning session.
thx

A new updated version.....

KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: To get to the other side.

PLATO: For the greater good.

ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.

KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

DR. TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would let
it take.

SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion. We were justified
in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN: I forgot.

HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.

ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a
threatening dominant market position. The chicken was faced with
significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for
the newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering
relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical
distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry
Integration Model(PIM),
Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge,
capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and
technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management
framework.

Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and
best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the
transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in
order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit,
and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the
implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing
an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry
cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting,
enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically
based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unified
market message and aligned with the chicken's mission,vision, and core
values.  This was conducive towards the creation of a total business
integration solution. In summary, Andersen Consulting helped the chicken
manage change to become more successful.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The chicken
crossed the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.

DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be
free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.

MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken,
"Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there
was much rejoicing.

FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own Eyes. How many more
chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?

RICHARD NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did
NOT cross the road.

MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why?
The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.

JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone
ever think to ask, "What the heck was this chicken doing walking around
all over the place, anyway?"

SIGMUND FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken
crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES: I will soon release the new Chicken Office 2002, which will not
only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and
balance your checkbook.

OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the road?
"Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we
overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"

CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally
selected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now genetically
endowed with the capabilities required to cross roads.

ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved
beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.

COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one.

BILL CLINTON : I did not, repeat, did not have sexual relations with the
chicken.

sorry, I was thinking bi-directional and wrote unilateral.  The CA with Panda should be bi-lateral.

Bill,
	Attached is a Conf Agrmt from Panda Energy.  They have requested we sign this so they can send TW confidential info related to the financing and cash waterfall covenants of their debt for the power plants.  I have not reviewed this yet, but I would like to make the agreement unilateral if it's not already.  Can we discuss this afternoon?

thanks

outstanding, thanks!!!

Kevin,

	Here's the Panda confidentiality agreement, which I've red-lined to reflect a couple of comments that I have. The agreement is bilateral, so that any confidential information provided by TW to Panda would also be covered.

Kevin,
 
Thanks again for the contacts.  You are a good friend.
 
Do you happen to have Gaylyn Safford's (sp?) phone number?
 
Take care.

Dear Phil,
	Hope you received the easement and line maps OK.  We are pulling the maintenance records together and should have this done by 3/15.  How does your calendar look for Friday 3/22 to meet at the Monahans office or early the week of 3/25.  Prior to 3/22 I will be out of the office at a power convention in St. Louis, returning Thursday 3/21.  I could then meet you at Monahans on 3/22 or sometime the following week.

let me know.
Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

Following up on our conversation re: Red Lake storage

assuming only a Phoenix lateral gets built off TW, no mainline or SJ expansion:
	Capital cost is estimated at $304mm.

A fully subscribed rate on volume of 750,000/d to get a 15% ROR would be $.152/MMBtu (with zero fuel retention).

If we assume a more gradual volume ramping up, beginning with 50% load factor in year 1 climbing to 100% in year 8, the target transport rate would need to be $.248 (closer to my "top of the head" $.30 we discussed yesterday).

Both of these scenarios assume 80/20 Debt/equity and a salvage value in year 20 of the project equal to 1/3 of the capital cost.

Also,
regarding the Kern River expansion, what might the likelihood be of Mojave receiving Kern gas and backhauling to TW for delivery into Aquila Red Lake?  If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.  We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.

if heat exhaust is counted in the "renewable" category, this would be another opportunity to take waste heat at TW compressor stations and convert it to electricity at above market rates.  We are looking at one of these opportunties at TW station 1.

kh

Kevin,

FYI--The New Mexico PRC has issued a proposed Renewable Energy Rule which would require providers of electricity to increase the percentage of their portfolio of energy supply from renewable sources.  Please review and let me know if this is something you feel we need to comment on.  My opinion would be that even if it impacted our business, it would be hard to argue against renewable sources of energy.  Below is the link to the proposed rule.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Good luck, is it the same outfit we've been working with who handles Red Cedar's production into TW?

going to "retire" and go to work contract for a small company in Columbus, TX. scheduling gas, doing some back office work, etc.

see what happens when you leave the gas bidness homey?  Williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group.  They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.  Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).  The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.  Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.
 
kh

Wow ... this is huge! 

I've met with executives of Mid-American Energy in the context of doing my Fiber Links business and I didn't come away too terribly impressed.  It's undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant, David Sokol, both have a reputation for finding ways to make money, but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of Mid-American that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River.  Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world?  

Jeff 

p.s.  While at Mojave, Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas control/operations puke like the rest of us.  He's apparently done quite well at KRGT.

Williams to sell Kern River for nearly $1B 
Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed 
to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings 
for nearly $1 billion. 
MidAmerican, a unit of investor Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, will pay 
Williams $450 million in cash and assume $510 million of Williams' debt in order to 
acquire Kern River. The deal, part of Williams' ongoing effort to strengthen its balance 
sheet, is set to close by March 31 assuming regulatory approvals. Williams said selling 
the Kern River system will save the company about $1.26 billion in capital expenses 
over the next 18 months. 
MidAmerican, meanwhile, said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline, 
which currently has a capacity of 835,000 Mcf/day and extends 926 miles from Opal, 
Wyo., to California's San Joaquin Valley. Built in 1992, it is a key route for shipping Rocky 
Mountain gas to markets in the western United States, particularly Southern California. 
The expansion project, due to be completed in May 2003, will more than double 
the pipeline's capacity to 1.7 Bcf/day, according to a filing Williams submitted to 
FERC in August. The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed $2 billion, 
MidAmerican said in a release. 
"We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission, which 
we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America," said David 
Sokol, MidAmerican's chairman and CEO. Upon completion of the sale, Kern River will 
become a subsidiary of MidAmerican. Bob Sluder, senior vice president and general man-ager 
of Williams' Kern River and Northwest systems, will become president of the new 
MidAmerican subsidiary. 
As for Williams, "We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to 
meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies, which now require com-panies 
like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investment-grade 
credit rating," President and CEO Steve Malcolm said. "The sale of our Kern River sys-tem 
is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our busi-nesses 
now and in the future." 
Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsa-based 
company delayed the release of its 2001 earnings to iron out debt issues related to 
the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary, which it spun off last year. Ear-lier 
this week, Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance $1.4 billion 
of WGC-related debt (GD 3/5). 
Williams' stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the 
heightened scrutiny of U.S. energy merchant companies in the wake of Enron's bankrupt-cy 
in December (GD 12/4). 
In releasing its earnings Thursday, Williams reported a 2001 net loss of $477.7 mil-lion, 
or 95?/share, compared with net earnings of $524.3 million or $1.17/share in 2000. 
The 2001 loss includes pre-tax charges of $2.05 billion relating to WGC. 
WGC said income from continuing operations for 2001 was $835.4 million, compared 
with $965.4 million a year earlier. The total WCG-related charges of $2.05 billion repre-sents 
80% of the total WCG-related guarantees and payment obligations, and the deferred 
payment for services provided to WCG, Williams said. 
Also Thursday, Williams said it will raise $275 million through the sale of 9.875% cumu-lative 
convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy 
Holdings. MEHC will acquire 1.46 million shares of the security at a price of $187.50/share, 
with each share of the security convertible into 10 shares of Williams' stock. The deal is expect-ed 
to close by March 31 and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction. 
MidAmerican, headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, is a privately owned energy 
provider with 10,000 employees. It provides gas and power to approximately 5 million 
customers.

The question below was forwarded to me by Aquila.  The question (in red) is from PPL.  What would be TW's strategy and can someone get back with PPL?

thanks
kh

Kevin, thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event PPL
opts to 
use it to meet any credit requirements.

I do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational 
sessions.  Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnect
with 
both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined based
on 
interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
pipeline 
about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded

questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm
deliveries 
from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
point 
to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas
on 
TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines. Sorry for the 
rambling question, but in valuating the asset, the question of
transportation 
inevitably comes up. 

Thanks
David

spoke with Bill Morgan.  At this point, he only has Mon - Tues 1/14-15 open.  He may have other openings if there are cancellations, we just have to let him know so he can call us.  The rut just started, they've taken some bucks off the place.  If we wanted to hunt an extra day, because we were there before, he would charge $150 per shooter.  If you wanted to bring a 3rd party, price would be the full $500 for a 2 day hunt.

Let me know what you want to do.  I'm flexible.

 
 
 
Martha Stewart's Tips for Arkansans
 
 GENERAL:

1. Never take a beer to a job interview
2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.
3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.
4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.
5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is
still considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.

DINING OUT:

1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt the
paper cup and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.
2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your hands.

ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:

1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared
by a taxidermist.
2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good
his manners are.

PERSONAL HYGIENE:

1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that
should done in private, using one's OWN truck keys.
2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.
3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days.
4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend
to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.

DATING (Outside the Family):

1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.
2. Be assertive, let her know you're interested: "I've been wanting to
go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago".
3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back.
Some will say 10:00 PM., others might say "Monday." If the latter is
the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.

THEATER ETIQUETTE:

1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up
immediately after the movie has ended.
2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have
proven they can't hear you.

WEDDINGS:

1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.
2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.
3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund
and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.
4. Though uncomfortable, say "yes" to socks and shoes for that
special occasion.

DRIVING ETIQUETTE:

1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun
is loaded and the deer is in sight.
2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest
tires does not always have the right of way.
3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.
4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is
impolite to ask her to bring back beer too.

 
SAD NEWS ABOUT BEER
You have to hope that this study is flawed, but the evidence seems irrefutable.  Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that the results of a recent analysis revealed the presence of female hormones in beer, and suggested that men should take a look at their beer consumption.

The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women.  To test the theory, 100 men were each fed 6 pints of beer within a one-hour period.  It was then observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing, had to sit down to pee, couldn't perform sexually, and refused to apologize when wrong.

No further testing is planned.

Nice.......

How was/is vacation? Austin's paper written? 

The stock market crash of 1929 and its impact on the Great Depression.  He can only use one electronic source, everything else has to be textual.  All the encyclopedias are on CD rom now, including sound bytes and movie clips.  Those are very cool.  

What is the topic of the paper? Yes, back when I was a tot we used World Book and the library. What do they do now? Scour the net? The encyclopedias were actually kind of cool 

Dean, 
	based on your schedule, how does Tues March 26 in the morning look for you to review the maintenance records for the Gomez lateral with Phil Allard from Pioneer?  How long do you think it will take, including a drive following the lateral route?

I would plan to fly out to Midland from Houston that Monday night, and be at the office for the meeting on Tuesday morning.  

Let me know as soon as you can please.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt

yes I did, thanks.  I'm comparing to the other quotes and will let you know next week.

Hi Kevin:
Did you receive the quote?
Adela

> 

Attached at the bottom of this email is the Staff powerpoint presentation
on their recommendation to the Commission on El Paso's Full Requirements
service (FR).  The Staff Recommendation is not yet available.

Summary

As noted in yesterday's email, Staff is recommending the following general
principles:
-  The Commission convert El Paso's Full Requirements service (FR) to
Contract Demand service (CD)
- Allocation of CD be based on the greater of (1) a shipper's billing
determinants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (a
shipper's own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001
- The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based on
El Paso's proposed 20 pooling point configuration
- A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by the
Commissioners, on the Staff recommendations

Background

Staff recounted the issue on El Paso's system, including the question to be
decided by the Commission: has El Paso's FR service become unjust and
unreasonable?  Staff believes it has, and explains that it is within the
Commission's jurisdiction to allocate El Paso's capacity in order to:
      (1) restore system flexibility
      (2) end uncertainty (in the form of pro rata capacity cuts) of firm
delivery
      (3) ensure full & fair utilization of El Paso's system

According to Staff's presentation, the problems on El Paso's system are due
to changes in system load since the pipeline's 1996 settlement.  A major
increase in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996
(which was nearly one half unsold at that time) has changed the operations
and capacity availability on El Paso, resulting in frequent capacity
constraints on the system.  This problem is aggravated by the settlement's
resultant rate freeze, which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso to
expand or upgrade its system.

Recommendations (Bob Petrocelli presenting)

Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD, while maintaining
(1) the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement, and 2) a small
amount of FT-2 FR contracts (for small customers, such as municipalities),
with an overall cap on the rate schedule.  This will "balance the interests
of all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system."  Also, it
will send the proper price signals for system expansions.

In comments on this and related proceedings, shippers have recommended four
allocation methods for the converted CD:
      (1) 1996 settlement bid determinants
      (2) system peak (coincidental demand)
      (3) individual peak (non-coincidental demand)
      (4) some combo of the above

Staff recommends utilizing the greater of #1 or #2 (using Sept. 12, 2001,
as benchmark demand day).  This reflects current usage mitigated by the
settlement capacity contracts.

Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights,
using El Paso's proposed expanded 20 pool system [in this proposal, El Paso
narrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools].
As support of this recommendation, Staff noted:
      (1) it is consistent with the Commission's one-time delivery point
allocation in BR/Amoco/Topock complaint case
      (2) gives certainty for supply to all shippers
      (3) enhances the tradeability of capacity
      (4) eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basin

Commissioners' Discussion

Pat Wood:  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective and
will never be approved by him.  Whether the Staff recommendation is the
best fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference.
Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will be
different -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlement's intent was to
keep the system viable at all, and changes are needed to move to next step.
Wood also noted that "this wouldn't have happened if El Paso had complied
with Order 636 -- it's a lesson on the power side that we not carve out
exceptions."

Nora Brownell:  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure,
how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled, and if this addresses
future capacity needs.  Staff responded that this is "an economic fix to
the current disincentives for El Paso expansions," and that there are
proposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs.

Bill Massey: Stated that the current situation is "intolerable" and that
Staff's presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because
"bold Commission action is necessary here."

Linda Breathitt:  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelines
using FR service, and was told no, only some intrastate municipalities
still utilize FR on a commodity demand basis.

thanks Blair, we've been following the FR debate very closely.

Last week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contrac=
ts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the o=
riginal 1996 El Paso settlement.  The indicated shippers last year did file=
 a Section 5 complaint against El Paso, accusing the pipeline of over selli=
ng its capacity.  This debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in get=
ting shippers to commit to the Sun Devil project.

You may know this, but I thought I'd pass it on since it was mostly new to =
me.

El Paso has two types of firm customers, which are CD (contract demand) and=
 FR (full requirements) customers. FR customers are allowed to schedule an =
amount up to their full meter capacity as long as capacity is available. Ho=
wever, FR customers pay El Paso a fixed reservation charge and  volumes exc=
eeding FR quantities are billed El Paso's usage rate. FR customer loads hav=
e increased rapidly in the last few years as growth in the states east of C=
alifornia has surged. With these increased loads the FR customers have been=
 getting a tremendous deal since they pay only the usage charge on incremen=
tal volumes exceeding their FR quantities. FR customers argue that they are=
 entitled to this benefit since they bargained for it in EL Paso's last rat=
e proceeding. El Paso's last settlement was similar to TW's in that custome=
rs agreed to certain benefits in exchange for paying higher rates to resolv=
e capacity turnback issues. The FR customer's good deal is a problem becaus=
e 1) FR customer's increased volumes have led to capacity prorations making=
 it more difficult for other shippers to get cheaper San Juan gas, 2) these=
 prorations in conjunction with the scheduling cycles make it difficult for=
 shippers to get scheduled, 3) El Paso has no financial incentive to expand=
 because the FR customers will use the capacity and pay only the usage rate=
, and 4) the FR customers ability to take gas has prevented El Paso from of=
fering services such as park and loan and storage service that other custom=
ers want. Absent FERC action, FR customers will retain the benefits of the =
settlement until El Paso's next rate case in 2006.

The Commission is threatening to initiate a Section 5 proceeding to address=
 capacity allocation issues on El Paso and has directed Staff to convene a =
technical conference next month to address these issues (see March 18, 2002=
 Inside FERC).  The conference probably won't occur until at least late Apr=
il because El Paso is bogged down in their market abuse proceeding.

It was nice meeting you too!  Please feel free to email or call anytime with questions or concerns regarding Austin.  I was impressed by the Study Skills program explained last night.  If this class was made a 6th grade requirement, I think it would go a long way in better preparing the kids for when they get to your class.

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

Mr. Hyatt:
I'm just making sure I have your name in my address book correctly. It was certainly nice to meet you in person last night, and I hope things continue to look up for Austin.
I look forward to reading his research paper, as you obviously had him working extra hard on it over Spring Break. Thanks for your involvement and support.
Have a great weekend! Crescida McCue

FERC has announced a technical conference for discusssion of allocation issues on El Paso's system for April 16, 2002.
Click below for the notice:

http://cips.ferc.gov/Q/CIPS/GAS/RP/RP00-336.002.TXT

At the public meeting on March 13, staff made a presentation, recommending that El Paso convert Full Requirements shippers to Contract Demand; provide capacity rights of the greater of billing determinant or coincidental peak; maintain the existing rate structure; maintain the 1996 settlement; and accept El Paso's proposed 20 pooling areas up from the existing 3 areas. Staff concluded that El Paso's firm service is unreliable and recommended the Commission set a technical conference.

our fax number is really 646-3225.  Apparently facilities gave us the wrong number.  I tested this new number and it works.
kh
We now have a fax machine located in front of EB4079.  The fax number is 713/646-2700.  There are fax cover sheets in a tray on the table for your convenience.

ETSMarketingA  (the network printer from 13) hitched a ride with us and is available for you to print to.  Same location as fax machine.

Bonnie White is the attorney.  I have already called her to find out what our collection process is (if any).  I know some guys named Guido and Mario who'll be happy to do it for 50% of the money.  I'll let you know what I find out.
kh

Kevin,

Who in legal have you been working with?  Tracy was wondering when we thought we would receive the money.

Thanks, Kim.

Any idea when or if we will receive the money?

FYI, Kim.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

kh

This is already pretty much done I believe. Let me check with Steve Dickerson and I'll let you know.
kh

Kevin - Could we sit down and talk about this?  You may be more up to date on all these plants than I am.

Lorraine,

Would you please take a look at the attached spreadsheet and determine which power plants may be close to our pipeline.  Bill Wood would like us to respond by mid November.  

Thanks, Kim.

Can you please have someone in the group take a look at this so we can respond promptly? Thanks.

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.

Hi everyone!!

	For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.  You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  

Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.

Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  

I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  

If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.  Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.    

Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!

Look at the El Paso exp.  This isn't the one already is service.

FYI, KIm.

Attached is an updated Interstate Pipeline Capacity to California Report with changes and additions highlighted.  gh

 Can I get an instruction booklet for a model 1560 (serial 1650338)? 

Please send to:

Also, my unit keeps flashing "L" and beeping after being plugged in for only a few minutes and I can't get it to quit.  Do I need to reset the unit?  I'm assuming the "L" means Laser detected.

thanks

I am supposed to hook up Monday with the guys from Home Entertainment to review the requirements for the sound / projector system.  We will hopefully do a sight visit early next week.

Saddam Hussein was sitting in his office wondering whom to invade next when
his telephone rang.

"Hallo! Mr. Hussein," a heavily accented voice said. "This is Paddy down
at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we
are officially declaring war on you!"

"Well, Paddy," Saddam replied, "This is indeed important news! How big is
your army?"

"Right now," said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, "there is myself,
my cousin Sean, my next door neighbour Seamus, and the entire dart team from
the pub. That makes eight!"

Saddam paused. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my
army waiting to move on my command."

"Begorra!", said Paddy. "I'll have to ring you back!"

Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. "Mr. Hussein, the war is
still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!"

"And what equipment would that be, Paddy?" Saddam asked.

"Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor."

Saddam sighed. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and
14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1-1/2
million since we last spoke."

"Saints preserve us!" said Paddy. "I'll have to get back to you."

Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. "Mr. Hussein, the war is
still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified
Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four
boys from the Shamrock pub have joined us as well!"

Saddam was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. "I must tell
you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and 20,000 fighter planes. My
military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. 
And
since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!"

"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!", said Paddy, "I'll have to ring you back."

Sure enough, Paddy called again the next day. "Top o' the mornin', Mr.
Hussein! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war."

"I'm sorry to hear that," said Saddam. "Why the sudden change of heart?"

"Well," said Paddy, "we've all had a long chat over a bunch of pints, and
there's no way we can feed two million prisoners."

that was a good one!!

but did he pass the drug test?  Good for him.  I hope he makes it thru boot camp.
Have fun on your trip.  I was going to ask you for a ride home tomorrow but you won't be here.  I'm selling the Maxima to Cathy Corbin for her son.  Now if I can get the stock price up, I may actually be able to afford a truck.  Have you seen the new Dodge-- way cool!!

Who would have thought? My brother, Todd (Odd with a T), very smart but got off the path and never made it back on, just swore into the Navy. He will be training in San Antonio (Military Police). He signed on for 5 years.......the longest commitment to anything in his life! He scored extremely well on all their tests. I am proud of him!

According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions.

Dear Dr. Lay--
	
	Thank you for your presentation yesterday.  As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.  I was literally mortified when I heard the "crack" question-- but I think you handled that well too.  As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.  

Thanks for your continued hard work and support.

Is that "instant bam" an offer or just a suggestion?  I hear a mattress comes standard with every new truck purchase.

Yep....and all the medical. He stopped smoking pot like 3-4 months ago. As you might remember he had several head injuries and was on a medication(s) to level out the ol brain waves. He quit those. Apparently, he is operating well on no meds and no pot. 

Who knew Todd might get a life! 

You know if you get one of those Ford 250s you could have instant bam anywhere you go in that flatbed!!

Please review the announcement for EIA before I send it in.

 << File: Enron in Action Submission FormEnronKids.doc >> 

Sun Devil is going well.  We're working to get contracts closed for the shippers going to Phoenix.  I need to send you the draft precedent agreement so you can start going thru it and making any necessary modifications.  I'll get that to you shortly. 

take care

Kevin:  You wound me.  I was the person that called you by error, I was trying to call Michelle and dialed your number by mistake.  

So by the time I was saying who I was you had already hung up, ouch!  Sorry for the boo boo.

Hey how's is everything going?  Sometimes I hate bid week, it's too busy I don't have enough time to check in with people.  Did Michelle tell you we picked up some more transport from her on TW and may no longer be looking for more.  How's the Sun Devil project going anyway?  I haven't heard any word lately.

Hope all is well with you, take care,

Nancy-- any word on the El Paso shipper comments that were due on 10/15.  El Paso is to file its reply today 10/26.
thanks
kh

Sure.  Probably the best method is for us to overnight them to you -- we can email filings made at the Commission if you can use an Image reading program -- I'll work with my assistant on it and may do a test with you.

Will let you know.

Hi Nancy--
	yesterday the Full Requirements shipper responses were due at FERC.  If it's not too voluminous, can I get a copy emailed or faxed?

I'm travelling till Monday but if you need to talk, page me at 888-582-7421.

	Mr. Colin Wilkes from General Electric Power Systems has agreed to present for NGI Session C on 3/20.  He will cover two topics including "Changing gas quality specs and their impact to turbines" and "Pressure Reliability".  He is preparing his initial draft which should be available in the next two weeks.

Please forward to him a conference invitation at your earliest convenience.  Contact info is as follows:

Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O. DoubleTree, Dave mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with Dave to see if he's had any success?

thanks

Jose, 
	Mr. Colin Wilkes from GE in Schenectady has agreed to speak on the topics below.  Thanks for your help.  We need to get together and have lunch to discuss the Sun Devil project on TW.  Talk with you soon.

Kevin Hyatt

Kevin,

I have not forgotten about you.  I'll follow up next week.  Have a good week
end!  Jose.

Hi Jose--
	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference
will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is
www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html

One of our proposed speaking topics is "Changing Gas Quality Specs"  and
the impact to today's turbines which are supposedly much more sensitive
to gas specs than older generation units.  Another potential topic is
"Pressure Reliability" dealing with the impact to gen units with varying
fuel pressures.

I'm looking for an expert at GE Power Systems who would be willing to
give a 15-30 minute presentation on either of these topics on the
afternoon of March 20, 2002.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other
presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  

If you have someone who may be interested, please let me know and I can
send them a formal invitation or just have them call me direct.  Thanks
for the help!

We got one wood duck out of the Moccasin hole.  We stayed till about 9:30.  We did see 5 or 6 big ducks pass way over the top of the hole, but nothing came close.

There was a lot of shooting to the east of us throughout the morning, but I wasn't sure if it was you or someone else.

Sun Devil: 
Sonoran Pipeline -  Calls to various levels of Kinder-Morgan management have elicited no response.  Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having "marketing issues".
ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement.
Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost.
Marketing -
	Duke - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a "competitive" rate.  Preparing rate 	offerings for their review 11/5.
	AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.  They are very interested in the project and would commit today if they were given an economic out based on unfavorable 	outcome of El Paso / FERC full requirements proceeding.  Working to develop an MOU with out clause if they fund the early EIS work.
	Sempra - No response yet.
	Southwest Gas - Still interested in the project but unwilling to commit due to El Paso full requirements issue.  They are however interested in doing a JV to 	utilize their Phoenix lateral to enable the Sun Devil project to tie into the El Paso south system.
	Panda Energy - Meeting set in Dallas on 11/2.  Panda has the capability to be the anchor shipper for the project.

Preparing detailed supply basin study for management review.
El Paso / FERC  - waiting on response from Regulatory to review recently submitted comments.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002.  
Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Open season for the proposed West Phoenix storage facility began 10/15 and was to close 10/24 but was extended an additional week for market participants.

 

Attached are the notes for your meeting in Albuquerque.  Please avoid discussing the cost figures (it tends to reach competitive ears).  If anyone has any questions, or any competitive intelligence on the Sonoran project, please have them call me.

thanks
kh

yes please.
thanks

Do either of you want the complete/partial certificate filing of Kern River's New Kramer Junction Delivery Point into SoCal's planned Adelanto Lateral?

Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.  It would be great if you could develop something for item 5.  I think Orlando Alvarado is having difficulty getting anyone from Williams signed up for it.  As for item 6, I may have an interested party for that one but I'll keep you posted.

thanks again,
kh

Kevin, we have not yet had the opportunity to meet as I have not been able to
make it to the Committee meetings as Carrie had set-up. Taking a look at the
Agenda, I can probably help with items 5 or 6 and would be happy to develop and
deliver a presentation or would ensure that a senior representative from
Enbridge would do that. My natural tendency (with my current position in
Northern Pipeline Development) would be towards the Agenda Item No. 5 (New
Supply  Sources), but I probably could find a good resource within Enbridge to
present some views and thinking on the Infrastructure De-bottlenecking item.

Please let me know what you think............ wayne

I look forward to the Conference and to getting a chance to meet you.

Hi everyone!!

           For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin
Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.
You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an
interest in serving on the committee.

Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4
sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were
developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee
members and the Trade Fair Group staff.

Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15
(highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the
comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we
are trying to present for the conference attendees.

I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only
confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the
agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the
topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should
last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.

If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.
Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair
Group confirming their attendance.

Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or
Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!

Kevin--
	As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called "Panda Gila River L.P."

Here are some of the details as we know them:
	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced
	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)
	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)
	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale
	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market

What we want to know is:
	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs)
How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?

What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?

Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6.
thanks for the help.

thanks for the update on the Cougar.  I need to try and see him this weekend.

I am trying to get a customer to join us for Friday, he'll be in town Thursday and may stay over.  Let me know if you want robo-duck for tues.

   Estimated annual storage costs are $15mm if my math is correct.  

thanks Buzz, this helps alot.
kh

To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cent.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.

Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:

1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440

So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affect the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.

Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.

Sonoran Pipeline -  Market intelligence indicated KMI personnel are canvassing the Phoenix market to solicit interest in a new lateral off the proposed Sonoran project.  El Paso Natural Gas is also supposedly contacting their CD customers to verify interest in expanding the Maricopa lateral.
Marketing -
	Panda Energy - Meeting scheduled for 11/6 in Dallas to pitch various rate structures.
	AZ Public Service -  Will schedule next meeting based on Panda response to proposals.
	
Preparing detailed supply basin study and Phoenix supply / demand balance for management review.
El Paso / FERC  - Reviewing comments recently submitted.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002.  
Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Submitted non-binding bid for 100% of Copper Eagle storage capacity for 10 year term ($15mm/year).

To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cent.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.

Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:

1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440

So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affect the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.

Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.

Couldn't another explanation be that the Board DID UNDERSTAND the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the Chinese Walls and protections were put in place?

I don't believe the Board members would shirk their responsibilities (as you pointed out, most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions) if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals.

I am out of the office travelling 11/12, returning 11/13.  Let me know if you have an alternate time/day and what topic you would like to meet about.

HELLO,

message from Doug Pedigo
 
 
The shooting east of you was actually southeast, mostly south of me and off our property.  I hunted at the southeast corner of our property, 2 miles from the front gate.  We got 1 mallard and 3 woodducks, but did not see a big number of ducks.  The water dropped 1.5 feet from the day before and had mostly receded completely off our property.  The mallards and woodies had followed the water south -- that's what all the shooting was.  They really got into them down there.  We are competely dry in the woods now.

Ben and Ron--
	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?

Ron, 
	can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.

What would be the pressure if we don't install stations 1.5 and Kingman?  My thinking is we might not have enough market at Cal Border to require those stations.

Kevin,

That is the scenario where we installed all 36" pipe and added two new stations (Station #1.5 & Kingman).  The pressure to Panda will be greater than 600 psig.  The lateral is off the discharge of Station #1.5 which keeps the pressure profile up.  Looking at a minimum of 750 psig with and upside of 900 psig.  Hope this helps.

Thank you, Kevin.

Attached please find further information on the Starline Technology. I have
seen this process in action and believe it to be a great tool for
rehabilitating gas mains and services. 

As discussed, I have included contact information for our Director of this
technology, Ted Fiala. You will find it in the PowerPoint presentation. 

If chosen to speak, we would be more than happy to work on developing a
presentation based on our experiences with major utility players and perhaps
be able to bring them along to discuss the technology as well.

Thank you very much for reviewing the information and I look forward to
hearing from you.

Hi Harvey--

	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.

One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.

I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  

After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!

I got this information out a little late last year so here is a heads up.  The Needles 38th annual golf tournament is scheduled for the 5th and 6th of April.  The tournament involves Transwestern, SoCal, El Paso, PG&E, Soutwest etc....

Randy Williams (team leader for the Kingman team) can be contacted for additional information.  Also, Randy, would you please put Steve, Kim and Kevin on your distribution list for the golf registration flyers once they become available.  

Oh yea, if dollars are available we could use about 60 dozen golf balls or any items that you might like distributed during the tournament.  If you or someone from your group would like to tie the golf tournament into a quick tour of the Red Rock facilities let me know and I will coordinate those details.  Thanks

James & David --
	Can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for Sun Devil that incorporates a Straight - Fixed Variable rate design along the following parameters using 15, 20 and 25 year terms:

San Juan utilization: 85% of 780,000/MMBtu/d
Mainline: 85% utilization of 810,000/MMBtu/d
Phoenix lateral: 75% utilization of 500,000 MMBtu/d

Also, prepare some ROE sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 10% and rises by 10%. 

I will be out of town till Tues 11/13.  Can we get together that morning and review your analyses?

page me if you have questions at 888-582-7421

thanks

What a meltdown.  As for me, I'm the new boy - creating a new job.  Not

We will likely not have a problem until after the merger closes next year.  I think for this year we'll be fine.  

All,
If you read the question/answer area regarding the merger it appears that the matching fund program may not survive.  Therefore, we may need to do more shopping with our Enron Kid account funds than we originally planned.  Do we need to meet to discuss a contingency plan?
Thanks, LV 

I'm working on a replacement.

Didn't David's son play baseball with Austin?  I think I saw him last night with his son at Austin's basketball practice.
 
This is a Russian built Antonov-12   (Russian equiv.of the C-130 Herc).  I brought it in this afternoon, put 12 tons of pipe on it for Barcelona, Venz. You might recognize David Howser in a cpl of them.
BRgds,
Dad
 
 
Jim:
Here are some pictures of the Kvaerner charter. The plane was a Antonov 12. 
Also, Ron Porter wanted me to thank you for the Rockets game.

Recent pricing on two models is:

Benelli Sport (removable vent ribs) for serious competitive shooters is $1145.  This model is very similar to the Montefeltro.

Montefeltro (I shoot this one) with wood stock, 12 gauge, 26" or 28" bbl is $845.  You can also get the M1 (same as Montefeltro but with black syn stock) for same price.  Both shoot 2.75 and 3 inch shells.  Both come with 5 choke tubes.

Let me know if you have further questions.

I'll look at other sizes / kids in her grade and call you back.
kh

Kevin,
Sorry to be a pest about this but my wife is being insistent that we are off base on the sizes.
My adopted child is 4 years old and she is listing sizes of 7 shirt/8 pants and 12 shoes.
My wife says that she buys clothes for our nieces:  one of which is six years old and wears
a size 7 and shoe size 2.
Our adopted child is two years younger and asking for the same size in clothes and asking for shoe size 12?

I don't want to be a pest but my wife is concerned on the sizes and we don't want to goof up when we give the clothes to Rocio.
Is there a way to see what other 4 year olds are asking for in sizes?

No meeting today but here's the update.

We had our meeting with AZ Public Service on Friday 11/16.  Here's the highlights:

30 year term is not a deal killer
Rates & fuel are high but San Juan gas price helps
They like the pressure guarantee
They like being able to swing the volume within the day

APS has electric line ROW that may include underground ROW going south towards El Paso.  If so, we may be able to use this path to reach Panda and the El Paso system at a reduced cost.  APS will check it out and get back with me. 

Next steps:  meetings are being set up with Duke, Sempra, and PG&E for the week after Thanksgiving.

El Paso / FERC full requirments debate:
	A straw man settlement proposal was floated at FERC by one of the FR shippers.  FERC still wants the parties to negotiate a settlement but so far there has been little progress.

due to Conf room conflict (Ken Lay needed our room!).  We'll do it on Tues at 3:30 in 15c1.  We'll update you on the Phoenix meetings last week plus the Desert Crossing project.  

let me know if you have questions.
kh

we will have the adoption table set up Tues thru Fri this week on the 2nd floor from 11:00 to 1 in Enron Center North.  Please stop by.  thanks

Kevin - I would like to sponsor and shop for a child.  Who should I contact?

go ahead with your plans.  The adoption table will be available on the 2nd floor of ECN on Tues - Fri this week 11:00 - 1

The ETS Solution Center was going to go pick out a child today at lunch.  Please let us know if it's better to go through you, or go ahead with our plans.

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!
Kevin Hyatt x35559 & The Enron Kids Committee

thanks BOB!! We'll take care of the shopping.

You can count on me for $100,  but NOOO SHOPPING!

if the money was submitted for deposit in the Enron Kids Credit Union account prior to 11/20, then it should be matched.
thanks for your support.

I donated $200 to this program believing it would be matched by Enron...I suppose now it won't be. Mike

anything donated and submitted to the EK Credit Union account prior to 11/20 will be matched.  After 11/20 we are SOL.

I saw a note today that stated this program has been indefinitely suspended.

attached is the info for JP Morgan.  Let me know if you have questions.

you are SOOOOO GOOD!!

Guys,
Would you like to adopt a kid?  And no, you do not have to legally adopt the kid (believe it or not that is one of the questions that was asked which totally cracked me up).  I am assisting Kevin Hyatt and we have 240 kids left.  Fire Sale!  Get your kid now, happy hour special, two for one all the time!  Just give me your money and I will shop (imagine that - I will shop).

Spoke with Jim Adams at Panda this p.m.  His new guy Steve Curley is now on board working transportation for Panda.  Jim and Steve will likely call us Tues pm or Wed with a short list of questions on the project.  Jim is also waiting on feedback from TECO on our proposal.

good analysis-- maybe you should consider a new career as an ESPN sports commentator.  Who knows, it might pay pretty good.

thanks
kh

OK, for the Husker fans out there, in a time when I know you need a boost in morale after the fiasco in Boulder Saturday...

Check this out...   

First, below is the current Bowl Championship Standings for this week...

http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.html

Talk about respect for Nebraska.  Even after a 62-36 shellacking, they only fell to #4 in the BCS standings.  Below are the possibilities for each team in the top 6...

http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/1119/1280619.html

So, you would think that would mean...   if two of the teams ahead of you lose this weekend, you guys would be in the championship game.  By comparison, Texas needs both Miami and Florida to lose to make it to the game, because of strength of schedule, quality wins, etc.  

So, let's take that theory one step further...

1)  If both Miami and Florida lose you would think that would pit Nebraska and Texas against each other in the Rose Bowl.  Wow, a Big 12 National Championship!

2)  Texas still has to beat Colorado.  If Texas loses and one of the two top teams loses, it would seem like you guys are in as well.

But you know the computers will come up with some cockemamy calculation that won't make any sense.

In closing, consider the following facts regarding this weekend's games...

Miami could lose their last game away at dangerous Va. Tech.  A win over the 'Canes would make the season for the Hokies (see Oklahoma State).  Remember that Va. Tech was a top 5 team at one point this year and they are playing at home.   Also...  Miami has lost 5 out of the last 6 to Va. Tech!
Florida could lose to Tennessee -or- if they beat the 'Vols, they could lose to what appears will be a very dangerous LSU team in the SEC championship.
On the flip side - Tennessee could lose to Florida -or- if they beat the Gators, could end up against that same LSU team.
Lastly, there is the Jekyl & Hide longhorns playing against the Jekyl & Hide buffalos.

Hey...   stranger things have happened.  The possibilities are endless, as they say at 1400 Smith (at least for now).  Of course, that may be a dangerous correlation.

Mark

That's very good!!!  I can't imagine the struggle you face everyday.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.

Thanks for dinner last night - I enjoyed talking with you and meeting Eric..... Here is the poem you requested.

Paranoid 

Do you really care what I have to say? 
Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway? 
Should I sit here like a statue in stone? 
Do I really like feeling so alone? 

What did I do to the world to feel this way? 
Why am I so paranoid everyday? 
My mind lives in a constant shade of black 
I always want to run and pack 

To find a world that's all my own 
Somewhere I can finally call home 
But the fear remains with me   
It's all I can see 

Why does everybody stare? 
Or even glare 
They say it's all in my head 
It's like I'm a ghost back from the dead 

It's scary to be left alone 
Even inside my own home 
Everyone's out to get me 
All after me 

Now when you ask me what's wrong? 
It takes me too long 
To figure out 
What the questions about 

Do you really care what I have to say? 
Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway? 
Should I sit here like a statue in stone? 
Do I really like feeling so alone?

A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.

A saleswoman is driving through the Reservation toward home when she
sees an Indian woman thumbing for a ride on the side of the road.

As the trip had been long and quiet, she stops the car and the Indian
woman gets in.  After a bit of small talk, the Indian woman notices a
brown bag on the front seat.

"What's in the bag?" asks the Indian woman.

"It's a bottle of wine.  I got it for my husband,"
says the saleswoman.

The Indian woman is silent for a moment then says, "Good trade."

Hi Don--
	I picked up one of your flyers.  I'm looking for storage for my 2000 Expedition to hold hunting equipment.  What configurations do you have?  Also, would you be willing to sell the plans (copyrighted of course).  I have a pretty extensive wood shop and might want to make the box myself.

It was good to talk with you this morning.  As mentioned to you yesterday, =
following is some information on a project that I've been working on.  I'd =
appreciate your assitance in getting the word out regarding this project.  =
=20

As you are aware, there are many families that have been affected by the re=
cent layoffs at Enron.  I along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler a=
nd Sue Nix) have been working on a project which will provide assistance to=
 ex-employees of Enron. We wanted to do something to help our fellow employ=
ees and also provide a tool that others could use to provide assistance to =
ex-Enron employees.   Just think, if 100 people donated $50 each that would=
 be $5000 that we could give to ex-employees for assistance as needed for b=
asic necessities (such as money for food, to pay their rent/mortgage, or ut=
ilites).  I know the ex-employees would really appreciate this assistance. =
 I've already started getting e-mails at eerfarequest@surfmk.com <mailto:ee=
rfarequest@surfmk.com> requesting assistance.  We've set up guidelines on h=
ow we'll be distributing the funds. This week, we've been working with an a=
ttorney and a local bank. An account has been set up where people can make =
contributions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron employees that =
need assistance with basic necessities, such as money for food, rent/mortga=
ge payments, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the inform=
ation so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our abil=
ity to provide assistance will be based on the response we receive.  As you=
 can see, we're using our values from Enron to help others, and would appre=

Doug--
	We are working up a proposal for APS in Phoenix wherein they would share in a portion of the costs we incur to get the project's FERC application ready.  Tab 5 of the original cost book shows a cost of $8,750,301.  Is this still a good number to use for our APS proposal?  Let's talk Wed 1/23 if possible.  

thanks

It was nice to meet you at the Sempra dinner last week.

We got 8 ducks on Sunday morning, but lost 2.  We should've downed about 3 more.  Can you go next Wed morning 12/19?

Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.  They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.  Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.  They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.  

I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option.

is this form on-line?  If so, how do I get to it.  It doesn't appear under "forms" on HRweb.
thanks

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Kevin,
attached is the Sun Devil powerpoint presentation we gave to Stan back in December.  I added one slide since called Project Rationale.  The document probably has more detail than you need but more is better right?  Let me know if you need help cutting it down.

Can you tell me where to find the FASB 92 and 71 descriptions?  
thanks

-- Desert Crossing Storage (near Kingman, AZ).  Their strategic advantage seems to be accessing cheaper Rockies gas via Kern River and putting it into storage for later delivery to California markets.  One partner, SRP, is banking on getting a firm backhaul on El Paso to serve their Phoenix requirements.  Unless someone significantly expands the California infrastructure and interstate delivery points, the only beneficiary of this project will be Sempra with its North Baja power plant and this is not enough to justify the storage project.

--  Pataya Storage is another project soon to be announced by partners SouthWest Gas and Aquila Energy.  They plan to develop 12 Bcf of salt dome storage (in 2 phases) in the same formation as Desert Crossing.  Their plan is to tie into El Paso and TW; we have been in contact and await their response to our suggestion of incorporating a Sun Devil pipeline option.

--  Our response to APS on the transport option if they reimburse TW for EIS costs is expected to go out 1/25.  We are drafting a similar offer to Panda Energy.

--  Panda Energy:  The current economic conditions have struck Panda-- they have initiated a restructuring and severed some of the headquarters staff including fuel supply representatives we were negotiating with for Sun Devil.  The project now reverts back to the department VP whom we have contacted to further our negotiations. 

Engineering -  still waiting on the revised project cost estimate based on the reduced compressor and looping costs.  The goal is $100 million in reductions.  

FERC and El Paso Full Requirements Contracts - The discussion of the Strawman settlement proposal submitted by SRP to FERC did not make it on FERC's January agenda.  At our meeting this week, APS did not put much faith in the Strawman making much forward progress.  

radio reports say he had a gunshot wound to the head and left a note.

We sincerely regret to inform you of a tragedy that occurred earlier today.  Cliff Baxter passed away this morning.  Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes.

The Sun Devil model is pretty big, over 2000kb, I'm not sure how well it will email but we can try it.  We may want to send a backup on a 100mb zip drive disk.  Do they have the ability to read the zip disk?

Kim and Eric:
Could we send to ArcLight the models for TransPecos and Sun Devil that reflect what we had in today's presentation? You can either send directly to him (and cc me) or send to me and I will forward on to them.  Everyone did a great job today.  Thanks again.
Kevin

Where are you at and I'll bring you a packet with an explanation?

I'll take one, just let me know what I need to do.

at this point I have several on my desk now and others that will be coming to me shortly.  Cost is about $55 - $75 per child, depending on how good a shopper you are.  Let me know how many kids you'd like.

thanks

Kevin,

Are you still looking for sponsors for the Enron Kids program?  Sean Bolks said you had 14 kids that needed sponsors last Friday.

Let me know,

Thanks,

Preston

PRESS RELEASE:Utilicorp Unit To Develop Ariz. Facility >UCU
Jan 31 at 15:20

  ( BW)(MO-AQUILA)(UCU) Aquila Set to Develop Arizona Gas Storage Facility
  Business Editors
  KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2002--Aquila, the wholly owned
subsidiary of UtiliCorp United (NYSE: UCU), announced today that it has
purchased the Red Lake Storage Project from Southwest Gas Corporation.
  The purchase includes 36,000 acres approximately 30 miles north of Kingman,
Arizona, and the rights to develop a salt cavern storage facility. Along with
the land, Aquila purchased the water and mineral rights necessary to develop the
facility.
  The facility will have a gas storage capacity of 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf).
The first phase of the facility, with a storage capacity of 6 Bcf, is expected
to be in operation by the fourth quarter of 2003, with the full 12 Bcf planned
for the fourth quarter of 2004. The facility will connect to pipelines operated
by El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline and Transwestern Pipeline Company. Aquila
anticipates beginning an open season for the facility within the next seven to
ten days. In an open season period a company seeks storages commitments from
potential clients.
  "This facility fits with our strategy to build or acquire assets that enable
us to provide clients with the energy they need when they encounter dramatic
increases in demand," said Ed Mills, president and chief operating officer of
Aquila.
  The facility is positioned to serve Arizona power plants, as well as other
facilities in Nevada and California. There are approximately 60 gas-fired power
plants in Arizona, representing one of the largest single concentrations of such
facilities in the United States
  "Southwest Gas Corporation is pleased to see the Red Lakes Storage Project
being developed," said Ed Zub, executive vice president of Southwest Gas
Corporation. "Development of this project will benefit the states of Arizona and
Nevada where Southwest Gas Corporation serves more than 1.1 million customers."
  Aquila currently owns one of the largest independent storage facilities in the
southwest, a 21 Bcf facility in Katy, Texas. The company is also currently
completing the acquisition of a storage facility near Lodi, California, which
will provide gas to the frequently energy-short cities in northern California.
With the addition of the Red Lake Storage Project, Aquila will be one of the
largest independent storage providers for power plants and local gas
distribution companies in the Southwest.
  Based in Kansas City, Aquila is a leading wholesaler of natural gas, power and
coal in North America and provider of risk management services. Aquila also
provides wholesale energy and risk management services in the United Kingdom,
Germany and Scandinavia. Aquila is wholly owned by Kansas City-based UtiliCorp
United, an international energy company with 4 million customers across the U.S.
and in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. Additional
information is available at www.aquila.com, or contact Mark D. Cook at 816/527-
1369.

Can we schedule 1-2 hours early next week to go over Sun Devil, including economics and assumptions? In addition, I want to discuss the financial model that we need for ArcLight.  I am assuming that at the  $0.45 rate, this should be a slam dunk for you guys!

why is it that ugly people are always the first ones to take their clothes off?

Not only were we Enron employees smart but good looking and uninhibited......

Due to conflict with Stan Horton's meeting this afternoon (2/5).  We will reconvene at the regular time on 2/12.

I invited Mark Brand to join us.  I am trying to arm twist him into staying with Enron and work with me on this pipe project.  Let's talk Fri a.m. on where we want to go.

Attached is the Sun Devil model using the $911mm Capex and project life of 30 years.  The model is somewhat complex and may require spending some time on the phone with James Centilli, the model's designer.  We will make ourselves available at your convenience.

I sent the model that matches up with the information we have already submitted to them.  

Why aren't we using the lower capex number with the lower rates?

A couple drove several miles down a country road, not saying a word.

  An earlier discussion had led to an argument and neither wanted to concede
  their position.

  As they passed a barnyard full of mules and pigs, the husband
sarcastically
  asked, "Relatives of yours?"

  "Yep," the wife replied, "in-laws."

How the hell you been doing Kevin?  Someone told me that the new name for EnronOnLine was going to be UB SOL.   

 

I looked over the entire list.  It amazes me what some people got, including those in my group.

depending on how things shake out with sun devil this week, I'd like to tentatively plan on taking this Friday 2/15 off.  Let me know if there's a problem.

thanks

I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):

1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.

	Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?

2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC

	APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility).  

If I can set it up, are you available for breakfast with Panda on Wed morning?  How early?

regards, 
kevin

Panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time.  The will likely be in our office around 1:30pm Tues and we should be done around 3:30 -4pm if you finish with Stan early and would like to join us.

thanks

I can make it by 8.

David, 
	glad to hear you're hanging in there.  I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.  They were looking for an analyst.  Did anyone contact you?

It's been tough with Sun Devil.  We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.

stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you.
Kevin

Kevin,

This is David. How are you doing? Hope everything goes
well with you. How's Sun Devil going?

I still have not had any luck in job searching.
Hopefully, there's something coming up pretty soon.
I'll definitely update you regarding my situation.

All the best,

David Junus

I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.  Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.  

How do I get them comfortable?
Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?  If so, when?
Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?

Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.

it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around.

KevIn: 
What are you doing these days? I have been reading all the newspapers and watching CSpan, etc, keeping on the Story.  Are you ok with your position? 
Drop me an email when you can. Hope things turn around and Enron survives if it makes sense.

Don't forget.

FYI----Don't know what happened to my recommendation that they use either an 
unexecuted agreement notation or call the counterparty from the trading floor 
on a recorded line.

Re 1. I don't believe that the traders on 35 are appropriately covered based 
on what Dan has told me.  Is that a concern?  If so, it is possible to 
manually change the confirm to fit the situation for the mean time.

Re 3.  I understand what Mary is saying, but in these cases that I'm 
referring to (which I believe are rare), I believe the gas is flowing.  The 
meter has been turned on and isn't the pipeline accepting the gas?  We are 
still not nominating the gas, and because we have not put the ticket into the 
system, we are withholding payment.  Now, from what I understand, client 
services will make a manual payment, if they are called by the producer.  
But, for 1 month or even 2 months, we have not made a payment, because client 
services would not have known to make a payment, therefore, we are still in 
violation.  It appears the best solution legally, would be not to turn on the 
meter until the contract is signed.  I'm not sure that is a good business 
decission though.

I know that there are cases where we don't know that the meter is still 
flowing, or that it has been turned on.  I think the easiest thing would be 
to make sure that we are covered with a GTC spot, taking out the language of 
the recorded line.

Julie

   

Julie, 

In response to your concerns below:

1.  The traders on 35 are currently attempting to install a recorded line to 
be used when negotiating.

2.  The difficulty with putting in a contract as unexecuted is that Unify 
will not prevent the payment from going out the door.  I do not believe Unify 
Settlements drafts based on contract status, it drafts on any Sitara deal 
that replicated down, and Sitara reads unexecuted as a valid contract.  

3.  We have posed the possibility of entering the contract as unexecuted and 
enhancing Unify to hold payment as long as there was VP approval to hold 
payment, but Mary Cook said that this process would be in violation of the 
UCC based on the fact that we would partially perform (by accepting the gas 
via the nom/scheduling process).  With this partial performance, withholding 
the payment would not be appropriate under the law.  

Please let me know your thoughts after reviewing my comments.

Thank you, 
Melissa

While going through our confirmation process, there was some concern raised 
on deals that we are not confirming.  I'm sure you are aware of the concern 
that George W. had with not wanting a confirmation to go out to the producers 
when they were trying to get a firm contract signed.  I spoke with Dan Hyvl 
today and I wanted to relay to you his thoughts.

His first concern was if the Asset Traders were trading on a recorded phone 
lines.  Apparently the GTC's specify that if there is a dispute with what is 
on the confirmation, the recorded phone call would be the back up.  He said 
that if these calls are not recorded, then we should not be using the GTC's.  
In the case where the tickets are being held back until the contract is 
signed (example: a ticket was submitted today to start back in June), then we 
should be putting the contract in as unexecuted so the deal can be valued and 
tracked.  His decision on that issue was based on my memory that if a 
contract is marked unexecuted, Unify would not make payment.  If that is not 
the case, we could still put the contract and deal in the systems, and have a 
VP signed off that payment would not go out the door.

If deals are being done on an unrecorded phone line, Dan said that we would 
need to do something different if the payment is to go out the door.  Like 
for example, have the producer sign a one month contract.  Which I'm not sure 
you would want to do that.  Otherwise, he said that the trades should be sent 
down to 31 so they will be recorded.

I hope this makes sense.  Please call me, and let me know your thoughts.

Julie

Paul,
 You say 5,000/day plus fuel.  The delivery point is in the south texas 
pool.  Where does the fuel come in and how is it determined?  Also, did we 
ever determine the name of the Reliant Energy entity that was doing the deal?

	Paul Burgener@ENRON
	09/25/2000 04:45 PM
		 
Dan,

Attached are the details for the enovate transaction(s)/purchases of physical 
gas from Reliant @ Trunkline Stx pool.  I received your draft of the agreed 
Master for the 30,000/ day parcel.  Could you draft a form for the 5,000/day 
parcel winter only.  I need this turned around so I can forward to the 
Reliant people ASAP.  I also need to forward any changes to the agreement 
past our partners PEC legals folks.

Thanks,

If you have any questions please call me at (312) 541-1226

 

Please review to see if I have made all of the changes you discussed with 
them.  

Craig,
 I have added the FM language to the end of the 1st sentence in No. 1.  If 
okay, please forward to Ormet.  

Chris,
 Please review the attached to see if it covers your concerns.  If so, I will 
forward to Sean Breen for his review.

Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to
devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of
completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to
touch base with you and let you know that we probably will not be able to
address these contract issues until the week of Nov. 27th.

I hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.

Dan,

Please find below details of Phy Gas deals with GTC agreements:

Please review and comment.  Thank you.

Attached please find the modified Transaction Agreement which has been 
revised to reflect the matters you discussed earlier today.  I modified the 
third item relating to prior approval by Ormet of incremental costs to cover 
the situation that such transportation or supply becomes unavailable during 
the period Enron is obtaining Ormet's prior approval.   

Karen,
 I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time on.  
It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will continue 
to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing and I need 
to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as possible.  
If we need to put something in place before the contract is executed, maybe 
we can document the transaction under the existing GISB contract currently in 
place between the parties and agree that the transaction will be rolled up 
under the new master once the Master is executed.  

Forwarded for your information.  I recall talking with Gregg about this and 
that we did not intend to use the GISB for anything more than one month.  I 
think we agreed to let it sit.

Melissa,
 The maximum rate which HPL is authorized to impose for 311 transportation 
service may be established by either a rate proceeding before the FERC which 
would have to be renewed every 3 years or by using the margin component of a 
city gate rate which has been approved by the state regulatory agency.  In 
HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin 
component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas 
Railroad Commission.  This allows HPL to use this margin determined as 
provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its 
maximum rate for 311 service.  That is one of the reasons that HPL continues 
to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can 
probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have 
concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have 
such information.

 Please reforward your message to me after the 18th so that I can contact 
Aquila concerning where we next proceed concerning HPL's contract.

	mrgraves@aep.com
	06/08/2001 09:49 AM
		 
Dan,

Per our phone conversation, please contact Kathy Dirks with Aquila Energy
Marketing, Corporation regarding the final negotiations of their master
contract.  Per Kathy, this HPL contract has been in negotiations for almost
a year, and they are very close to finalizing.  Her phone number is:
816-527-1560.

Also, at yesterday's meeting regarding the various AEP Entities, you
mentioned that HPL has 311 Transportation with a Grandfathered Rate.  Do
you have any documentation regarding this arrangement, or can you refer me
to the person that could provide this?

Thank you,
Melissa Graves

Robin,
 At Jeff's request, I have reviewed the attached form which National Fuel 
provided.  It is not designed to operate as a Trading Contract.  Transactions 
are only formed by signing an Exhibit A to be prepared by National.  The 
Exhibit A is to have a Daily Transaction Quantity and National may nominate 
from 0 to 100% of that quantity each day.  Penalties only arise if the actual 
quantity deviates from their nominated quantity.  Seller to pay difference 
between Buyer's replacement price and the Gas Commodity Charge times the 
deficiency quantity.  Buyer to pay difference between the Gas Commodity 
Charge and the Daily Midpoint Price times the deficiency quantity.   Does not 
state what quantity is to be applied against the Gas Demand Charge; however, 
does state that if Seller has a force majeure the Gas Demand Charge is only 
applied against the actual volumes that Seller delivers and that the Gas 
Demand Charge is not reduced if Buyer declares a Force Majeure.  Buyer's 
payments are to be trued up to the actual quantities delivered should actuals 
deviate from the nominated quantities.  
 Please note the comments I provided to you last year relating to this 
counterparty.  All of those comments are applicable to this Contract form.  I 
have attached that memo for your review.

 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this matter.

Barbara,
 Tom Martin called and said it was his understanding that he could buy gas at 
any EOL point such as Exxon Katy, Waha or Carthage for any term and that he 
could resell such gas into HPL.  I explained to him that the EOL carve out 
was for transactions of less than one month.  He asked if you could call him 
if his understanding was incorrect and then he asked if you wouldn't mind 
just calling him to discuss the matter.  

Here is the draft as it was Wednesday.  The red-line is the changes to the 
version supplied by Southern dated June 1.

Please review the four which I have changed from Enron Company to Houston 
Pipe Line Company.  Call if you need anything further.  I intend to be over 
there next Monday.  

I sent it again.  Let Me know if you do not receive.

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.

For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words "OR
THE BILL OF SALE" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.

It is time to roll Smurfit for July.  Can you prepare the confirm and send it 
to me?

Thanks,

Attached please find a red-line of the changes for the referenced proposal.  
Please review and let me have your comments.  I had to start from scratch.   
I limited this to a single transaction as provided in the proposal.  You may 
recall that you had requested Debra to convert the single proposal into a 
Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement so that it could be utilized by adding 
future transactions by way of a Confirmation Letter.  The short review time 
to get something in place will not permit the global changes which may be 
necessary to cover all the points to make the proposal into a Master.

Dan-

I appreciate the effort you are making and I realize you, and everyone else,
have a lot on your plate.  However, Enron has had a general base contract
since mid-August and a draft Enron-specific contract since mid-September.
We are now 2 weeks from the contract start and you've indicated that a great
deal of work is still needed.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Karen,
     I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time
on.  It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will
continue to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing
and I need to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as
possible.  If we need to put something in place before the contract is
executed, maybe we can document the transaction under the existing GISB
contract currently in place between the parties and agree that the
transaction will be rolled up under the new master once the Master is
executed.

Lillian,
 Please put me down for the appreciation event.  Thank you.

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.

For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words "OR
THE BILL OF SALE" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.

Thanks

Greg,
 Please review my mark-up.  We need to keep the distinction between HPL and 
GM throughout the document.  Remember GM is the marketing affiliate and HPL 
is the pipeline.  Call me if you have any questions.

Candy,
 My initial reaction to the letter is that we should not commit to do a 
contract for deed for the buyer.  The buyer needs to obtain financing from 
another source and take us out completely; otherwise why are we doing it.  
Another buyer may come along during the interim.  Let's discuss this with Ann 
Elizabeth next week.

Blanca,
 I believe that you will need to get this form approved by the legal group in 
Columbus before it is signed.  It is my understanding that Pemex has agreed 
to New York law in the past.  I would not approve it unless they agreed to 
New York law and arbitration conducted in English.  If you need a quick 
turnaround, please check with Gary Prescott.

Dan,

Oglethorpe mentioned that they have sent the GISB back signed.  Did we 
receive it?

And how did you fare in all the rain.  I guess you went boating Saturday.

It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning 
and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less 
than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine 
Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at 
Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday 
afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were 
out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it 
started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way 
home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out 
yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James 
doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least 
they go through the motions.

 Please check with your counterparty at Reliant for the full name of the 
Reliant Energy entity.  Is it Reliant Energy Gas Resources Corp. or some 
other name?  I am still confused about the fuel component of the volume.  We 
probably need to expand on the language in the prior draft to specify the 
fuel volume for the movement of the gas from the Delivery Point to 
___________________.   Have the attached documents been sent to Reliant 
Energy and if so have we received any comments from them?  I will draft a 
Transaction Agreement for the latest deal that will be similar to the prior 
deal.

The company is Reliant Energy (wholesale trading group) at this point and the 
fuel is handled the same as the 30,000/d deal that you wrote up. (See 
attached) 

thanks, 

Ellen,
 I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each of the 
changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please review and if 
acceptable, please start the execution process by printing two originals of 
each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to me and I will have 
ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get Enovate to sign and return 
their contract and the two transaction agreements to me for forwarding one

A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her 
first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and 
begin eating a fine meal.

The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness 
and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. 
Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out 
a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof. 
Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked 
over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a 
rather stern voice, "Skippy!"

The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A 
couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, 
she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The 
father again looked and the dog and yelled, "Dammit Skippy!"

Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!" A few minutes later the woman 
had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let 
rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.

Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, "Dammit 
Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!"

Will this comply with your request?

It appears that it is time to do this again.  Thank you.

Kim,
 I have reviewed your markup of the redlined contract I forwarded to you last 
Wednesday.  Since you confirmed that we were merely putting into place a 
three month contract, we should be able to resolve the issues rather 
quickly.  If we were working on the Master, I would agree that we are a long 
way apart.  Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline.

 1. Delete the definition of "Credit Support Provider".
 2. Add definition as follows:  The term "Guarantor" means, as to Seller, 
Seller's ultimate parent, Enron Corp.
 3. Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as 
provided in my redline to you.  It is the position of our Credit Department 
that a rating of BBB- is considered investment grade and as such that is the 
benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered.  Enron 
Corp. is currently rates as BBB.
 4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The 
change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted.
 5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay. 
 6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and 
purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the 
Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to 
be handled between the party and its transporter. 
 7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10 
Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would 
mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a 
payment default.
 8. The change in 10.2 of "at or" should be restored.  This is a 3 month 
deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or 
after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal.
 9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There 
is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of 
the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's 
market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not 
be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should 
only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then 
it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate 
and collect a Termination Payment.
 10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would 
allow early termination other than a Triggering Event.  
 11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the 
notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone 
number or other address will be added.
 12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted 
and the original language provided in my previous redline should be 
restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and 
are not subject to negotiation by me.  
 13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the 
addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able 
to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods.  
Please reconsider.
 14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I

 Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me 
have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.

Dan-

Attached is a redline document showing our counter to your redline proposal.
The majority of your changes were fine, from my perspective, with minor
tweaking (for example, timelines in arbitration).  The two primary items I
think we will need to discuss are (1) Taxes and (2) the definition of a
Material Adverse Change.  Please see my suggestions and then we can discuss.
Please note that any changes we discuss will be subject to the final
approval of Wisconsin Public Service.

Please provide me with an estimated response time (ie, this afternoon,
tomorrow morning), so I can keep WPSC apprised.

Thanks for your help!

 You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you 
execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the 
information when I send them the contracts for their signature.    Dan

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.

Veronica,
 The credit language is only one of many areas of disagreement between the 
consultants view of what the contract should look like and our version.  
Their last response was that the MAC would be triggered if Enron Corp. fell 
below an A rating.  I informed them that we could not agree because it was my 
understanding that Enron Corp. was currently rated as BBB.  I will let you 
know if you need to be involved in the contract negotiation or 
non-negotiation in the future.  I do not currently have a response from the 
consultant as to our last position on her nonagreement to make the necessary 
changes so that we could agree to document the 3month deal.  

	Veronica Espinoza@ENRON
	12/01/2000 02:30 PM
		 
Dan,

I've looked through the contract (at least the credit terms).  Of course I 
prefer to keep our credit language w/ the mac language of ratings decline.  I 
am not too familiar w/ the transaction itself.  I simply feel that if it 
truly is just a 3 month transaction, we may not need to 1) argue this much 
further and add special language to a confirm 2) issue out a $10MM gty (or if 
we do make it valid for only the three month term as it ties to the contract 
itself)

Please let me know what you think.  The marketer and the counterparty contact 
on the deal have been calling me for a response.

Veronica

Veronica,

Attached is a redline version of the entire contract with Wisconsin Public
Service.  It includes all the changes requested by Dan Hyvl.  It has been
edited with my counter (i.e. - striking what not acceptable/relevant and
providing underlined substitute).

One thing I'd like you to consider in your review is the term and scope of
this contract.  The contract is for 12/00 - 2/01, 3 months, only.
Furthermore, the contract language covers just this transaction - it is NOT
the base document for future transactions.  I will begin work with Enron
early next year on a Master Contract to cover all future transactions.

With that in mind, I'd like to suggest that we remove any reference to a
Material Adverse Change.  It is currently a new and unsettling concept to
WPS, particularly their Credit Dept.  Given that (1) the contract is short
duration and (2) it is extremely unlikely that WPS will fall even to a BBB
ratings within this time period, I feel removal of this language would
greatly improve the chances of getting a meaningful contract in place
quickly (note today is the effective date).  I will work with WPS on this
concept for the future Master Contract.

I am leaving for lunch but will be back shortly.

Thanks for your help with this.

    THE LONG TERM CONTRACT IN WHICH WE DELIVER 10,000 BBLS\DAY OF E\P MIX

     TO WESTLAKE PETROCHEMICAL  WAS CANCELLED EFFECTIVE 12/31/2000 PER

     MUTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN WESTLAKE AND ENRON. 

     FOR THE LAST 4 - 5 MONTHS WESTLAKE HAS BEEN SHORT PAYING THE INVOICES

     IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.0025, WHICH IS THE PREMIUM ON THE CONTRACT. THEY SAY

     THEY DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY IT ANYMORE SO THEY DON'T.

     DO WE HAVE ANY RECOURSE TO COLLECT THIS SHORTFALL?

     OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WESTLAKE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRAINED AT BEST.

     WOULD THERE BE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS IF I JUST WITHHELD PRODUCT FOR 

     DECEMBER, WHICH IS THE LAST DELIVERY MONTH ANYWAY.

 I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement and 
have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best efforts" 
which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read "commercially 
reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the same throughout the 
document where we use the term "commercially reasonable best efforts".  With 
this change, please print out two copies of the contract and two copies of

Please Review.  

Please see item 8 of the attached GTC.  When the outside party does not 
provide the Gas from an alternate source or fails to take the Gas to an 
alternate market, such event is a default allowing us to collect damages for 
non-performance.  No different than any of our standard Enfolio contracts.

Hi Stacy -

Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline 
location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing 
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.

Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the 
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting 
?ready for his annual trip...but there were 
?problems everywhere. 

?Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves 
?did not produce the toys as fast as the regular 
?ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure 
?of being behind schedule. 

?Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming 
?to visit. This stressed Santa even more. 

?When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that 
?three of them were about to give birth and two had 
?jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. 
?More Stress. 

?Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the 
?boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground 
?and scattered the toys. 

?Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for 
?a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went 
?to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit the 
?liquor and there was nothing to drink. 

?In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot 
?and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all 
over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom 
?and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made 
?from. 

?Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed 
?on his way to the door. He opened the door and 
?there was a little angel with a great big 
?Christmas tree. The angel said: "Where would you 
?like to put this tree fat man?" 

And that my friend, is how the little angel came 
?to be on top of the Christmas tree

 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist

superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an 
accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.

Why is this necessary when we just executed a reduced price fuel supply 
contract with PQP LLC and we are in the process of trying to sell the asset 
and transfer the fuel contract to the new buyer and Glencore?

Doug:

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a 
call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it 
to the lenders for their review and approval.

many thanks

Kim,
 I am reviewing the changes you made to see if they conform to our 
discussion.  I understand from your comments in the email that you disagree 
with the items we discussed and are attempting to go back to the previous 
language which I indicated would be unacceptable.  As such, I have gone back 
over the redlined contract and have only commented on the things that differ 
from our previous agreement.  Please review these and call me in the morning 
if you feel that your client cannot agree to these changes.  
1. The sentence added at the end of 9.1 should be deleted.  Any differences 
between the DCQ and actual is to be handled between the party and its 
transporter.  As I explained, if we schedule a DCQ of 10,000 with you and the 
pipeline and only deliver 9,500 to the pipeline, the pipeline will deliver 
10,000 to you and collect the 500 shortfall from us.  Likewise, if we 
schedule 10,000 with you and the pipeline and you only take 9,500, we still 
sell you the 10,000 and the 500 you didn't take is between you and your 
pipeline transporter.
2. 10.3 and 10.4 need to be deleted.  What we agree to say was as follows:
  "10.3  Buyer represents that no taxes are applicable at the Point of Sale.  
In the event such representation is false, then such misrepresentation shall 
be a Triggering Event allowing Seller to terminate the Contract pursuant to 
Section 17.1."
3. Delete the language "not otherwise due to an event of force majeure" that 
you added in the 2nd and 8th lines of 12.3.  
4. Delete the language added at the end of 12.5 and add language after the 
word "expired" at the end of the second sentence.  "In no event shall any 
event of force majeure extend for a period in excess of 10 days during the 
term of this Contract.  After such 10 day period, the parties shall be 
obligated to resume performance as if the event of force majeure had been 
remedied, and if such party does not resume performance, such nonperformance 
shall be deemed a Triggering Event allowing the other party to terminate 
pursuant to Section 17.1."
5. Delete item (vii) added in 17.2 because it is adequately covered by my 
inserted language in 12.5.
6. The $15,000,000 changed in the 3rd line of 17.4 needs to be changed back 
to $10,000,000.  If the exposure exceeds $10,000,000, that is the reason 
additional security would be required.  This contract contemplates that 
Seller has to provide security for any exposure in excess of $0 whereas the 
Buyer only has to provide security for exposure in excess of $10,000,000.  
Not a very balanced obligation because the Seller is bearing all risk of 
payment after it makes deliveries under the contract.

	"Kim Decell" <kdecell@gassupplyconsulting.com>
	12/07/2000 11:51 AM
		 
Dan,

Attached is a redline document which compares our current version to your
11/22 version.  I have summarized our differences below, but I will call you
at about 10:30, subject to your calendar, to discuss the items.

Significant Differences
(1) Taxes
 I deleted Enron reference to Buyer paying taxes AT the Point of Sale.  I
(a) kept our 10.3 but added sentence that "no taxes currently applicable at
POS and (b) added Sec 10.4, which we discussed gives either Party right to
terminate contract if they are assessed an unduly burdensome tax.

(2) Exceptions to Force Majeure
 I added "not otherwise due to an event of force majeure" to the section
addressing failure of reserves/insufficient production from reserves.  This
should clarify that if a force majeure event, ie explosion, occurred at
Seller's supply point, Seller would NOT be obligated to perform (except as
identified in Triggering Events).

(3) Billing
 We cannot accept Enron's requested changes.  It is the industry-standard to
bill Buyer's based on what WAS, not what was TO BE, delivered.  If actuals
are not available, it is acceptable to bill based on DCQ, but once actuals
are available, prior period adjustments would be made to the next invoice.
 To demand a procedure different than the accepted industry-standard is
something that should have been stipulated by Enron at the time the Contract
Terms were established in 8/00.
 Given the tremendous progress we've made to this point, I am hopeful that
Enron will accept the industry-standard (billing on actuals) for this
contract.  We can address this issue next month when we begin preparation of
the future Enron/WPS Master Contract.

(4) Credit Terms
 Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed Enron's Material Adverse Change
definition, (b) removed Enron's Sec 17.2(vii) regarded MAC and (c) added
back our Section 16.10 Credit Terms, whereby either Party has the right to
demand credit support if in their sole and non-discriminatory assessment the
other Party might not be able to meet its financial obligations pursuant to
the Contract.  Failure to provide credit support is considered a Triggering
Event per Enron's language.

(5) Effect of Force Majeure
 Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed language referring to
consequences of extended force majeure but revised to refer to Sec 17.2
Triggering Events and (b) added Sec 17.2 (vii) to make extended FM a
Triggering Event.

(6) Collateral Requirement
 THIS IS A NEW REQUEST.  I would like to change the Termination Payment
threshold from $10MM to $15MM.  In light of soaring gas prices, WPS could
find itself owing more than $10MM strictly based on standard,
full-performance Accounts Receivable (for example:  15,000 (MDQ) * $10 (gas
price) * 60 (days) = $9MM.)  I believe your provision was intended to keep
Buyer's from having multi-month A/R and/or non-performance charges.
 Since I believe we agree WPS is fully capable of meeting its financial
obligations, we should not set a threshold below potential standard,
full-performance A/R.

MINOR ITEMS
(1) Throughout document, I made changes to your comments to make consistent
with form of entire document, including changing Daily Contract Quantity to
DCQ and putting days in words (ie 20 days became twenty (20) days).
(2) Deleted Nominated Quantity definition as this term was replaced by DCQ.
(3) Other changes that we agreed to yesterday.

Dan, please let me know the earliest, convenient time for you to discuss
these items with me on the phone.

Thanks for your help.

Dave,
 I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable 
to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and 
contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find 
some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major 
concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form 
that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA 
is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and 
as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under 
Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of 
fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items 
under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B.  
Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales 
obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio 
Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default 
by either.  
 Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some 
agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any 
transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term 
of our sales transaction with them.  
 Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract.

Phil,
 Please review the attached and let me know what other changes need to be 
made.  I have added a sentence in Other of each to provide for the Force 
Majeure Language to be attached as Exhibit A.  Please let me know if you 
think this will work.
I will be out Monday, but in early Tuesday.  Please call my assistant to set 
up an appointment for Early Tuesday.

Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the "Notices" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,

 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse 
requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm 
desk using a standard    GTC confirm.

Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality 
agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments.

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.

Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Mike,
 I have checked with the credit group and the suggested changes to the 
confidentiality agreement and to Exhibit "C" and "D" are acceptable.  They 
did point out a typo in the collateral threshold provision.  It should read 
$1,500,000 instead of $1,5000,000.  Please accept the redlined changes to the 
documents and make the above correction and the documents should be ready for 
you to start the execution process.  I am informed that credit will not make 
any changes of the $1,500,000 collateral threshold amount until they have had 
an opportunity to review the Ormet financial information.  Thereafter we can 
work on an amendment if they feel that the financial information warrants 
making a change.

Please read 5&6 plus appendix

Contract changed as requested.  I have had Jenny print 2 contracts and 2 
transaction agreements for you.

Doug,
 As we discussed, Larry Pardue has requested that I get you to sign an 
officer's certificate regarding the execution and delivery of the Fuel Supply 
Agreements.  The document that he forwarded to me does not define the 
agreements that he wants you to certify as to.  They are vaguely referred to 
as Transaction Agreements which have been delivered.  As far as I know, he 
may be wanting a certification as to the Consent documents.  If they get back 
to me, I will request that they modify the document to reflect the Fuel 
Supply Agreements only and that you are not aware of any reason why they 
would not be valid under New York law, that you are not aware of any lawsuit 
threatened against EPOS as a result of it entering into these Fuel Supply 
Agreements and that so far as you know, EPOS is not an investment company as 
such term is defined.  I will let you know what Larry is able to modify.
	Larry Pardue@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	12/14/2000 08:38 AM
		 
Dan, as we discussed, herewith the EPOS Officer's Certificate.  Again, and 
sorry for the short notice, we need a fax of the Certificate before 11 a.m. 
this morning, Houston, time, for the closing/funding.  Again, the certificate 
is being requested from our lawyers, Vinson & Elkins, so that they may 
release their opinion in connection with the closing.  They must have the 
Certificate in order to do so.

Thanks Dan, and please call me at 202 628 1700, or my cell 713 854 8000, or

Counties won by Gore: 677 
Counties won by Bush:  2,434 

Pop. of counties won by Gore: 127 million 
Pop. of counties won  by Bush: 143 million 

Sq miles of country won by Gore: 580,000 
Sq  miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000 

Now Professor Joseph Olson  of the Hamline University School of Law in
St. 
Paul Minnesota has  produced another interesting new statistic. Professor

Olson looked up the  crime statistics for all of these counties and came
up 
with this:  

Avg Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2 
Avg  Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush: 2.1 

Now, what area  of this country do you want electing the President of the

United States,  Gore's or Bush's?

Kim,
 I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing 
the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I 
finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron 
Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you 
know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contact 
for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been 
signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be. 
 If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution 
which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC.  
 Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy 
should be sufficient. Don't you agree.

Jeff,
 I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the 
meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.  
She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete 
it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken 
out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the 
meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did 
not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use 
the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of 
paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future 
undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that 
was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of 
default.  
 If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to 
leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his 
representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.

we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a

portion out of the contract.

Christian,
 I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th is 
not a 
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day is 
a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are open 
for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it is not 
a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of Business Day.  
Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Christian,
     Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.

I haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I know 
Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus

	12/05/2000 02:53 PM
		 
Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

 Please review the language in 87crfm.  Call me after you have had a chance 
to read.  If okay, I will print on letterhead so that it can be resent to the 
counterparty.

Dave,
 I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable 
to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and 
contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find 
some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major 
concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form 
that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA 
is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and 
as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under 
Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of 
fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items 
under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B.  
Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales 
obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio 
Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default 
by either.  
 Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some 
agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any 
transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term 
of our sales transaction with them.  
 Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract.

Thanks for all your help and have a good holiday.

I was informed of a situation where Ameripol was receiving liquids in our 
gas.  They claim they suffered losses of $180,000 in equipment and product 
damage.  They are asking for reimbursement.  Please let me know what happened 
Gary and Dan what damages they could collect.
Thanks,

please review their form of a gty in order for us to receive executed copies.

Dan and Craig,

Can you please take a look at Tenaska's incoming gty format, as their 
guarantor has changed and subsequently new gty's need to be issued for both 
ENA and ECC.  As the current gty's expire at the end of the month, it is 
imperative that we give Tenaska feedback as soon as we are able to in order 
to have the gty's executed on their end.  The gty format is attached in the 
email below.

Thanks again for your prompt attention,

Veronica Espinoza

Veronica,
As we discussed on Friday below is our form guaranty.  Please review and get 
back to me with any comments.  I also am sending over a confidentiality 
agreement via fax.

Here is another incident stemming from the A-S 30 inch pipeline rupture of 
December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this 
customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, 
HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different 
source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line 
or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a 
failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim 
caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the 
quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more 
than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor.
Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages.  
Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a 
result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.  They have 
faxed us a written demand or notification which I will forward as soon as I 
receive it.

Leslie,
 I have reviewed the product descriptions for the natural gas products on 
Dynegydirect and they appear to be standard descriptions which should be 
easily understood by our traders.  As such, I am comfortable with such 
descriptions.

Please notify both me and Sheri Thomas via e-mail as soon as you are

Thank you so much.  Have a happy holiday.

Ellen,
 Is this what you are talking about.  If so, I prepared this amendment so 
that we could get out of a bad trading position.  The customer had the right 
to use first of the month pricing on volume swings.  I believe that Lee 
Papayoti did the deal.  Gary Chapman with Union Carbide indicated that the 
deal is done, however, we are waiting on signatures.

Russell,
 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

	
	                           
	

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Regards,
Russell

  This draft has not been sent due to pending guaranty issues.  The attached 
has guaranties for The Coastal Corporation and Enron Corp.  for 20mm / 30 mm 
( per your change) and are specific to this agreement.  Dan has advised the 
guaranties are written for the agreement and we cannot change to include 
other Enron Companies.  You will need to contact  Enron Corp. for a guaranty

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Christian,
     Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.
Please print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the
purchase order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If
the number is not available, them please delete the information requiring
the number from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed
copies to me or Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Christian,
     If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
your address for Invoices.

Christian,
 I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great 
holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to 
changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please 
make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where 
10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to 
	"Pfister, Christian W." <CWPfister@cps-satx.com>

Mr. Hyvl,

Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to
see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit?
(see message below)

I agree.  The Accounting Dept. informed me that there are two days that
sometimes land on the 25th that CPS considers a holiday.  One is the day
after Thanksgiving and the other is during Fiesta for the Battle of Flowers
Parade.  I requested that they just pay a day early if the 25th lands on one
of these CPS holidays.

I have one more request, however.  In 4.5. Collateral
Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold, could you raise the threshold of
$10 million for a Letter of Credit to $15 or $20 million (whatever you feel
comforable with)?

Christian,
     I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th
is not a
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day
is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are
open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it
is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of
Business Day.  Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you
agree?

On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  

I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.

 This appears a little too iffy.  Please get with SCGC to find out the notice

Russell,
 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.

Dan,
Did we ever send a contract out ot these guys?  I know we discussed it but I 
bet I never requested a contract.  Let me know.

Anne,
 I have incorporated the changes you requested in the above confirmations.  
We deleted the language "and Enron confirms the nomination" in the third 
paragraph of OTHER in the Spot Confirm and replaced it with "and Enron 
receives the notification of the nomination at least 30 minutes prior to the 
1st GISB nomination cycle deadline,".  
 If these are in order, please print 2 originals of each, have them signed, 
and forward them to Grand Oh at the Calgary office for his follow-up so that 
they can be executed by Enron.  
 Please do not hesitate to call if you have any further questions.

Please generate master for my review.  Thank you.

Dan & Debra -

Attached is a credit worksheet for a Master Firm Purchase/Sale for UGI 
Utilities.  Please prepare a draft and send to Claire Neri at UGI at your 
earliest convenience.  

Thanks,

Jay Williams

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Cindy, Thanks for your help. - Claire

Help, Time Warner is my cable service provider, however, when I attempted to 
open the ordering information, I am told that a discount for TimeWarner cable 
modern service is not available in my area.  What do I need to do?  So far as 
I know, I can subscribe to cable modem service with TimeWarner, however, I 
have been waiting until the ClickAtHome rollout before I committed to any 
service contract.  Can someone get back to me regarding when the discounted 
service might be available, if not, what is the possibility for a discounted 
DSL service from ATT.  Thank you.

Bridgette,
 To the best of my knowledge, we are not working on a contract with 
Washington Energy.  Has anyone asked the gas trader assigned to that account 
about any contract drafts that the gas trader may have received and not 
forwarded to legal.  

	Bridgette Anderson@ENRON
	01/11/2001 09:39 AM
		
Jeanne,

As I explained to Terry on Monday or Tuesday, according to the notes within 
Global Contracts database, K#96030149 is an unexecuted contract and it 
currently has a status of expired .  Because of these factors, we suggested 
that the deal be re-entered and a GTC attached to it until a contract can be 
negotiated and executed.  

Unfortunately Global Contracts database is inoperative this morning so I 
cannot give you any further information regarding any other notes for that 
particular K#.  Please let me know if the suggestion that has been made is 
feasible. 

Dan- to the best of your knowledge, has there or will there be a contract 
drafted for Washington Energy?

Regards,
Bridgette

Jeanne Wukasch
01/11/2001 08:53 AM
Bridgette  -    Please extend global contract #96030149  with Washington 
Energy.    This deal should be set up as a month-to-month evergreen (see note 
below from the trader - John Singer.)

Thanks.

Extend the deal as a month to month ( that would be the default of the 
assigned CES contract).  Price is 100% CGas Appalachian Index (no fixed 
price).  Gathering stays the same.

John - I am trying to cover to Terry who is out of the office for the rest of 
the week.      I am working on some issue with Gloria and I need your help on 
one:

The deal ticket (#226330)  for Washington Energy Company for purchases from 
meters 602368 and 602467 on CGAS was only set up through 10/31/00.    It had 
a fixed price of $2.91  with a gathering deduct of ($0.27).          Is ENA 
still purchasing this gas in November ?   What is the pricing structure 
?      I was reluctant to have Global contracts extend the existing contract 
with the fixed price without your approval.

Please let me know via email what the terms of this purchase deal should be 
going forward.

If you need to call me,  I am still working from home   281-286-7153     ( I 
will be gone from about 9:30 - 1:00 on Thursday for physical therapy)

So you only email me when you want something.  No, I do not know what I am 
going to do.  They tell me Time Warner Cable Modem service is not available 
in my area, however, Time Warner tells me it is.  They tell me that I can 
sign up for DSL and expense it on my expense account until they allow it 
sometimes next month.  I guess I need to talk with them some more about which 
is better.  People tell me the cable modem service is actually faster than 
the response we currently have in the office.  Let me know what you decide to 
do, so that I can ponder the reasons for your choice.

Clement,
 Russell Diamond of the Enron Credit group would like Enron to issue to 
Engage (now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.) a blanket guarantee 
covering obligations of ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. without necessarily tying those obligations to specific 
contracts.  Do you have a form of guaranty that could be used for this.  I 
think that the guaranty would still have a limit ($25MM)?.  Please advise.
	Dan J Hyvl
	10/13/2000 11:35 AM
		
Russell,
 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

	Russell Diamond
	10/13/2000 10:57 AM
		
Dan,

I provided all the information that you are asking for on the original credit 
worksheet I e-mailed to ENA legal on August 29.  You will notice in the 
comments section the Enron entities I wanted covered in the guaranty along 
with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the 
specific contracts that need to be covered they can be obtained through the 
documentation group, or through 'Live Link' on our computers.  Please make 
note of the name change that has now occurred with respect to Engage.

Russell,
 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

	
	                           
	

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Regards,
Russell

( per your change) and are specific to this agreement.  Dan has advised the 
guaranties are written for the agreement and we cannot change to include

Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated to all 
parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be used.  The 
red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been requesting.  By copy 
I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested changes and to 
communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.  If she notifies 
you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2 originals of the clean 
document and have it signed by CPS and forward to Janet for signature by 
ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any questions.   My phone number is

you so that you could give it to her.  She said that she would send it to the 
city for its review.  The draft contains certain blanks which the city's

Troy,
 Please review the attached to see if it conforms with your agreement. If it 
does, please forward it to National.  Call me if you have any further 
questions.

Russell,
 Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are 
covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the the 
guarantee, incoming or outgoing.  
 Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron 
entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company 
will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's 
new parent will need to take its place.  
 Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will 
not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this 
takes the action of their spun off entity.

Clement,
 Do you agree?

	Russell Diamond

Clement, Dan,

Please give me an update on this guaranty.

Clement, Dan,

Below is an e-mail from my counterpart at Coastal with comments to the 
revised Enron Corp draft that Clement provided to me in his e-mail on Dec.. 
21st.  Can each of you please review these concerns.  If the Master will not 
be executed until after their merger with El Paso, I think it is OK to accept 
a Unified guaranty cap instead of specifif limits.  I was origninally thought 
the reason for the specific dollar limits was because of Contracts.

Thanks
Russell

Kiran.Parthasarathy@CMenergy.com on 01/04/2001 01:46:03 PM
Russell, 

We looked at the revised redline on the Enron physical business sent by you 
on Dec 21st 00. 

We have the following important comments: 

(1) The first page of the Guaranty refers to specific Contracts that will be 
covered by the Guaranty and one identified Contract is the Enfolio Master 
Firm Purchase/ Sale Agreement.? As you are aware, this Contract has not been 
signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not 
probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.? Therefore 
we request that the Guaranty language be broadened to include all Obligations 
of the Enron entities to CME (and not be Contract specific).

(2)The third page of the Guaranty discusses Maximum Limit (Section 2) and 
sets specific numerical caps for each of the covered Enron entities.? We had 
requested for a unified Cap earlier and once again request that a unified Cap 
be set for all entities.? 

(3)The fifth page of the Guaranty (Section 9), says that this Guaranty will 
supersede the Old Guaranty that was issued jointly to Engage US and Engage 
Canada.? As you are aware, we are not affiliated or connected with Engage 
Canada and therefore cannot bind Engage Canada whatsoever in the proposed 
Guaranty.? That was the rationale for our insert in that paragraph ("insofar 
as it respects Contract Party").? This was deleted in your revised redline.

We are anxious to complete this Guaranty as soon as possible.? We suggest, if 
it is necessary, a conference call involving ourselves and our Counsel.

Please respond at your earliest convenience. 

Thanks 
Kiran 

Kiran, 

Please see attached comments from our legal group.? If there are any 
additional concerns regarding the comments please contact Clement Abrams- 
713-853-5986.

you need to sign first.  Otherwise if they are signing first, forward the 
above document to them, have them print it, sign it and forward it to ENA for 
ENA's signature.

Kyle,
 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company

Dan,

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

This is in follow-up to the deal transfer matter we discussed this morning.

Julie Meyers called me and stated that Tom Martin had called her to put the 
deal transfer from HPL to ENA on hold till Monday; however, she had already 
moved them in the system.  I asked her to find out if the deals had been 
confirmed under HPL and if so, I would need to prepare a document to transfer 
them from HPL to ENA.  She agreed to send me a list of the deals that had 
been moved and whether or not they had been documented with the 
counterparty.  Apparently, they had been and Jennifer Blay has now 
redocumented two of the deals as ENA deals.

Attached are the confirmations that went out under HPLC.  Jennifer has 
reconfirmed Forest Oil under ENA already.  I will followup with you Monday 
after Tom meets with legal.

,,,,

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thanks!!

Julie

	
	

confirms have been sent under HPLC

Julie Meyers

Apparently there is some concern of these deals being moved.  Dan Hyvl would 
like to know if the following deals have been confirmed already under HPLC.

Duke Energy - Q04182
Duke Energy - NZ7880
Western Gas Resources - Q10831
Duke Energy - Q04119
Forest Oil Corp -  Q22828

If they have let me know.  I need to send something to Dan and some others.

Thanks!!

Julie'

Ellen,
 I am forwarding this to you for your information.  Gary Lamphier is sending 
to the counterparty and I will forward a signed copy once Gary gets it back.

Please review and give me your comments.  I have talked with Brant Reves and 
he said he is not requiring any credit provisions to be in place up front of 
this deal.  Note that the GTC gives us the option to request credit support 
during the term of the deal.  

Dave,
 Please call me if you have any questions.  Remember that the Transaction 
Agreement is only to be done if and when they sign the Master Agreement.

Janet,
 I have reviewed the attached contract and it gives me a lot of concern.  
First brush, it is one sided in their favor and offers us no breakage 
protection.  Specifically, 
 Section 4.4 --- HPL should be the confirming party.
 Section 4.5 --- HPl also needs to have the right to call for security.  
Clause should be balanced.
 Section 5.5a -- "its best efforts" should be changed to "commercially 
reasonable efforts".
 Sections 5.8 & 5.9 --  Need clauses addressing "undertakes by Buyer" and 
"overtakes by Buyer".  
 Section 6.3b --  20 days should be changed to 15 days in each location in 
this section.
 Section 6.4 ---  Needs a lot of explanation.  Why is it here?  Why would we 
agree to such?
 Article 10 - Force Majeure -  Need to add Enron language as to items which 
are not force majeure.
 Article 11 - Default -  Need to add additional Triggering Events, Early 
Termination, and Termination Damage provisions.
 Also, need to add provisions for limitation of liability and waiver of 
consequential damages.

 Let me know how you would like to proceed.  I do not think that they will 
agree to make any of the changes we would need to do the deal.  Would they be 
willing to contract using the GISB form of agreement?

	Janet H Wallis
	01/04/2001 11:20 AM
		 
See attached contract below.  Ignore 4.1 and 4.2, those will have to be 
changed.  Also, keep an eye
out in 4.4 - the default language for confirmations; 10.2 - the Force Majeure 
language; 18.2 - 3 rd party beneficiary; and 10.4 - transportion is not (?) 
subject
to force Majeure?

Thanks,
J

Janet,

Attached is our "standard" gas enabling agreement that we plan to use with
Enron.  It is the same agreement we put in place last year when Enron did
not submit a bid.

If you will provide proper corporate / address information for Enron we will
generate an original contract.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Susan,
 I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have 
attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize 
the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a 
majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me 
you comments as to the suggested changes. 

   

Ellen,
 Attached please find a copy of the Transaction Agreement dated September 13, 
2000 (2000-64crfm) and the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement dated 
effective September 1, 1999 which was signed by ENA and AGC (99017actr).

 I can send you hard copies if you need.

Cyndie,
 Can you confirm that you have a copy of the executed Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement?

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.

       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

 Spoke with credit and they are permitting us to go forward without adding 
credit provisions.  In reviewing your email, are both of the existing deals 
being modified for the period Feb  through July.  your chart says half for

These are the Reliant Energy - Entex transactions which need to be signed by 
Entex and ENA.  All other tickets have either been previously documented or 
cancelled by other deal tickets.
  

The below list is all of the Entex Gas Resources Corp. transactions which 
have been done by Janet which have not been signed.

These are all of the outstanding deal ticket confirmations according to 
Janet.  Please call if you need any further documentation.

Christian,
 I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached contract 
document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended that the 
Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on any invoice 
that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way that we have 
to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.  Therefore, i have 
not removed that line from the address,  At such time as the Purchase Order 
Number is available, please send a revised address notice to the company 
containing such number.  Until that happens, it will be understood that no 
number has been provided.  Please call if you have any questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Ellen,
 The enovate office in Chicago tells me that the addresses in the Contract 
are correct as written and that they have gotten with the people in Houston 
to get them to leave the addresses as contained in the contract.  Regarding 
the Financially Firm language, I would suggest that you line through the word 
Financially in each case where it occurs in the contract, line through the 
entire definition of Financially Firm and have the person who signs for 
Reliant initial each of the line outs.   I do not feel that we need to define 
the term Firm.  Our view of the contract is that the obligations are always 
firm so no further clarification is needed.  Do you concur?  If so, forward 
the signed and initialled contracts together with the signed Transaction 
Agreements and I will have the enovate officer also initial the line outs and 
return a final fully executed contract to you.

Christian,
 I have included the Red-line language in the contract relating to 
utilization of small business concerns.  Hopefully, the next thing I see is 2 
originals which have been signed by CPS.  

Dave,
 Please review both of the attached carefully.  I dated them Friday in case 
they are okay, please use them.  If you need any changes, I will be in 
Friday.

Attached please find a revised Enfolio Contract with CPS.  The changes 
incorporated in the attached contract are:
1)  "City Public Service (San Antonio)" has been changed to "The City of San 
Antonio, acting through City Public Service Board".
2)  The effective date has been changed to "October 1, 2000.
3)  The changes requested in items 1 and 2 of the addendum have been 
incorporated.
4) The Utilization of Small Business Concerns language has been added as the 
last item in Appendix "1", and
5)  An additional representation has been added at the end of the 
Representations and Warranties in Appendix "1" relating to the necessary 
authorizations with respect to the execution, delivery and performance by 
Customer of  this Agreement.

If these changes are acceptable please advise and we will forward two 
original copies for execution.  

I believe the first 2 are revisions and the 3rd one is new to you.

are moving the existing deals to?  Has one been assigned to HPL?

Debra & Dan,

We currently have two Master Purchase Sale Firm contracts with Reliant Energy 
Services, Inc.  The new master (96055225) is being used for all firm trading 
(including EOL), and the old master (96001135) needs to be terminated.  I 
have spoken with the counterparty about moving certain long term deals 
currently riding on the old contract over to the new contract (re-confirming 
as required), and they are agreeable.  There are 10 Nov-Mar deals also riding 
on the old master.  The terms of the old master require only 30 days written 
notice to terminate, but I would like to send a notice of termination to be 
effective on the date those ten deals expire (March 31).

I've attached the contract for review.  Does legal draft a letter, or do I?  
Please let me know how to proceed.

Thanks,
Susan

Craig,
 Attached please find a revised draft of the Ormet Contract.  I have 
incorporated the language from the Credit Worksheet prepared by Jason 
Williams.  That language is included in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Contract 
and in the definitions for Material Adverse Change, Guarantor, Funded Debt, 
Current Ratio, and Net Worth.  
 Regarding Amy Baird's memo, I have made the requested changes in Article 3 
of the Contract regarding changing "Schedule" and "Scheduled" to "deliver" 
and "delivered" and "receive" and "received".  I did not add the language 
requested in (iii) because that language is already included in the 
definition of "Replacement Price Differential".  I included the language she 
requested under (iv) as (iii) in Section 3.2  I omitted the last sentence 
relating to consequential damages of $1,000,000 per occurrence as we 
discussed and left in the language in Section 8.3 which limits the 
consequential damages to a maximum of $1,000,000 during the term of the 
Agreement.  Likewise, I did not delete the language from Section 8.3 
providing that the gas is being supplied solely on the express 
representations and warranties provided in the Agreement and that all other 
warranties are being waived.  I did delete the language relating to Texas law 
and sentence starting with "Therefore, the Parties agree that (i) three" 
because we had agreed to delete the language from Section 4.1 which set forth 
the method of determining a party's liquidated damages.
I added a sentence at the end of Section 8.5 relating to trial before the 
court with waiver of right to jury trial.  I deleted the language relating to 
arbitration in Appendix 1.  
As we discussed, I did not make the change to force majeure.  We need to 
discuss this.  Our obligation should be limited to having firm transportation 
on one of the pipelines with interruptible transportation on the other.  If 
the firm transportation is interrupted because of force majeure, our 
obligation should be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to 
cause the volumes to be delivered via the other pipeline if there was 
available capacity on such other pipeline.  
 Please review the contract and if you agree that it represents your 
understanding, you may forward it to the folks at Ormet.  I will be out of 
the office on Monday, but will be available by phone.  

Linda,
 I am looking for the follow-up assignment.  I remember having it prepared 
and signed when the AEP people were looking at the contracts across the 
street.  The reason it was assigned back to ENA was that it needed to reside 
in ENA through July 1999.  Thereafter it could be assigned to HPL.  If I 
don't find the copy, everything got scuffled in the move, I will reassign 
effective as of August 1, 1999.  Is this acceptable?

	Linda S Bryan

Dan,

This contract was assigned to HPLC effective 5/1/00 and reassigned to ENA on 
the same date.  The reassignment included a note from you dated 5/23/00 
stating  "the Union Carbide contract has been assigned in error and is 
reassigned to ENA because that contract was included in one of the prior ECT 
monetizations".  This contract is included on the Exhibit A of the assignment 
back to ENA.

 Is there another assignment reassigning the contract back to HPLC from ENA?

Please adivse.

Thanks,

Linda

   
	
	

An issue has come to light regarding this contract.  HPL has received an 
amendment to contract 96002201 between HPL and Union wherein it refers to an 
assignment between EING and HPL.   Our clerk, Cathy Harris, spoke to Dan Hyvl 
concerning the Enron entity name discrepancy and obtained a copy of the 
assignment effective 5/1/00 which includes Union Carbide as a contract to be 
assigned.  The contract was evidently not assigned on the 5/1/00 date.  
Please have someone in your group make this correction and let me know when 
the correction is completed so that we can process the amendment timely.

I think that the reassignment should be August 1, 2000 instead of August 1, 
1999, however, I will confirm once I find the executed assignment.  Am still 
looking.

I plan to be out as much as I can; I will be out for two non consective days 
of vacation during February, I just don't know what days yet. In other words, 
I have not been told.  I will tell you as soon as I'm told.  

John, 
 You know the answer.  Can you call the central desk for the price for spot 
gas to be sold to Heartland.  I spoke with Sylvia Pollan and she was to get 
back to me.

Charles,
 Can you redo the statement for physical gas through the 23rd and include a 
line item for the Mark-to-market true-up value as a result of the termination 
triggered by their bankruptcy filing.  Jason R Williams of the Credit group 
was to redo the termination payment amount.

	John Enerson
	01/30/2001 10:36 AM
		 
Dan - can we apply this amount to prepetition gas.  Unfortunately, I do not 
think we can?  Please advise.
	
	

John,  FYI - Heartland made a $63,000 payment yesterday.  The total credit 
for them now is $308,940.12.

The November 2000 contract is the new deal with reliant.  We need to verify 
that we have a master between HPL and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  If not, 
the old contract needs to be assigned to HPL.  Certain deals that were shown 
to the purchaser of HPL included business being done with Reliant Energy 
Services, Inc.  That means that if we don't have an HPL master, we need to do 
one for them.  Two deals were shown as HPL, however, they may have been GTCs, 
if so, we would need to create a master, and if the old master still exists, 
i would like to assign it to HPL so that they would have a contract to use 
after July.  Call me if you have any questions.

Troy I assume that Enron has a standard confidentiality agreement and if you
would E-mail a copy to me I will try to get it in place so that we can begin
sharing information.

Larry,

Thank you to you and your team for allowing us the opportunity to come and
present.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, my attempt to
track down information on Enron and an ammonia forward market has not as of
yet yielded results (I will continue to investigate).

Pursuant to the decision to focus initially financial hedging, risk
management strategies, and to understand Mississippi Chemical's risk
appetite and hedging objectives,  I offer the following questions:

1.  Historically, what percentage of your natural gas consumption have you
hedged?  Are your required to have a specific percentage of your exposure
hedged, with hedge levels depending differing time horizons?
2.  What policies/procedures govern what you can and cannot do with respect
to hedging instruments?
3.  What is Mississippi Chemical's position on transacting over-the-counter
swaps and options?  Is their any policy which requires you to transact on
the exchange?
4.  How far out on the curve can you hedge?
5.  What is the appropriate conversion factor to be used to calculate
natural gas per ton of product produced (our estimate is 25 MMBtu/ton)?
6.  What Green Markets posting (or other postings) are your products tied
to?  If your products are sold based on forward contracts, what is the
normal term of such contracts?  If sold on spot, to what index(es) are they
tied?
7.  What is your internal price forecast for the price of ammonia for the
next year, 2 years, etc?

Hopefully I am not asking for anything too difficult to obtain.  I do
realize we may need to get a confidentiality agreement in place to protect
the transferral of sensitive information.  Please let me know how to
proceed.

Best regards,

Troy Black

 I have replaced the third sentence in Section 7.1 as you requested.  Please 
review and let me know if the changed language is as you requested.  

Harvey,
 Troy Black asked me to forward the attached for your review and possible 
execution.  Please call me at (713) 853-6895 if you have any questions.

I have reviewed the above proposed confidentiality agreement and have made 
certain modifications which are in line with the confidentiality agreement 
presently in effect between ENA and Markwest.  Since the new agreement is to 
cover Markwest for the period that they are letting Enron review Markwest's 
financials which are scheduled to be publicly released next week, the term 
references therein need to only cover the period from the date hereof until 
such financials are scheduled to be released, which I understand to be next 
week.  The change to Enron Corp was made because the employees who will 
receive the information are now employees of Enron Corp.   Please have your 
attorney contact me if there are any problems with the manner or substance of 
the changes noted in the document.

counsel feels that this is incorrect, please have them furnish me with the

Dan, istead of assigning the contract I would prefer to set up another

What do you think?  I understood that the purchaser of HPl was to get all 
Texas deals and since this was in ENA for regulatory reasons, just like 
Entex, it would be assigned to the new marketing entity that was being set 
up.  Has something changed so that these utility accounts are not going to 
the purchaser of HPL business?
Also, I need to amend the Southern union contract  at Austin (Colorado River

Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

Don't know what you are talking about.  They gave Sylvia their form with 
their view of how the world should revolve around their wishes in October 
2000.  She sent it up here is late January for Legal's initial review.  I 
understand it mimics the Utilicorp agreement.  If you have some incite that 
would lead you to believe that they would sign our Master, please send me a 
credit worksheet so that I can prepare a Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.  Also please give me a contact so that we can forward the new 
contract to that person for execution.

To All:

Please provide myself and Sylvia updates on the ISDA and Master Firm Purchase 
Sale contract negotiation with EnergyOne Ventures LP.  Sylvia is looking to 
transact with this counterparty and they are willing to sign our contracts.

Thanks

John,
 My first question is how does Cutter determine Harley's volume?  This 
procedure should be added to the document providing for the fixed price.  Has 
Harley set up Cutter as his Seller's Representative so that he can provide us 
notices, volumes, statements and receive Harley payments?  If not, we should 
add that to the Harley agreement and have Cutter sign in the capacity of 
Seller's Representative.  Call me at (713) 853-6895 to discuss in further 
detail.

Dan,
Cutter Oil Company, one of my producers has a meter connected to a Columbia 
Gas Transmission line.  Harley Drilling & Producing is currently putting a 
small volume of gas through this meter.  I pay Cutter for all the flowing 
gas, Cutter then pays Harley for his portion.  Harley is wanting to lock-in a 
fixed price for a firm volume for part of his gas, about 40%-50%.  Cutter has 
in the past locked-in fixed prices for firm volumes and most likey will do so 
in the future.  

Two producers, Cutter Oil & Harley Drilling, wanting to lock-in fixed prices 
for firm volumes for gas flowing through one meter owned by Cutter Oil:
Is there a method to lock-in a portion of Harley's production at a fixed 
price which flows through Cutter's meter?
What contractual language needs be added to the ENFOLIO GAS PURCHASE 
AGREEMENT?
Should an addendum be added to both contracts (Harley and Cutter)?

John 

Fran,
 I understand from John Blaylock that I am to direct an email to you 
regarding the treatment of certain vested Enron benefits.  My name was 
included on the list of attorneys and paralegals with whom AEP could talk to 
regarding possible employment for continuation of legal representation for 
HPL's business lines.  I met with Gary Prescott yesterday and do not know 
whether AEP will or will not make an offer.  However, in the event they elect 
to make an offer, I would like to know what my options are relating to (1) my 
vested Enron stock options, (2) any unvested options, (3) the Enron Savings 
Plan.  Regarding the Savings Plan, would I be allowed to leave the funds in 
the plan, as if I had retired, or would I be required or permitted to roll 
those amounts into a rollover IRA?  What actions would I need to take 
regarding the amounts that are in the Deferred Compensation Plan?  

 Enron is currently subsidizing a portion of the costs of internet services 
through Time Warner Roadrunner.  Will these costs continue to be subsidized, 
and if so, by whom?

Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

Please review and let me know if this is what you wanted.

Cary,
 Jeff Hodge asked that I incorporate the agreed to items from their request 
which was forwarded to Jeff by Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001 into a 
document.  I have taken the document that Jeff forwarded to Sherry Brinkman 
on December 7, 2000 and included the acceptable changes that Jeff indicated 
were acceptable in his email to Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001.  If this is 
your understanding, please let me know what else needs to be done to finalize 
the documents.

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last 
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next 
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back 
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas 
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the 
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase 
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that 
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that 
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the 
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and 
trueup each month for the prior months activity.  

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

	John Enerson
	02/21/2001 11:33 AM
		
Dan - please confirm for Dan that the pricing will be different after the 
last three trading days of the month for the NYMEX contract.  Dan - can you 
make sure you check with Patrice for this exact number so Chuck can send the 
invoice.  Thanks.

   
	
	

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for 
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we still 
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  The 
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the 
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck

I would recommend that once the trueup information is available and verified, 
a credit statement be prepared and forwarded to Heartland, such statement to 
provide that the credit statement is to be used in determining the next 
month's (April) prepayment.  I would not wire them the true-up amount so long 
as we have any reason to believe that they will continue to be in some level 
of operation requiring some level of gas purchases.  John, any comments.

	Charles Jacobs@ENRON
	02/21/2001 01:03 PM
		 
So what should the invoice look like for the March prepayment?  Should I just 
bill them the 1,500/day at the NX3+.34 next Monday; let them pre-pay that and 
then wire them whatever money is owed back to them after the trueup (probably 
sometime mid-April after the pipeline statements have been received and the 
volumes have been acutalized)?  Or does somebody want to estimate what the 
buyback volume and price would be so I can deduct that up front?

Dan,

Effective 2/1/01 the above mentioned CP's merged to form El Paso Merchant 
Energy, L.P.   Both CP's has an acceptable GISB.  Could you please look over 
the GISB for Coastal  (attached) so that we can determine whether to 
terminate this contract?  In case you wanted to view El Paso's GISB, I have 
attached it also.

Thanks,

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone 
through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep 
especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.

No, They are with two separate entities which each need to stay in place.  Am 
I missing something?

	Bridgette Anderson@ENRON
	02/21/2001 03:17 PM

If you let the dogs chew the phone lines, you will never get your DSL service

No, The canadian contract is only for canadian business.  I do not recall the 
assignment when El Paso and the Canadian group split, however, I do no want 
to allow the canadian agreement to be used for U S business.  

	Bridgette Anderson@ENRON
	02/21/2001 03:58 PM
		
No, maybe I am missing something.  Unless I am reading this incorrectly El 
Paso Merchant Energy Canada Inc. assigned all assests and contracts to El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. effective 12/31/00, therefore assigning K#96054452 
(10/1/00).  My line of thinking is that we will still have two masters for El 
Paso.  Also, since the master was written to cover Canadian business wouldn't 
it make this K a little broader for all transactions?

that up to you.  You might have forgotten how to effectively harass.  You 
might enjoy the refresher.  Your decision.

Ellen,
 As we discussed, please change the Special Conditions: to read:  
 
 In consideration of the delivery of 310,000 MMBtu of gas by Customer to 
Company pursuant to Part A above and the redelivery of 310,000 MMBtu of gas 
by Company to Customer pursuant to Part B above, Company will pay Customer 
the sum of US Dollars $123,070.00 on April 25, 2001.  Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.2 of the Base Contract, a 
party's delivery obligation pursuant to Part A and Part B above shall 
continue until such party has delivered an aggregate of 310,000 MMBtu of gas 
to the other party.

 I have discussed the above with Deirdre and she is okay with the language.  
Remember to  add signature lines for each party and provide Deirdre with a 
copy for her records.

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

This was forwarded to me by Phil DeMoes.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?
Phil DeMoes
02/21/2001 01:30 PM
FYI.
Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Pat,   
 Please note that you were able to open this mail without any loud noise.  
Next time i might send something that could open with some type of noise that 
might not stop even if you power off the computer.    But not this time.  

 Please put me down as attending the mark-to-market presentation.  Also, 
Include Stacy Dickson as an attendee.  

Mary,
 Please disregard the attached email that I previously forwarded to you.  I

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

This was forwarded to me by Phil DeMoes.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?
Phil DeMoes
02/21/2001 01:30 PM
FYI.
Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Susan,
 I agree with you. Use the CES GISB for EOL transactions.

Not sure who's available for this, but here goes.

Mississippi Valley Gas Company has shown up for review in EOL.  There are two 
executed masters.  One is a CES GISB (96028960) dated 1/1/98.  The other is 
our MPSF (96001043) dated 1/1/93.

My vote is for the CES GISB.  Can I please get an official call on the best 
one for EOL, including collateral language?  They are attached for your 
review.

Thanks!!

Susan

Bob Bruce has set up a meeting with Ken Raceler to go over the changes that 
went into effect 12/21 of last year.  They will meet on March 5th from 1 to 3 
p.m. at the Hyatt Regency - Sandelwood Room A.  He says that eventhough they 
are trying to keep the group small it makes sense that you and I attend.  He 
did say that space was not a problem.  I told him that you and I did want to 
attend if for no other reason than to find out about the gray areas that we 
still need to be watchful of.  i.e. who is an "eligible contract participant" 
under the revised law.  What representations need ot be made, if any, by the 
customer?

These are general conceptual concepts that need to be addressed.  I have not 
attempted to redraft the language, only to point out areas where we will need 
to work on modifications to the Contract language.

1. Section 5.01 Provision needs to be changed so that Termination Payment is 
first paid by Company to Customer and if not paid by Company after notice, 
then the Customer would be entitled to make a draw under the Surety Bond.

2. Section 5.03   Provision needs to be changed to reflect that the initial 
bond term shall be __5__ years.  At the end of the initial term, the Company 
shall either replace the bond with a new bond for remaining  term of 
prepayment, provide a letter of credit for the remaining amount of 
prepayment, or provide a corporate guaranty.  

3. Section 7.01 This provision should be okay under the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000 enacted as of December 14, 2000.  The Customer 
needs to represent to the Company that the Customer is an "eligible contract 
participant" under the Act.

4. Section 10.02 10.02.05 - Company has no control on the substance of the 
opinion of counsel for the surety bond provider.   The substance of such 
opinion should be as negotiated between the bond providers counsel and the 
Customer.   10.02.06  Should Customers inablility to get funding be an out 
for the Customer?   10.02.08  Likewise, should the Customer's inability to 
complete any swap agreements be an out for the Customer?

5. Section 21.01 21.01.02  Company should get aleast 5 business days notice 
of nonpayment before the Customer should be entitled to cause an Early 
Termination Date.  21.01.03  As previously noted in 5.03, Company should have 
the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the Term Sheet.  
Contract and Term Sheet need to be made consistent.

6. Section 21.03 and 21.04   Provisions of the Contract need to be consistent 
so that all obligations of the parties are netted before any payment is 
made.  Also 21.03 should first provide for payment by the Company and if not 
made, then by the surety or other security provider.  We shouldn't have to 
pay the Termination Payment to the Customer and then invoice the Customer for 
any Market Exposure Damages under section 21.06.  These should be netted or 
aggregated in computing the Termination Payment.

Mark,
 Jeff is in London and asked me to make the requested changes to the 
Contract.  I have taken the redline version that he previously provided and 
added the additional changes.  The changes that I made were in 4.2 (15 days), 
Art. 5 (deleted "but for no longer period"), and in  Arbitration (added 
language for independent arbitrators based on the amount in controversy), and 
changed (Texas to New York in the 12th line).   I have also attached a clean 
copy which accepted all of the redline changes.  If acceptable, please print 
2 originals of the clean copy, have them signed, fax me a copy of the signed 
signature page at 7136463490, and mail the two signed originals to me.  Once 
I receive the faxed signature page, I will let Jennifer know so that she can 
have any subsequent transactions entered into pursuant to the terms of this 
contract.  Please call me at 7138536895 if you have any questions.

Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  I made the 
requested change in the Term section.  That section defines a Early 
Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 contract years.  As such 
no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract section.  Please call if you 
need anything further.  

        Thanks, Dan

Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  The marked 
form is now in black.  I made the requested change in the Term section.  That 
section defines a Early Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 
contract years.  As such no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract 
section.  Please call if you need anything further.

In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback 
volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 
per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of 
this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The 
transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel 
of 1%.

Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing 
in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct 
procedure.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .

Molly,
 When you brought me the resumes last week, you indicated that you had 
screened certain of the applicants and that Janette had certain ideals 
concerning the group.  I have had the resumes reviewed by Harry Collins, 
Carlos Sole, and myself and would like your opinion regarding the following 
applicants:

 Vanessa G. Griffin She is the current temp that is filling in for this 
position.
 Mary G. Martinez Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
 Esmeralda Gonzales I believe that Mary Cook has talked to her on more than 
one occasion.
 Sheryle E. Malek
 M. Denise Keauquier
 Maggie Valles
 Mary Lou Browder Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
Additionally, Travis McCullough has been lobbying for us to talk to the temp 
that is currently filling the position for which he has hired his old 
secretary.

 If the foregoing list is okay, we would like to start the interview process 
Wednesday afternoon.  I have suggested to Harry and Carlos, that we jointly 
interview each applicant.  If this is acceptable, I will obtain access to a 
conference room for this purpose.

 Please let me know if there are any problems relating to anyone on the above 
list.

Thanksgiving is set at Mom's for Thursday, November 23, 2000 at noon.  Hope 
to see each of you there.   Try to cheer Mom up.  She seems to be a little 
depressed.  Maybe its the fact that her job has been cut back and she feels 
that she has no outside activities to occupy her mind.  

Regarding the January 1, 1998 GISB and the April 1, 1998 GISB, the January 1, 
1998 agreement appears to be a better fit for trading matters which could 
extend beyond one month.  I assume that this was assigned to ENA.  

Please add to Miscellaneous Section of Dedicated Reserve Contract between ENA 
and Hurley.

10.7?? Seller's Representative:  Seller does hereby appoint Cutter Oil 
Company as its agent and third party representative under the Contract (the 
"Seller's Representative") and does hereby authorize such Seller's 
Representative to give and receive all notices, to make and witness any tests 
to be made of the gas and measuring equipment and adjustments to such 
equipment; to receive statements for gas delivered or to be paid for 
hereunder; to make and receive any and all pipeline nominations for gas to be 
delivered hereunder; to receive and receipt for payments made or to be made; 
to give and receive changes on quantities of gas to be delivered; to furnish 
Buyer allocations upon which Buyer may make any and all payments due Seller; 
to adjust any mechanical difference that may arise between Buyer and Seller 
with respect to measurements, billing and payments made or to be made, the 
allowance of credits and any undercharge or overcharge with respect to such 
difference; and to otherwise perform Seller's obligations under the 
Contract.  No appointment of the Seller's Representative will discharge 
Seller of its obligations hereunder and Seller shall indemnify, defend and 
hold harmless Buyer from any claims, damages or losses, including, without 
limitation, attorney's fees, made as result of any act or omission to act of 
the Seller's Representative WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED 
THERETO, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER 
SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE.

Concerning, Vanessa Griffin, yes, please check with Janette.  Both Carlos and 
Harry are pleased with her work.  I have her resume if you need a copy.  
Please screen M Denise Keaufquier.   I also have Mary Lou Browder's resume 
and can fax it to you if you would like.  Please let me know.

In terms of negotiation of the ISDA, we sent out a draft to them a few weeks

Grant,
 I have incorporated the language you provided to me in the attached 
document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's office that they 
will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the person executing the 
contract for ENA is authorized to execute contracts for ENA.  No other party 
signs as to form or terms, however, the officer executing for ENA will 
require that the deal person and I initial on the line next to his 
signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft resolution.  ENA will accept 
the enacted resolution and will not require that the City Attorney issue an 
opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable, please print off 2 
originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me for ENA's approval 
and signature.  Once the contract is fully executed, I will return one fully 
executed original to you for the City's file. 

2001-012bcrfm is the one month extension which has been revised to reflect 
the reduced DCQ and the changed price for the first 8,000 MMBtu per day.

2001-012abrcrfm is the redline version of the proposed Transaction Agreement 
which has been changed to provide that Westvaco is to only provide 
alternative delivery point information to Company when Westvaco receives 
volumes through such points which should have been received from Company.  

2001-012abcrfm is the clean version of the above redlined Transaction 
Agreement .

George,
 I would suggest that the necessary language be added to the Special 
Conditions block of the Transaction Confirmation.  I would suggest the 
following language be inserted in each applicable Transaction Confirmation.

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise contained in the 
sentences previously added to the end of Section 13.5, the parties agree that 
the price to be applicable with regard to any volumes outside of the +/-10% 
tolerance shall be the Gas Daily "Daily Mid-point" price for the day 
following the day that the parties discover the existence of volumes outside 
of the +/-10% tolerance."

I have red-lined the changes that I feel we need to address for a short term 
spot deal with the City of Austin.  Please review and let me have your 
comments.  If you want ENA to do the deal, I need to make a few additional 
changes for the items ENA cannot do.

Veronica,
 She did not make the changes you requested to cover both contract and 
non-contract transactions.  What do you want me to do.  Her language works so 
long as we have a written contract covering each of the physical obligations.

	Veronica Espinoza/ENRON@enronXgate

We are ok with the structure of the deal as discussed ( Purchase 4000 @ day 
MichCon @ NYMEX + 0.21(0.20) with an option to fix the price -  APR - OCT).  
However we would like to have this done under a contract. 

Dan, we want to know whether we should do this under a "Master Purchase" or a 
"Master Purchase, Sale".  

Thanks

Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to

Just to confirm what Dan Hyvl told me:

Use GTCs on both those deals until he can review the Single Transaction 
Purchase Firm contract (96005067).  Based on preliminary information, he 
feels that this contract was not set up to use as a master.  If Dan later 
determines that those transactions should indeed be under the contract, we 
can change the contract and inform the Confirms group (and Logistics if 
necessary) accordingly.  

Please keep Elizabeth informed of what's going on.

I'll keep you posted on what Dan wants us to do.

Thanks,
SBR

Remember I have to leave early today, so if we don't get to it today then 
please remind me first thing tomorrow and we'll finish our review of it.  If 
Elizabeth calls you regarding the deal, you can set up a GTC if necessary but 
I'd rather be sure before we do anything else.  Since gas doesn't flow on 
this deal until 03/01/01, it shouldn't be an issue today.

THANKS!

Hey Stacey,

Thanks for the clarification, no problem......I just want to make sure you 
know this is the committed reserve contract that you said we will research 
later, that is why it is still there.

Sharon

Stacey Richardson@ECT
02/26/2001 08:58 AM
Sharon,

I'm not trying to make a big deal of it.  I also think that Elizabeth would 
let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal.  

This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see 
when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read "added user tag").  I just 
realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't 
subtract 12:00 from military time).  I apologize.

I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.  Maybe we have a 
Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.  I know we sometimes to have 
to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done that 
already and still don't see a contract.  Let me know if you see the same 
thing.

I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs. 
face-to-face communication.  I just wanted to make sure you knew about our 
policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.

FYI - once a telephonic deal has a contract attached, it will stay in your 
portfolio until the deal is VALIDATED.

Hope this clears everything up!

Thanks,
SBR

Sharon Gonzales@ENRON
02/26/2001 08:30 AM
Hi Stacey,

I was not aware of that deal, and actually did not leave till about 5:15 on 
Friday. I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.  I have 
two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after 
being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary 
deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the 
portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that 
portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.

It has always been my practice to keep checking the telephonic and make sure 
they do have contracts attached since they sit out there so long.

Thanks,
Sharon

Stacey Richardson@ECT
02/26/2001 07:59 AM
Hi Sharon,

I was checking the portfolios this morning and noticed a deal input on Friday 
around 4:30 that didn't have a contract attached.  We usually don't get too 
many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check your 
portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.  Even though this deal 
won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO 
outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every 
day.  We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or 
requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.  I 
also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have 
attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached 
(non-problem) deals each day.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular 
deal.  I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make 
sure we don't get nailed on it some day.  I know you've been pretty busy 
handling other desks as well, and I appreciate that.

Dan -

I have revised the Velsicol confidentiality agreement per our discussion 
earlier today.  Could you please take a look at the attached and let me know 
if it meets your approval?

Please give me a call at 53923 when you have had a chance to review.

Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement 
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security 
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please 
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation for 
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put 
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty 
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL. 

Thank you,

Russell

Irene,
 These become HPL contracts on the effective date of the assignment.  As such 
I would use that date as the effective contract date and the assignment 
date.  The original contact date can remain the same as in the contract 
file.  Tom/Steve - Do you agree?

Dan, to follow up on the phone message I just left for you!

In the ongoing process of automating TRRC Sales Tariff Filings,  we have 
encountered several issues for which we need legal clarification in reference 
to all the sales contracts that were assigned from ENA Sales to HPL Sales.

What date should be filed as the Original Contract Date?

 What date should be filed as the Contract Effective Date?

What date should be used for the Contract Amendment Date - i.e. the 
assignment date?

Steve,
 I made the same change to both Oneok and PG&E regarding payment following 
the service month.  Is this correct.  Please check each document and if okay, 
please forward to the counterparty for their execution and return.

Grant,
 I have made the changes they requested.  Please review and if they are 
acceptable to you and to the people on the Central desk, them send this to 
all parties in replacement of the one done January 4, 2001., 

Darren,
 The changes are okay.  Since they are making the changes to their document, 
please have them accept the red line changes and send you the signed

Sandi,
 As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I 
believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts 
that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put in 
place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also 
wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA 
wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not think 
that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There are 
certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company, 
these being the contracts with Entex, etc., after we decide how ENA also 
wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need 
a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done.

Dan,
I am preparing the assignments of ENA contracts going into Lodisco as well as 
those going to HPL. The PSA at exhibit 4.13 (x) lists those going to Lodisco. 
Is that still accurate? If not, can you forward to me an updated list? Also, 
is there a list of those ENA contracts that are to be assigned to HPL rather 
than Lodisco? Let me know--

Thanks,
Sandi

A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully 
interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they 
limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day 
month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all 
business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that 
would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately 
supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a 
increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.

	Phil DeMoes@ENRON
	03/07/2001 01:07 PM
		 
Lets discuss.
Phil,

Thank you for your explanation of the billing process.  Your email raised
some questions for us.

Specifically, we do not understand your statement that the GISB is an
interruptible contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.

The GISB form you mailed us is similar to GISB's which we have received from
other companies.  All specifically state in the bottom disclaimer paragraph
of the first page that "This Contract is intended for Interruptible
transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and may not be
suitable for Firm transactions of longer than one month."  Further, in the
interior of the GISB, on Exhibit A, there is a place to check whether one
wants firm or interruptible.

The intent of this email is to clarify.  Our interpretation is that GISBs
can be for firm (which is what we would want to do), and they would be for
31 day months as well as 30 day or less. Do you agree with this?

If our interpretation is correct, it is not clear why a Master Firm is
needed.  Can you explain what the value add is to our doing business?
[Perhaps it would be useful for a case where we wanted to cover our long
term purchases for a combined cycle plant which we intended to operate every
day of the year other than scheduled maintenance outages.]

Lastly, in our notes from our meeting, I wrote that Enron had offered an
initial $20MM credit line for Oglethorpe. When doing physical contracts
either under a GISB or your Master Firm, does this amount represent a Mark
to Market limit or a nominal limit?

We have our people reviewing GISB, ISDA, and Master Firm as I write this. We
look forward to your responses.

Larry Bergen
Hey Laurence,

Good meeting you and Larry yesterday.   I think we had some good discussion
yesterday and it seems like we have some things we can work on together.

As far as the contracts, a couple of clarifications and an answer to your
question below.

You should have received a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement via email
and hard copy.  Additionally, you have already received  a GISB contract
and a ISDA Agreement.  Here is a brief description of what each of them do:

   GISB - Gas Industry Standards Board Agreement - this is an interruptible
   contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.  OPC would not be able
   to lock forward NYMEX prices on this contract but can purchase short
   term supplies.
   ISDA - this contract is for financial positions only.  If you wanted to
   enter into swaps or derivative based products, you can perform them
   under this contract without ever having to take physcial delivery.
   Master Firm - Under this contract, OPC will be purchasing firm gas
   supply and will be able to lock forward values on the NYMEX.  Note that
   this is a physcial contract which will require OPC to take delivery.
   OPC will receive a bill from Enron around the 5th after the month of
   delivery and will be required to pay no later than the 25th.  If the
   25th is on a weekend or holdiay, then the invoice will be due on the
   next business day.  OPC payment obligations are always after the month
   of delivery no later than the 25th with no need for any payments
   beforehand.  Note that under Triggering Event in Section 4.2, either
   party may need to provide additional credit assurances in the event of a
   material change which could cause a letter of credit to be issued.

Let me know if you did not receive the Master Firm Agreement or if you have
any more questions.

Thanks.

Phil DeMoes

Phil,

One quick question we forgot to ask yesterday.  If OPC were to to place an
order for physical contract for a delivery month of this summer,  when
would
we have to pay for this?  Would it be so many days after the end of the
month in which
received, etc? Would there be any cash due upon placing the order?

THE NEW NEWLYWEDGAME
 submitted by MeanBabaJean

This couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband, although very 
much in love, couldn't wait to go out into town and party with his old 
buddies, so he says to his new wife, "Honey, I'll be right back..."?

"Where are you going Coochy Cooh...?" asked the wife.?

"I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a beer."?

The wife says to him, "You want a beer my love?" Then she opens the door to 
the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 
different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.?

The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of 
saying is, "Yes, Honey Pie...but the bar you know...the frozen glass..."?

He didn't get to finish the sentence, when the wife interrupts him by 
saying,"You want a frozen glass Puppy Face?" She takes a mug out of the 
freezer so frozen that she was getting chills holding it.?

The husband, looking a bit pale, says, "Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar 
they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long 
I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"?

"You want hors d'oeuvres Pookie Pooh?" She opens the oven and takes out 15 
dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, 
mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.?

"But Sweetie, Honey...at the bar...you know...the swearing, the dirty words 
and all that. .."?

"You want dirty words Cutie Pie?..HERE, DRINK YOUR F*****G BEER IN YOUR 
FROZEN F*****G MUG AND EAT YOUR F*****G SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING 
ANYWHERE! GOT IT A*****E?!!"

    A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless.
     "Mummy, Mummy, what are those?" he says pointing to her breasts. "Well,
son,"she says, These are balloons, and when you die, they inflate and float
    you up to heaven," Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation
and
goes
    off quite satisfied.
    Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the
kitchen.
    "Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!" "What do you mean?" says his
    mother."Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both
of
    her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps
yelling,
"God, I'm coming! God, I'm coming!"

Jan,
 Can you let Christian know that I will not be in the office on Friday.  
Please have him download the substance of the call to me next Monday.  I will 
check my voice mail tommorrow if he needs to talk to me.

Participant code:  881292

Grant,
 I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do 
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the 
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
 1. I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the 
contract would be executed by the City.
 3. I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency 
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a 
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
 5. I have added the word "reasonable".
 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, 
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement 
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the 
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination 
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be 
necessary to attain closure.
 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be 
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's 
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend 
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was 
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was 
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a 
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default 
extends for more than 5 days during any month. 
 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate 
rating applies to ENA.
 10. I have changed "a" to "the"
 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of 
Force Majeure.
 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due 
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language 
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a 
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you 
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were 
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in 
using language that had been provided by the City.
 14. I added the word "reasonable".
 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the 
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% 
over prime language.
 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs 
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I 
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and 
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the 
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have 
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know 
that before we execute the Contract.
 19. I have added the word "reasonable".
 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should 
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.  
 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to 
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing 
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our 
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows 
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the 
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we 
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that 
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should 
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to 
the terms and provisions of the Contract.  

 I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you 
care to discuss any of these matters.

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

  Grant,
       I have incorporated the language you provided to me in
the attached
  document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's
office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on
the line next to
  his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
resolution.  ENA will
  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's
  approval and signature.  Once the contract is fully
executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

THE GIFT OF LIFE
 submitted by Amber Tozer
 
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, "Today I 
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day 
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 
50 years."

The cow objected, "What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you."  So God 
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, "What you are 
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that 
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years."

The dog objected, "What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give 
you back my other 10 years of life!"  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, "Monkeys 
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey 
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span."

The monkey objected. "What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks?  
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back."  So God agreed.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, "Your job is to sleep, 
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is 
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life 
span."

The man objected.  "What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, 
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and 
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will 
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?"  So God agreed.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing 
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support 
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making 
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, 
sit by the front door and bark at people! 

Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).  She was 
not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.  Richard 
opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the 
Taub lawsuit.  This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface 
rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain 
surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.  Richard explained that 
if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and 
well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.  In that event HPL 
would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its 
condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.  Because the 
Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not 
affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not 
have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage.  

Okay.

Please limit your use of e-mail to work purposes only!

Kim,
 Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio 
to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded 
to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to 
include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for 
short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, 
we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we 
can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show 
them what we got for the default quantity.

Kim,
 What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

	Kim Ward

Dan,

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we 
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a 
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their 
language.

Thanks, 

Kim

Michael,
 
 Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents 
for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 
2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the 
clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 
below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have 
been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.

 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always 
be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less 
than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.   
I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited 
for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of 
examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that 
Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and 
Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that 
event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from 
Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the 
price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 
3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's 
total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual 
purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ 
would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price 
in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).

 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should 
Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties 
are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas 
requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.

 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you 
requested. 

Michael,
 Hopefully I have fixed the page number on the header label in the attached.

Janet,
 I have changed the attached for ENA.  Please let me know if you need 
anything further.

Mark,
 I have made the changes noted in the fax which you sent to Jeff.  If the 
contract is acceptable, please print off 2 originals and have them signed and 
forward to Jeff for signature by ENA.  Once the contract is finally executed, 
Jeff will return one fully executed original to you for your files.

Susan, 
 That is correct.  If ENA wants to trade with Coral, It will need to use its 
Firm GTC and document accordingly until a new contract is negotiated with 
Coral.

	Susan Elledge@ENRON
	03/13/2001 01:48 PM
		 
Hi Dan,

I have a copy of a letter dated 8/2/99 from ECT to Coral Energy Resources, 
L.P. assigning the referenced contract to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The 
assignment was never made in Global Contracts.

If you agree that it should have been assigned, as the letter says, I will 
assign it today.  If I do assign it, Coral will no longer have a firm master 
contract for trading.  I will also have to remove it from EOL.

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Thanks!
Susan

Ed,
 I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for 
the counterparty.  I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an 
officer will sign.  If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk 
heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign.  
Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this 
counterparty.  I am holding the contract for that person.  If it is someone 
on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the 
contract be done in ENA's name.

Kim,
 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

Travis,
 Peter Keohane was the attorney who was working with PG&E to put a contract 
in place similar to what ENA agreed to.  I have not seen any amendments 
proposed by PG&E, did they get omitted from my email?  I am attaching the 
proposed amendment which I had forwarded to PG&E last year to enable them to 
trade on Enron Online.  
Please let me know if you need anything further.

	Travis McCullough
	03/13/2001 07:25 PM
		 
PG&E made a proposal to John Lavorato and Bill Bradford today to secure some 
additional gas supplies from ENA and Enron Canada.  I am faxing a copy of the 
presentation and relevant documents to each of you.  I think that this is a 
deal that we are interested in looking at.

John and Jim, I think the only question we will have for you immediately are 
the bankruptcy implications associated with the advance payments.  PG&E 
claims there are none (of course).

Dan, since you reviewed the original PG&E (Core) Master Agreement, can you 
review the proposed amendments to that Master?    

Mark -- I don't think Enron Canada is a party to the PGE Master.  Can you 
take a look at the form ENA executed and see if there is any reason why Enron 
Canada couldn't execute the same form?

Note that PG&E also wants to be re-established to trade on EnronOnline.  I 
understand the only impediment to that is that the masters need to be amended 
to provide that Enron, not PG&E, is the confirming party, and that we were on 
our way to documenting those amendments when this all blew up a few months 
ago.  Dan, can you resurrect those amendments so we can see if we can weave 
them into these amendments?

Dan,

ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited 
through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with 
the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you 
comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!

NEW LANGUAGE
-Submitted by PATRICIA L GOONETILLEKE

The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will 
be the official language of the EU rather than German which was the other 
possibility. As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded 
that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5 year 
phase-in plan that would be known as "Euro-English".

In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will make 
the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of 
the"k". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year,?when the 
troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like 
"fotograf" 20% shorter.

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be ekspekted to 
reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will 
enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to 
akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent "e"s in 
the language is disgraseful, and they should go away.

By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th" 
with "z" and "w" with "v". During ze fifz year,?ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd 
from vords kontaining "ou" and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer 
kombinations of leters.

After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor 
trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer. Ze 
drem vil finali kum tru! And zen ve vil tak over ze  world!

As you are aware, Franklin Adkins has removeed his meters from ENA effective 
February 1, 2001.  Mr. Adkins has a fixed price, firm deal with ENA  for 
13,000 Dth/month @ $3.075.  The term is 4/1/00 through 3/31/01.  Mr. Adkins 
has breached his contract with ENA by pulling his meters 2 months before the 
end of the contract.

Attached you will find a schedule calculating what we owe Mr. Adkins for 
January 2001 Actuals, LESS the contractual commitments for February and March 
2001.

Should a letter as well as this schedule be sent to Mr. Adkins explaining 
that ENA is reducing his January payment by the February and March 
commitment?  If so, would you write the letter?

 Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable 
in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience.

Chris,
 The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed 
to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the 
copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we 
will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 
month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term 
deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined 
single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as 
our last long term deal except for price? 

Bobby:

Kim,
 I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of 
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we 
need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version 
that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this years 
volume and price.  What is your preference?

I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to 
BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the 
entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP.

Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

Texas City Facility -
 The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be 
strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron 
and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 
MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in 
place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to 
that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply 
under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the 
facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were 
terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility 
although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the 
Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in 
place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity 
obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in 
volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has 
shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts 
invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power 
purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase 
of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next 
day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of  
creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These 
notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has 
provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force 
majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state 
that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking 
valves, etc.

Clear Lake Facility -
 The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to 
deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the 
base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was 
negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and 
delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is 
required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes 
supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be 
amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser 
cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment 
allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery 
points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force 
majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility 
which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S 
pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity 
to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not.  

Debra,
 I have looked over the cancelled GISB that CES tried to put in place with 
FGU.  Nothing in there of note.  Therefore, please prepare our standard GISB, 
do not use any of their language.  When it is ready, please email to Michelle 
Klein and to Jared Kaiser .

Dan,

ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited 
through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with 
the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you 
comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

Please review the attached draft letter for Heartland.  Is the letter to be 
signed by Bradford or someone else?

Jared,
 The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed 
their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why 
should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the 
other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and 
their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances 
together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed 
Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and 
forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call 
me and we can discuss.

Grant,
 Attached are the two transactions that result from spliting the original 
deal.  Please advise Crestar that they need to revise the assignment document 
to reflect an agreement for Transaction No. 1 dated March 22, 2001 instead of 
March 5, 2001 and they should provide for a complete assignment of that 
Transaction No. 1. Document 2001-23acrfm relates to Transaction No. 1.  Don't 
you agree?  If you agree, please print off 2 originals each and send one of 
each to Crestar, and email a copy of each to Bob Bowen for his Confirm 
Records.

This to remain     This to be assign-
with Crestar.     able by Crestar.

Dan, Gulf/Keyspan have agreed to the two separate documents without a 
specific contract number.

Please prepare and send up to me

There is one revision to the volumes, they are  11,740  and 8260     rather 
than 11600 and 8400

Thanks

Grant

PS - have you read the assignment agreement and if so, do you anticipate any 
issues?

Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

	Grant Oh

on the assignment ot BP separately.

Thanks

Jim,
 I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sales 
Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on 
your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can start 
on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the 
Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several 
omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will 
not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed 
out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hub 
first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's 
discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy.

I will be putting an ad in the chronicle also.  

Grant,  
 Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition 
or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a 
proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of 
creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains 
undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected 
Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such 
proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable 
documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be 
dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to 
effectuate such dismissal,"
 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.
 13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.
 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt 
to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by 
mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the 
satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the 
use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?
 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into 
transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the 
trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.  
However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people 
on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is 
signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction 
with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, 
the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact 
list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.  
          Dan.

Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

  Grant,
       I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
  do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
  in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
       1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
       2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
  when the contract would be executed by the City.
       3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
       4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
  Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
  a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
       5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
       6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
  provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
  statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
  then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
  Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
  should not be necessary to attain closure.
       7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
  be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
       8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
  period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
  scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
       9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
  separate rating applies to ENA.
       10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
       11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
  event of Force Majeure.
       12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
  due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
  language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
  that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
  written.
       13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
  that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
  were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
  it in using language that had been provided by the City.
       14.  I added the word "reasonable".
       15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
       16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
  over prime language.
       17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
  needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
  grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
  rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
       18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
  requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
  have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
  know that before we execute the Contract.
       19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
       20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
  should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
  contract.
       21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
  to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
  willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
       22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
  allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
  that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
  We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
  employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
  enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

       I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
  you care to discuss any of these matters.

Purchase/Sale Agreement

   <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

  Dan:

  First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
  Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

  More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
  reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
  changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
  about certain of its terms and conditions.

  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
  exhibits.

  1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
  which
  should be deleted.

  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
  of
  January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
  contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
  the
  contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
  to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
  (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
  Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
  Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
  Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
  How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
  Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
  omission?

  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
  attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
  consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
  determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
  whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
  before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
  to
  receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
  obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
  City to exercise these rights.

  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
  bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
  bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
  dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
  that
  backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
  City
  is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
  Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
  (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
  Please explain.

  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
  ?

  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
  as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
  (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
  60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
  law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
  don't understand it.

  13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

  14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
  "attorneys' fees.

   15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
  accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
  governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
  applied,
  with respect to Customer."

  16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
  City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
  should not apply to it.

  17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
  City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
  what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
  opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
  deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
  in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
  undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
  an
  opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
  "attorneys' fees."

  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
  legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
  legal
  policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
  amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
  opinion.

  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
  a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
  behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
  this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
  hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
  response.

  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
  until Wednesday, March 7.

  Sincerely,

  Grant Kolling

            Grant,
                 I have incorporated the language you provided
to me in
  the attached
            document.  I have been informed by the Corporate
Secretary's
  office that
            they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency
showing that the
  person
            executing the contract for ENA is authorized to
execute
  contracts for ENA.
            No other party signs as to form or terms, however,
the
  officer executing
            for ENA will require that the deal person and I
initial on
  the line next to
            his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
  resolution.  ENA will
            accept the enacted resolution and will not require
that the
  City Attorney
            issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is
acceptable,
  please print off
            2 originals, have them approved, signed and
forward to me
  for ENA's
            approval and signature.  Once the contract is
fully
  executed, I will return
            one fully executed original to you for the City's

Michael,

 I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following comments.

1. Change the reference to Consenting Party to read as follows:
  
2. Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some 
applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment, 
however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for 
making its own nominations each day.

3. Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and 
Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas.

 Please call if you have any questions.

Everyone;

Further to yesterday's discussions, attached is a revised draft of the
assignment agreement. Please provide any further comments by email.

Yours truly;

Please review the attached Transaction for compliance with your deal.  If 
additional changes are needed, please advise, otherwise forward to 
counterparty.

Ed,
 We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed 
because the revised 11.2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as 
of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the party 
and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome 
or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof, all 
without listing specific types of events which might be considered.
  You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for 
economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the 
preceding sentence.  By example, assuming that more than one transporter 
could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point, if the 
transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure, the 
Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining 
transportation on another transporter, irrespective of the cost.  
 I trust that this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to call 
me at (713)853-6895.

Dan,

Ed Fernandez with The Energy Authority replied to our GISB contract with the 
following questions.  Could you please address and copy me with your response.

Thanks for your help,

Jared
Disregard my question about the arbitration process.    AAA selects 5,
Enron/Tea can strike 2 and then AAA can appoint the one arbitrator.   But
even after that, Enron/TEA can challenge AAA selection.   In short, we have
no problem with Enron's arbitration language.

                    Ed Fernandez
Jared,

Our atty suggests we find get clarification on a couple of issues regarding
your amendments:

Special Provision 11.1:  T GISB is already fairly broad in scope "...any
cause not reasonably withing the control of the party claiming
suspension...."  The amendment to 11.2 repeats the same, but removes
specific examples.
1. Why are the specific examples removed?
2. Am I correct in presuming that Enron wants to make it clear that Force
Majuere cannot be claimed for economic purposes?

Special Provision 13.9:  Under the AAA rules, is only one arbitrator
selected from the very beginning, or are a few arbitrators selected
initially, and then each party can pick and choose until eventually there
is only one official arbitrator?   Like a jury selection...sort of.

Thanks,

Ed

Walter,
 I do not think that they reviewed the language with their legal group.  They 
just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language 
makes no sense.  Their is no connection between the Financial Statements and 
the Confidential Information.    Additionally their is no term.  As 
redrafted, the document is totally unacceptable.  Please tell them we need to 
go back to the Enron response document which we previously provided.  Thank 
you.

Has this all been taken care of through the assignments from HPL to ENA?  

Please let me know if there is anything that Global Contracts needs to do.

Thanks,

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

Debra,
 I had a type in the definition of Material Adverse Change.  Please resend if 
necessary.

Based on Stacy's comments yesterday, I have changed the last sentence of 
11.1.  Her comment was that the last sentence of 11.1 said events of force 
majeure may inclucde and 11.2 said events of force majeure shall include.  
Now they both say shall however I have tied it to the preceding sentence of 
11.1.

satisfactory.

Our hope is to have this agreement signed Thursday.  Michelle's fax and
counterpart execution clause should facilitate execution.  Let me know if
you expect any problems with execution.

Dave,
 I have taken your word file that you forwarded to Travis McCullough and 
merged it into the Amendment that I had previously forwarded.  The only item 
that needs explanation is your comment concerning Paragraph 11.4.  The signed 
version of the contract that was provided after signature by Charlotte goes 
directly from the SDP language to paragraph 11.5.  As such I would like the 
language inserted that you indicate is already in the contract.  I agree that 
the language was in the versions prior to the final version.  Please call me 
at (713)853-6895 if you have any questions.  If not, please have PG&E sign 
two copies and forward to me.  I will have them signed by ENA and will return 
a fully executed original for your files.

Sylvia,
 I have taken Brant Reves comments and incorporated them in the red-line 
mark-up of the EnergyOne Ventures BAC agreement.  Those changes are reflected

forward to counterparty for their comments.

Ellen,
 Would you please email me a blank transaction agreement that ena would use 
to confirm a enron online type transaction.  I need to doctor it and attach 
to an amendment I am doing with PG&E.  Thank you.

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

Linda,
 It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done 
in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its 
marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract 
with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL 
sale to AEP.

	Linda S Bryan
	03/27/2001 02:06 PM

If ENA has a contract with Dynegy that the East Desk is using currently, then 
that contract will not be going with HPL.  If ENA is currently doing business 
with Dynegy in Texas, then the Texs Desk of ENA should be using the same 
contract as the East Desk of ENA is using.

	David Baumbach
	04/02/2001 12:31 PM
		
Just for my own knowledge ... does Texas need to negotiate contracts or do we 
have contracts that cover all activity no matter what region.  For example, 
if Dynegy currently does business with our East desk, does Texas need a 
separate contract or do we use the same contract?

Deirdre,
 A red line provided by Kim Decell is attached at the end of this email.  
Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the 
areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus 
signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used 
interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity 
or Minimum Daily Quantity.  Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a 
default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any 
time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities 
(default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough 
default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for 
fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point 
of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and 
Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering 
Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for 
regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate 
guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to 
be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language.

Dan,

I have attached a document which compares the draft Master Contract to last
year's contract.  The majority of the changes you will see are necessary to
convert a deal-specific contract to something more like a set of "general
terms and conditions" that will be supplemented with the deal-specifics in a
Transaction Confirmation.  These essential changes include (1) the
replacement of any deal-specific item such as price, point of sale, contract
quantity with a reference to the Transaction Confirmation, (2) the inclusion
of language for Firm Baseload, Firm Swing and Firm Swing with Term Purchase
Quantity so that all types of purchase arrangements are addressed and (3)
the addition of Sections 1, 2 and 4 to introduce and explain "Master
Contract" and "Transaction Confirmation".  These changes necessarily lead to
more definitions.

In addition, we have created our own Events of Default language which is
almost identical to Enron's Triggering Events language.  We can discuss any
changes you might like to make to our language.

The remaining variances, with 2 notable exceptions, are subject to
negotiation and these include liability language at Section 10.3 and the
removal or replacement of Locked Prices language at Section 8.3.  The 2
items we are not willing to change are (1) Section 9 Taxes and (2) the
addition of the previous Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment
Threshold language.  These were accepted last year ONLY because the parties
had agreed to certain purchase terms and the effective date of the contract
had passed.

For all the reasons above, we cannot use last year's contract verbatim.
However, I believe what we have is, with the 2 exceptions, very similar to
last year's contract.  I appreciate that we all spent a lot of time getting
last year's contract finalized and it reinforced the need for us to have an
executed set of general terms & conditions in place PRIOR to the bidding
process.  We are targeting March 31 for execution of Master Contracts with
all parties desiring to bid in Wisconsin Public Service's RFP, which is
expected to take place in early April.

I will be out of the office from 10 am today until Monday, but if you need
to contact me during this time, either leave a voice mail, which I will be
checking, or send an email which will be forwarded to Tim Sexton.

Thanks for your help Dan.

Kim,
     I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If
we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the
version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for
this years volume and price.  What is your preference?

please send an original to the counterparty.

My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with 
our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract 
through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the 
last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties 
if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff.
Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward 
it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line 
changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution.

are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both 
parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due 
to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will 
forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

I will continue to work to make sure these are the only contracts and if I 
find any new agreements, I will supplement the list.

Dave,
 As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for the 
applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is the 
Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant delivery 
point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore, please 
finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for execution by 
Enron.

I would like to take  Monday April 9th,  and Friday April 13th.

Debra Perlingiere

Gary,
 Please review the attached confirms.  if the appear in order, please send to 
the counterparty.

Grant, 
 I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order, 
please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature 
by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available to 
handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of 
incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a 
fully executed contract for your files.
 Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of 
the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your 
transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for 
giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for 
its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if 
Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and 
Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO 
notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such 
failure.  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make 
their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled 
volumes.    I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  
the OFO provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I 
can verify with the transport group.

 LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus
Cookie." It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, "I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe."

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
"Only two fifty, it's a great deal!" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "twohundred and fifty dollars"
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, "What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point."

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.
I was basically told,"Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding
 your money." I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get 
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun."
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I
said, "Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off," and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....

 NEIMAN MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)
2 cups butter
 4 cups flour
2 tsp. soda
 2 cups sugar
 5 cups blended oatmeal ***
24 oz. chocolate chips
 2 cups brown sugar
 1 tsp. salt
 4 eggs
1 - 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated
 2 tsp. baking powder
 2 tsp. vanilla
3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)

* Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
 * Cream the butter and both sugars.
 * Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking 
powder, and soda.
 * Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.

 Roll into balls and place two inches apart on
 a cookie sheet.
* Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.
 * Makes 112 cookies.

 PLEASE READ IT AND SEND TO EVERY PERSON YOU
KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL
ADDRESS!
 THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC!

 Have fun!!! This is not a joke-this is a true
story. Ride free,
 citizens

Grant,
 One last change,  Kim Ward agreed to reduce the penalty provisions in 3.2 
and 3.4 from $0.15 to $0.015.  The rest of the contract was unchanged.  As 
stated in previous email, please forward two signed originals to me for 
Enron's further handling.

Please review the new added language to see if this is what you have agreed 
to do.

	The hip, new HELLO ENRON T-shirt made its debut this week, and employees 
around the world are wondering where they can find one.  You can't buy them, 
but you can win one.  
	
	Here's how: listen to the program and respond to the attached survey.  Every 
employee who answers the five survey questions will be entered in a drawing 
to win one of hundreds of T-shirts that will be given away in September.
	
	To win, submit the survey by September 15 to hello-enron@enron.com or Linsey 
Hasenbank (lhasenb@enron.com).  You may also fax to 713-853-6790 or send to 
EB 4932 in Houston.

There are two ways to listen to HELLO ENRON:

 (1) on your telephone by dialing 713-853-HELO or toll free 1-888-335-0403
 (see home.enron.com for international numbers);

 (2) or on your computer through streaming audio -- visit home.enron.com for 
access.

Thanks for listening!

Ruth,
 Please review to verify that I have included all of your changes.  I believe 
that the language in the first 3 cover us if the last agmt isn't done, 
otherwise, the last one covers the trueup of negative values.  Do you 
concur?  Please let me know if these are okay, and I will get my secretary to 
deliver to you originals on ENA stationary.

Please review the new added language to see if this is what you have agreed 
to do.

You really didn't have to rub the age bit in.  I know that I am still too 
young.  Saw Mom yesterday.  Will try to get back Sunday, but can't say for 
sure.  See you there if I can make it.  Write sometimes.

Currently Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday are open.  Let me know when and 
where the Meeting will be.

I am scheduling a meeting to discuss Processing accounting issues and would 
like to have it on Tuesday, 4/10 in the afternoon or sometime Wednesday, 
4/11.  It is critical that each individual identified above be able to attend 
in order to address all of the issues.  Please let me know your availability 
so that I may schedule a time that everyone may attend.

Thanks for your assistance.

Enron.  Please call if you need me to make a copy for you.

Grant,
 Bruce called to say the language is okay.  Hunter also confirmed the 
language.  Please print out the attached confirms and forward them to 
Crestar.  Hopefully this is the last time.

I thought that we were each faxing our signature pages.  I sent Enron's 
earlier, however, I have yet to receive any signature pages from the other 
entities.  Please fax to Dan Hyvl at (713) 646-3490.

BP's fax number is (403) 233-5655

Just to clarify, are we all putting the documents together for ourselves and
faxing execution pages with originals to follow?  Or am I to wait to receive
an original before executing and faxing?

Michael,
     I have reviewed the assignment documennt.  I intend to make two
changes which I hope you make in the copies that the other parties are
signing.  These being that the Assignment be effective as of April 1, 2001
                    "Kleiner,

                                           Subject:     FW: Assignment of

Everyone;

Attached is a revised assignment agreement which we hope you will find
satisfactory.

Our hope is to have this agreement signed Thursday.  Michelle's fax and
counterpart execution clause should facilitate execution.  Let me know if
you expect any problems with execution.

Phil DeMoes asked if we could put together a contract with these folks.  I 
was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would 
want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the 
attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to 
putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and 
Mark Greenberg are working on and if so, should I forward to them?

Comments:

Not with all of their changes.  We were going back to our original language 
relating to representations and implied warranties.  Otherwise, I believe 
that their language only deleted reference to a Texas law designed to protect 
individuals from big business making improper warranties, i.e. triple damages 
for little guy, big guy only gets his damages.

Don't you want to sign up as a contestant on this show?
-
CBS is showing "Survivor 2" this winter. In response, Texas is planning
"Survivor, Texas Style."

The contestants will start in Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San
Antonio, down to Houston and Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio,
on to El Paso, then to Midland/Odessa, up to Lubbock and Amarillo. From
there, they proceed to Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.

Each will be driving a pink Volvo, with a bumper sticker that reads "I'm
gay, I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."

The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

I believe that the Crestar deal is almost finalized.  According to my 
records, Transaction Number NV8176/370753 was partially documeted with a GTC 
confirm (2000-087crfm.doc attached) dated January 4, 2001.  This covers a 
firm sale of 21,100 MMBtu by Crestar to ENA for the period November 1, 2000 
through October 31, 2001.  The remainder of Transaction Number NV8176/370753 
has been documented with two GTC confirms (2001-023crfm.doc and 
2001-023acrfm.doc also attached) dated March 22, 2001 (Revised).  
2001-023crfm covers the firm sale of 0 - 8,260 MMBtu per day for the period 
November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001 and 2001-023acrfm covers the firm 
sale of 0 -11,740 MMBtu per day, also for the period November 1, 2000 through 
October 31, 2001.  By assignment agreement (Crestar assignment.doc attached) 
dated effective as of April 1, 2001, Crestar assigned 2001-023acrfm to BP 
Canada Energy Marketing Corp.   
Ellen Wallumrod has requested that documentation be provided to her to enable 
her to rebook the portion documented by 2001-023acrfm for the period 4/01/01 
- 10/31/01 as a result of the assignment.  Please provide Ellen with the 
necessary paperwork or forward to the party who needs to provide her with the 
necessary paperwork.

Janet,
 Please review the attached to verify that I have made all of the changes.  
Thank you.

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a 
confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

Dan J Hyvl
04/02/2001 08:55 AM
Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Enermetrix will be matching us up with the Buyers.  We would have the right 
to perform a credit check and turn around in 48 hours however we should know 
the counterparty before we submit a bid.  This would be for both gas and 
power.  Additionally, the agreement that I sent to you was already negotiated 
by EES and has concessions in it that can speed up the process.

Lets discuss.

for execution by Enron and return of one fully executed copy.

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Sounds like legal mumbo jumbo. I would advise getting John't input in case
he is more familiar with the reasoning behind this jargon.

Katherine S. Yates
CPS Attorney
353-2069

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:  (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

(See attached file: CITYPublicServiceSanAntonio.doc)

Attached please find a revised Enfolio Contract with CPS.  The changes
      incorporated in the attached contract are:
1)  "City Public Service (San Antonio)" has been changed to "The City of
      San Antonio, acting through City Public Service Board".
2)  The effective date has been changed to "October 1, 2000.
3)  The changes requested in items 1 and 2 of the addendum have been
      incorporated.
4) The Utilization of Small Business Concerns language has been added as
      the last item in Appendix "1", and
5)  An additional representation has been added at the end of the
      Representations and Warranties in Appendix "1" relating to the
      necessary authorizations with respect to the execution, delivery and
      performance by Customer of  this Agreement.

If these changes are acceptable please advise and we will forward two
      original copies for execution.

Phil,
 I have reviewed the confirmation letter and have made several small 
changes.  I believe that I sent you hard copies, however, if you don't 
receive them, please print two of the attached.

darren,
 This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have 
signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The 
counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general 
partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no 
reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you 
agree?

Please prepare a Master Physical according to the terms of the worksheets. 
Please call if you have any questions.

A store owner was tacking a sign above his door
that read "Puppies for Sale."

The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, "How much are you gonna
sell
those puppies for?".

The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30-$50."
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
"I have $2.37, can I look at them?"

The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.

Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked "What's wrong with that little dog?"

The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.

The little boy got really excited and said, "That's the puppy I want to
buy!"

The man replied "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you." The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said "I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for."

The man countered, "You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies."
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, "Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands."

The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, "Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of

these puppies will have an owner such as you."

IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHETHER SOMEONE
APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE, ACCEPTS YOU AND LOVES YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY.

A REAL FRIEND IS ONE WHO WALKS IN WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD WALKS AWAY.

SEND THIS TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CONSIDER TO BE SPECIAL.

Please review the revised representations and warranties language. If 
acceptable, please print 2 copies, sign and forward to Janet Wallis at Enron 
for execution by Enron and return of one fully executed copy.

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Sounds like legal mumbo jumbo. I would advise getting John't input in case
he is more familiar with the reasoning behind this jargon.

Katherine S. Yates
CPS Attorney

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:  (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

(See attached file: CITYPublicServiceSanAntonio.doc)

Attached please find a revised Enfolio Contract with CPS.  The changes
      incorporated in the attached contract are:
1)  "City Public Service (San Antonio)" has been changed to "The City of
      San Antonio, acting through City Public Service Board".
2)  The effective date has been changed to "October 1, 2000.
3)  The changes requested in items 1 and 2 of the addendum have been
      incorporated.
4) The Utilization of Small Business Concerns language has been added as
      the last item in Appendix "1", and
5)  An additional representation has been added at the end of the
      Representations and Warranties in Appendix "1" relating to the
      necessary authorizations with respect to the execution, delivery and
      performance by Customer of  this Agreement.

If these changes are acceptable please advise and we will forward two
      original copies for execution.

Charlie, 
 Please review the attached letter agreement to see if it conforms with your 
understanding of the processing arrangement that you intend to have with 
Hunt.  If so let me know and I will remove the red-lining.

Ellen,
 Okay to send GTC confirm with attached GTC terms; however, please delete the 
conflicting price on the attachment.  the attachment should be Month and 
Monthly Volume.  Delete Price from attachment.  Don't you agree?

Joan,
 Attached is the Letter Agreement for St. Mary's Production LLC.  According 
to Charlie, St. Mary's production is being delivered at the same points as is 
the Hunt Southern Louisiana production.  Therefore, the St. Mary's letter is 
identical to the Hunt letter which Charlie is sending to Hunt today.  If this 
is not the case, please let me know and I will modify to fit the terms of the 
St. Mary's deal.  Otherwise, please print off as many originals as you need 
and send them to St. Mary's for their execution and return.  Please call if 
you have any questions.

 I have modified both documents based on Joan's comments.  I trust that you 
will get them distributed to the proper parties.

Dan & Debra -

Could you please tell me the effective date of our newly-executed ENFOLIO 
master with City of Palo Alto?

Thanks,

Jay

Phil,
 Attached please find the first draft of the proposed confidentiality 
agreement between ena and midcoast.  Please read paragraph 7 together with 
the definition of Proposed Transaction in the first paragraph to determine if 
you think the language is sufficient to cover us.

Forwarded as requested.  I will check with Gary regarding the status.  At the 
time that I sent this I was informed that they were ready to sign.
	Dan J Hyvl
	03/13/2001 11:36 AM
		 
Michael,
 
 Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents 
for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 
2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the 
clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 
below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have 
been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.

 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always 
be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less 
than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.   
I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited 
for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of 
examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that 
Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and 
Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that 
event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from 
Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the 
price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 
3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's 
total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual 
purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ 
would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price 
in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).

 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should 
Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties 
are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas 
requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.

 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you 
requested. 

Russell,
 Please review the attached draft of the draft Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement which has been drafted based on Exxon's comments as 
necessary changes before they will allow the Mobil plant to schedule gas 
under the terms of the October 1, 1995 Agreement.  I have merely incorporated 
the credit language that was used in the October 1, 1995 agreement into this 
agreement and have attempted to make the other changes that Exxon was 
requesting.  Question, is the parent company still Mobil Corp. for the 
purposes of the MAC.  Do you still agree with the prior credit requirements 
as provided in the October 1, 1995 agreement, and if not, please provide me 
with your updated requirements as early as possible this morning so that I 
can incorporate into the agreement prior to presenting it to them for further 
negotiation later today.

Lee,
 Please review the attached so that we can discuss which of their changes 
have been made, which we did not make and the reasons therefor.  The quick 
points being:  sentence at end of 2.3 which takes the place of their items 
1-4; $0.15 to $0.05 in 3.2 and 3.4; item (iii) in 4.2 per their request #5 
except I changes 30 business days to simply 30 days; I did not give them 
their request #6 except I did incorporate the last two sentences of their 
request; I attempted to give them all of their requested #7 except I reworded 
slightly for balance and the items we previously discussed; did not do 
request #8 because we will incorporate that in the Transaction Agreement; 
gave them their request #9, gave them their request #10 except I left in the 
"as is, where is" and the line they omitted when they retyped; did not do 
their item #11, added section 8.9 for termination of prior agreement; added 
their items #12 and #13 but modified as we discussed; otherwise I updated the 
contract and changed references for Buyer's Transporter to simply Company.  
Anything else?

.

Forwarded as we discussed.  Likewise, I will check with Gary regarding the 
status.

Gary,  
 Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal.  
We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their 
assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the 
Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.  I assume that you are having Steve 
Van Hooser work on the Lease Amendment.  Call me if you need anything further.

Arthur Davidson, of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, died and
went to heaven.  At the gates, St.  Peter told Arthur, "Since you've
such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is,
you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven." Arthur thought about it
for a minute and then said, "I want to hang out with God." St.  Peter took 
Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.  Arthur then asked God, 
"Hey,aren't you the inventor of woman?" God said, "Ah, yes." "Well," said 
Arthur,"professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in 
your invention. 
1.  There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion. 
2.  It chatters constantly at high speeds. 
3.  Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much. 
4.  The intake is placed way to close to the exhaust.  And finally, 
5.  The maintenance costs are outrageous." 
"Hmmmm, you may have some good points there," replied God, "hold on." God 
went to his Celestial super computer, typed in a few words and waited for the 
results.  The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.  "Well, 
it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur, "but 
according to these numbers,more men are riding my invention than yours."

Dan,

I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a 
multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HPL 
is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at 
$115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request 
was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view?

Clement
Clement,
 Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable 
in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience.

 << File: gty2846.doc >> 

Wayne,
 I have modified the above contract as we discussed.  The "Customer's Agent" 
language is contained in Appendix "1".  Please have the contract signed by 
JER Partners, a J.E. Robert Company and fax it back to me.  I will then have 
it signed by Houston Pipe Line Company.  I have left the attachment at the 
end as originally drafted until I am able to talk to Gary Lamphier.  If it is 
truly correct that there are no minimum quantity obligations under the deal, 
then Gary may have to reprice the $0.09 discount for the 1000/d.  I will 
leave that up to Gary and you to resolve.

A jeweler watched as a huge truck pulled up in front of his store. The back 
came down and an elephant walked out. It broke one of the windows with its 
tusk and then, using its trunk like
a vacuum cleaner sucked up all of the jewelry. The elephant then got back in 
the truck and it disappeared out of sight.

When the jeweler finally regained his senses he called the police. The 
detectives came and he told them his story.

"Could you describe the elephant?" the cop asked.

"An elephant is an elephant," he replied. "You've seen one you've seen them 
all. What do you mean 'describe' him?"

"Well," said the policeman, "there are two types of elephants, African and 
Indian. The Indian elephant has smaller ears and is not as large as the 
African elephant."

"I can't help you out," said the frustrated jeweler, "he had a stocking 
pulled over his head."

The attached transaction agreement has been signed by the customer on 
4-16-01. We have a faxed copy.  I will send you the faxed copy for your 
files.  Call if you have any questions.

Please review the language under B of Contract Price of the Transaction 
Agreement to see if it isn't sufficient to cover the concept under item 8 of 
Pasadena Usage under your term sheet.  Likewise, I have added item C under El 
Paso Capacity to cover the sale of 1456 MMBtu/d.  Please check the language 
to ascertain that everything is covered.  Have a good weekend.  I will be in 
all next week if we need to further tweak the language.

Dave,
 I am still waiting on the Credit Worksheet so that I can draft the 
agreement.  The Houston credit group claims that they have no request for 
this.  Please verify with the Credit Group so that  they would provide a 
credit worksheet directly to me for use in preparation of the contract.  
Otherwise, let me know how your negotiations on the transactions components 
is proceeding.

Teresa,
 I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We 
have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for 
the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending 
the term is that we do not know what conditions Texas Gas may put on the next 
OFO nor do we know what conditions El Paso may put on the processing.

Teresa G. Bushman

Grant,
 I do not think that their new language will work in the way they think it 
will.  What Bruce indicated to me was that if they determined that they had 
volumes after 9:00 they would offer to us.  If we didn't accept, then they 
wanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area.  
 My understanding of this deal was that we were only obligated to take 
volumes if they were nominated before 9:00.  Is that correct?  Please call me 
so that we can discuss.

	04/19/2001 09:41 AM
		 
Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the
wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST
if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to
9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option
to move gas after 9:00am.

Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the
subject agreement.

Thanks,

RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001

We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the
subject agreement.

The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will
deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have
sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize
all
of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available
on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS
to deliver those additional volumes.

If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined
above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of
this letter provided for that purpose.

 I think that the problem is what is meant by "these costs".  Currently we 
think that it will be negative, but until we get the allocations, we won't 
know.  That is the reason we want to go monthly.  Is there a problem getting 
them to sign something if we need to do it for another month.  The terms may 
be different with regard to next months deal.  Please advise.

CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT

Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for
a bathing suit.

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and
humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the
1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed
for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not
so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and
they did a good job.

Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a
figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she
can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral
suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped
from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill
department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to
a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.

What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and
entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first
thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch
material.

The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to
launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that
if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected
from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a
swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.

I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder
strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!
Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a
while to  find the other.

At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is
that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant
to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.

I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full
view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it
only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me
oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a
lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.

As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the
pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, "Oh There you
are!" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so
sure and asked what else she had to show me.

I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of
masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an
oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of
leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like
Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.

I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in
mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I
thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.

Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style
bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and
bulge  friendly, so I bought it.

When I got home, I read the  label which said "Material may become

transparent in water." I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just
have to stay out of  the water!

Note that the previous contract is terminated 8/31/02 in the new agreement 
and the new confirm is attached at the end of the new agreement.  Any 
comments???

Please allow me to review the terms of the Master before we send the draft.

Darren,
Haldor Topsoe has agreed to terms of 110% of IF-HSC through August 31, 2004.  
I will have legal prepare the Master physical and the confirmation.

As long as we have the Master executed, you can do the extension.

I understand the physical agreement is a must.  However, my real question is 
regarding a two year extension.

Gary the ONLY way that we can do these deals is AFTER the signing of the 
Master Physical Agreement.

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.

-Darren

Dan,

See attached.

 << File: JER-BRE Austin Tech.xls >> 

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

   

Russell,
Please let Dan know you have approved this deal.

Gary,
 Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.  

Dan,
Did we ever send a contract out ot these guys?  I know we discussed it but I 
bet I never requested a contract.  Let me know.

Okay,

to drive you and Stacy tommorrow.   The only time I have next week is Monday.

Has Jeff been good?  Should we ask him too?

	Dan J Hyvl

Darren,
 There are no previous confirmations.  You have one single purpose contract 
that was done in 1994 that has a primary term through 8/31/02.  What do you 
mean "preceding confirmations".  Confirmations are only done under trading 
type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with 
Haldor.  You should become familar with the current contract before you 
request changes to that deal.  

	Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate
	04/25/2001 11:53 AM
		 
Dan,
I am under the impression that this Master Physical Contract will supercede 
any preceding confirmations.Please correct me if I am wrong.

Darren,
 Please reread.  This confirm covers the period 9/1/02 - 8/31/04.  The 
current deal stays in effect until 8/31/02.  Let me know about the hyphen.  
That is the way they signed the last contract.  You have their published 
financials,  How is it in the signature portion of those.

Dan,
Everything looks good. In the openning paragraph, I think that 
"Haldor-Topsoe" should not have the hyphen. Am I correct in assuming that 
this master supercedes all existing confirms?

 << File: 2001-015ctr.doc >> 

Note that the previous contract is terminated 8/31/02 in the new agreement 
and the new confirm is attached at the end of the new agreement.  Any 
comments???

Please allow me to review the terms of the Master before we send the draft.

I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

   

Russell,
Please let Dan know you have approved this deal.

Gary,
 Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.  

Dan,
Did we ever send a contract out ot these guys?  I know we discussed it but I 
bet I never requested a contract.  Let me know.

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?

Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance.

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff.

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing.

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen by Monday October 30 so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
  wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer;
  that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
  faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories=
:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your
  liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=
d
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t=
o
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=
e
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be
 bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=
d
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

Dave,
 I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I 
have a number of questions.
1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on 
Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery 
point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.  
2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also 
talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally 
their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.  
3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the 
same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 
20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than 
the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without 
making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for 
such non scheduled excess volumes? 
 Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the 
transaction agreement.

Lavonne and I  visited with Mom Sunday afternoon.  We cooked outside and had 
a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers 
Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on 
the grill.  What do you think.  Mom's memory appears to be good about many 
things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed 
confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, 
what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of 
memory?  Maybe we can all get together Mothers Day and visit.  Email me back 
please.

Barbara,
 According to the Restructuring of Gas Purchase and Sales Contracts between 
ENA and 
Entex, Entex is to purchase their natural gas requirements for General 
Service Customers from ENA except for 
(i) approximately 30 Bcf per year to be purchased from other suppliers at 
points other than Conroe;
(ii) gas currently purchased from 2 other suppliers at Conroe;
(iii) 10,000 MMBtu of gas per day purchased from a third party during the 
period 4/1/99-3/31/2002;
(iv) volumes Entex purchases from HPL under 2/8/76 gas supply agreement;
(v) 6,000 MMBtu  per day Entex currently transports on HPL under 1991

Attached is a proposed combined gty that TXU is now proposing because of the 
time constraints (one Gty expired yesterday and another is about to expire on 
the 15th).  They would like to combine the business of ENA, ECC with two of 
their trading entities for a total of $50MM.  This format does not include 
the deregulation  language that the prior gty that I sent you both to review 
back in March (they are doing this simply to expedite the process).  Please 
review this format and get back to me with any comments/revisions so that I 
can communicate them to the counterparty ASAP.

Thanks--

Veronica

  

Mark, Dan,

Please review the attached guaranty and provide your comments.  The guaranty 
is to replace the existing guaranty's covering ENA and ECC.

Thank you,
Russell

Just wanted to let you know that I still have not received word from either 
attorney about their acceptance.  So, we haven't received the gty yet.  Let 
me know what we should do.

Veronica

Peter and Dan--

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.

Troy,
 This is the short form confidentiality agreement that credit uses for 
financial information.
I will send you the standard form for transaction information by separate 
email.

Troy,
 The above is the standard ENA confidentality agreement for transaction

Okay with me.  Go ahead and make your arrangements for the headset.

I would like to order a headset for my telephone, much like the ones that 
Taffy, Mary Helen and Carlos have.  Are you open to that and if so, will you 
approve it?  It is just a matter of ordering it through Superior Headset

Please review the attached document to see if it reflects the matters we 
discussed.  I continued Les's marking and added some red-line changes and 
removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more 
than an simple accept all changes to get to a clean copy.  Let me know if you 
need a clean copy so that I can clean up the different colors and methods of 
showing changes.

A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have 
anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone.  
Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him 
after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he 
might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect 
to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He 
reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she 
faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the 
class room sobbing and crying, "Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!"  
All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension 
appears on his face as he says,... "Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her.  
She committed suicide!"

If furtherance to my above reply, EFI and EPOS should not be EOL parties, at 
least not under the Dominion Republic and Guatemala agreements.

Phil DeMoes asked me to forward this document for your review.  

Troy,
 I have modified the agreement and have forwarded to you the final version 
which we and they should sign.

Gary,
 The final version is attached for you to send to the customer and have them 
sign and return 2 originals to HPL.  We can then sign and give them one 
original.

Okay, I have coped with the traders in your absence.  Now I intend to leave 
for lunch, my appointment and tomorrow's activities.  All that means that it 
is now your watch.  The only thing that might occur is Mark Breese.  I have 
placed a voice mail to him in response to his Detroit rfp but he is out.  The 
deal should be okay assuming Mark can make the prices work.  Anyway, I will 
handle with Mark.  Hope everyone gets well soon.  I will be back Friday to 
resume the watch.  See ya!

Sounds good.  We intend to bring the fixings for the burgers, that is , meat, 
onions, lettuce, tomatoes, 16 big buns and 8 small buns.  I think that mom 
has enough mustard and mayonnaise.  If you think we need more buns, let me 
know.  I don't know how many are going to show and eat.  I will leave the 
beans, potato salad, chips and desserts to you and Bettye.

?Sounds great to me. Are you bringing the fixins for the  burgers? Or do you 
want me to get that? I thought Bettye And I could provide  beans and potato 
salad and any desserts. I'm bringing a dewberry pie and another  dessert. I 
think Mom is planning on fixing chicken noodle soup' Buddy saw Mom  today, 
says she was doing real well today. I think maybe working that election  
Saturday was a bit of a strain on her and thats why she seemed so confused  
Tuesday. See you'll Sunday

I agree, Sunday was really enjoyable. It was so nice to have all the moms
that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once.
Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know
what to bring and I'll be there.
In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into
a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in
tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt
to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests
and medicines as she needs to.
I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which
requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we
agree is a "safe" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I
feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or
desires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not "take control"
of her money...just help her "remember" payment of large purchases. She
still needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern is
someone "conning" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2
signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel.
Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see the
day-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and my
attention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom....and between the 3
of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets her
maintain her dignity and respect.
OK>>>>see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need to
bring..Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be so
nice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe it
won't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured..Think about it, if
you'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday..maybe
Christmas? ..Just a thought.

Sunday really was good. We had a really good time also. I think Mom enjoyed
it also. Getting together for Mom's birthday sounds great to me Only have
one suggestion. Tell Mom that we are taking her out for her birthday or else
she will try to cook everthing. Then we can all show up with the food.
I don't know what to say about how she would feel about losing control of
her checking account. Some days she seems really concerned about what she
has in the bank and other times she handles things well. She did give Buddy
a signed blank check to go pay for fertilizer on a Sat. and then when he
went to pay for it on Mom. evening she had already gone in and paid for it
herself that morning. She had forgotten she had told him to do it.She still
thinks she will be put in a nursing home if she forgets things. She told us
again Sunday that they put Aunt Minnie in a nursing home because she forgot
the stove on. Though i'm sure it was more to it than that. I'm open to
suggestions.

Ellen,
 Attached please find a GTC confirm that I prepared for the requested deal 
done by Janet Wallis.  Please call if you have any questions.  I have asked 
Janet to forward to New Gulf if the GTC correctly reflects her transaction.  
I will notify you if there are any changes.

Please prepare an enfolio agreement.  Thanks

Please change the start date to May the 14th

Thank you.  Phil made me promise to ask.

Jeff,
 We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks 
ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it 
to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of 
compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also 
assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 
9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation 
plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I 
will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will 
need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date 
that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated 
that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit 
in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan 
which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see 
no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP 
appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the 
case?
 Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand 
how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for 
a career opportunity with HPL.

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL 
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for 
HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream.  
The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates 
to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made 
pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a 
day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a 
reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream 
represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not 
indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL 
or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been 
allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility 
for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from 
the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written 
correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it 
did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That 
contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation 
evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been 
sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy 
of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the 
Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's 
agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved 
through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum 
of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum 
in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the 
event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to 
remit such amount together with interest to Upstream.

Kim,
 Please review and if okay please send out for signature.  Thank you.

I agree with the corrected amount.  Thank you for bringing that to my 
attention. Spell check doesn't work on numbers or capitals.

There appears to be a typo in the amount due HPL from Upstream.  It should be 
$238,508.61.  I will withhold this amount on the 25th.

 The amendment is effective as of June 1, 2001.  That is the date on which 
the price changes and the date that the term is extended and the date the 
meter number is added.  I have corrected the contract number on the first 
line for the proper reference to the assigned contract.

Cheryl,
 I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the 
deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I knew 
that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period post 
of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or 
Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with the 
confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting 
you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group 
has already indicated that they did not have it.

Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
confirm out of Tagg. 

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!

 I am sorry that you got involved.  The HPL group had already indicated that 
they did not have the documents.

I intend to be out every other Wednesday plus a few other dates.  Jeff's

Read the text before looking at the picture.

A class of elementary students started a class project to
make a planter to take home and wanted to have a plant in
it that was easy to take care of, so it was decided to use
cactus plants. The students were given greenware pottery
of a clown planter, and they painted them with glaze and
had them professionally fired at a class outing so they
could see the process. It was  great fun.

They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters, and
they grew nicely but unfortunately the children were not
allowed to take them home.

The cactus plants were removed and a small ivy replaced
them, and the children were then allowed to take the
planters home.

The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time....

 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these

Could you change paragraph iii at the end of Representations and Warranties
to read:

"(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San
Antonio which govern payments by Customer."

There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Thanks ...

Change the clause after "first priority payment" in (iii) to "under the
ordinances of the City of San Antonio which govern payments by Customer."
There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

As requested, Enfolio shortened and simplified the section on
Representations and Warranties.  The new language is highlighted on page 2
of the Appendix and states the following:

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows: (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to claim immunity on
the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or its
revenues, (iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are
unsubordinated obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance
costs which enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all
indentures to which it is a party."

Do you feel that this language is acceptable?  Thank you for your advice.

Please review the revised representations and warranties language. If
acceptable, please print 2 copies, sign and forward to Janet Wallis at
Enron for execution by Enron and return of one fully executed copy.

                                          Subject:     RE: Enfolio Contract
with CPS

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to
debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.
Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Sounds like legal mumbo jumbo. I would advise getting John't input in case
he is more familiar with the reasoning behind this jargon.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I
have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:
(i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures
to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

(See attached file: CITYPublicServiceSanAntonio.doc)

Attached please find a revised Enfolio Contract with CPS.  The changes
      incorporated in the attached contract are:
1)  "City Public Service (San Antonio)" has been changed to "The City of
      San Antonio, acting through City Public Service Board".
2)  The effective date has been changed to "October 1, 2000.
3)  The changes requested in items 1 and 2 of the addendum have been
      incorporated.
4) The Utilization of Small Business Concerns language has been added as
      the last item in Appendix "1", and
5)  An additional representation has been added at the end of the
      Representations and Warranties in Appendix "1" relating to the
      necessary authorizations with respect to the execution, delivery and
      performance by Customer of  this Agreement.

If these changes are acceptable please advise and we will forward two
      original copies for execution.

Okay, I think, can you red line against the previous wording?

Janet,
 Please review the attached to see that it conforms with your deal.  If so, 
please send an original to the counterparty.

Troy,
 It does not sound like they were interested enough to even discuss the 
proposed changes.  I would have probably given them something very close to 
their paragraph 5 if we had ever gotten over the other items.  Some things 
don't happen.  

	Troy Black/ENRON@enronXgate

FYI,

It is unfortunate that we lose business due to a simple confidentiality 
agreement.  Dan, I do appreciate your efforts with this matter.

Troy

Troy -

I appreciate the time you took to have Enron's legal department review the 
non-disclosure agreement.  Unfortunately, Silgan cannot accept the requested 
changes, and specifically the deletion of paragraph 5.  As a result we have 
decided not to pursue a business relationship with Enron.

Thanks again for your time.

I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as 
having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back 
to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with 
CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I 
understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no 
deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under 
these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and 
thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob 
Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the 
preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise.

THE BLONDE KIDNAPPER

A blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to 
kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a 
kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, "I've kidnapped you." She then 
wrote a note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 
in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north 
side of the playground. Signed, a blonde." The blonde then pinned the note to 
the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.

The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting 
beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with 
a note that said, "How could you do this to a fellow blonde?"

Lee,
 Please review the attached GTC confirm to see if this is what you want.  I 
talked to Darren Vanek about this last evening and he had no problem in 
structuring the transaction in this manner.

I am working with Roche Vitamins, who are trying to trigger a fixed price for 
the remaining term of their HPL contract, from June01 to Feb02.  They want to 
trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d.

Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, 
based on the limited information that we have received from this privately 
held company.  I assume this is still correct?

Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL 
contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical 
contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good 
cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and 
I'll fax it to you.

Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing 
anything.

Thanks

Per the request of Alan Kilpatrick, I am forwarding to you Southern's
comments on your proposed confidentiality agreement.  As you can see,
they are almost entirely editorial and relate to the inclusion of
seemingly duplicative provisions.  The one substantive point is that we
do not agree to venue provisions, although we will agree in this case to
Texas choice of law.

Please let us know if these changes are acceptable in advance of the

 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

	Robert Rose@ENRON
	05/30/2001 03:21 PM
		 
Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Ann Elizabeth prepared an agreement last week whereby
Harris County MUD No. 23 would be allowed certain
access across HPL Bammel property to do work on
their drainage ditches.  After a review of the agreement
by Steve Schneider, he suggested that language be
added concerning a matting of the property over
the pipelines when "heavy machinery" is used.  Also,
he suggested that language as to property/road
restoration be added.

Taffy, can you email a copy of the agreement to Dan

hard copies)?

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you very much,

Cathy,
 At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and 
intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy 
Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed 
this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement 
utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve 
them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, 
I would approve them for execution.  
 Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the 
charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get 
out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be 
negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the 
transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are 
reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services.   
 No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star 
Pipeline.  The only documents faxed were two transportation services request 
forms.  

I was not out any days during this period.

It is my understanding that cashouts coming from Unify look like regular 
sales and purchases.  The accounts used are as follows:

TYPE                                                                ACCOUNT

Cashout Sale - Third Party                             483
Cashout Sale - Intercompany                       484
Cashout Purchase - Third Party                   803
Cashout Purchase - Intercompany              803?

This is how the FERC module in SAP is mapping them.

See Tom's message regarding cashouts.  Please reply directly to him and copy 
me so I will know how to list these transactions on the tariffs and whether 
the revenue is applicable for TRRC Gross Receipts Tax.  Thanks!

  

I guess the transport tariff is as good a place to refer to cashouts as 
anywhere.  How should they be listed on the tariffs?  And what (NARUC) 
account are cashouts booked under?

Dan J Hyvl
11/02/2000 10:00 AM
  

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?

Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.  (When did this get assigned to 
HPL?)

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance. DAN

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff. DAN

Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.  DAN
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen AS SOON AS POSSIBLE so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

agreed to consent to the assignment of the contracts and that he would fax 
the signed consent to me as soon as he could get an officer to sign same.  He 
agreed to send me a letter to that affect in the event he was unable to get a 
signature today.

Candace,
 If you look at your purchase document, you will see that you never received 
the minerals.  Do you agree?

Pls apprise me of your status on the preparation of the bill of sale for the 
above properties.  Short of a mineral search, we have concluded that we want 
to reserve the mineral rights, if any, in our agreement with the buyer.

I have whatever exhibits you need available for this document.  We would like 
to have it by June 1 to offer to our buyer.

Thanks, Dan.

Chris,
 Anne Koehler asked me to email the attached red-line assignment to you for 
her review and revision.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone 
number is (713) 853-6895.

Stacey Neuweiler asked that I forward this to you so that you could print 2 
copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.  I have 
reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they 
are these transporter's typical form.  If time would permit, I suggested they 
negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.  Call me at 
713-853-6895 if you have any questions.  I am also forwarding the Duke 
documents for you to print off and have signed.

Dan,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got
sent out to the field for most of the day.

Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the
legal description.

Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would
be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in
perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line
in place if it so chooses.

Thank you for your excellent and fast help!!!

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

	Robert Rose@ENRON
	05/30/2001 03:21 PM
		 
Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

Ellen,
 This should be okay.  I would prefer that all GTCs in excess of 6 months be

THE STRONGEST MAN

Ted walks into a bar and shouts out, "Who's the strongest person in here?"

The toughest guy looks at him and says, "I am the strongest person around 
these parts!"

Ted politely asks, "Can you help me push my car to the gas station?"

HE SAID/SHE SAID

He said... I don't know why you wear a bra;  you've got nothing to put in it.
She said...You wear briefs, don't you?

He said....Do you love me just because my father left me a fortune?
She said...Not at all honey, I would love you no matter who left you the 
money.

She said...What do you mean by coming home half drunk?
He said....It's not my fault...I ran out of money.

He said... Since I first laid eyes on you, I've wanted to make love to you in 
the worst way.
She said...Well, you succeeded.

He said... What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you?
She said...Turn sideways and look in the mirror.

He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight.
She said...Okay, but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on.

He said... Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm?
She said...I would, but you're never there.

He said....Shall we try a different position tonight?
She said...That's a good idea, you stand by the ironing board while I sit on 
the sofa and fart."

As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you 
faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement 
for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel 
that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the 
agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is 
very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out 
by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace 
the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call 
me if you need anything further regarding this matter.

Again,
 "I accept the terms and conditions of this Pilot Participant Agreement."

Please acknowledge receipt of this.  Thank you.

I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract 
provided to you by the subject party.  The only item that has to be changed 
is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois.  
This sentence needs to be deleted.  Enron would prefer to be the confirming 
party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can 
agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.  Please 
get with your counterparty and let me know how you would like to proceed.

Sorry about that, I am guilty of coping the address info from prior memos.  I 
will update my memos.  Is the last one a Hunt Oil Company processing rights 
letter?  That was the last item i transmitted.

Hi Dan,

I just got a call on a contract you routed to me at my old location.  About 
three weeks ago, my group moved to the 21st floor.  Please send all 
purchase/sale agreements to me at EB2127B and any processing/service 
agreements to Sylvia Campos at EB2127A.  Sorry if I neglected to inform you 
earlier.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Comments:

Cathy, 
 I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a 
limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form 
should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company 
can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in 
Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.

Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have 
been "assigned" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party 
to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL 
transactions.

Thank you!
Cyndie

PS, Accounting was not copied on this message as there is no accounting 
impact on the contract # changes (all deals moved have production beginning 
6/1/01 (no additional production was finalized or cleared on these 
transactions under the prior agreement).

Candace,
 Please review the above documents, let me have the buyers names and 
addresses and I will complete.  Is this the proper description for the

Please review the attached revised document.  I left the references to 
Louisiana in the document because of all the changes to section numbers and 
exhibits that deletion of that section would cause.  At some time in the 
future, I will modify to delete, but it should be okay with the references 
left in for the time being.  Additionally, I suspect that we may need to 
leave it in because we may need to generate a version for the LEG system that 
AEP has in Louisiana.  Let me know if you think we need any other changes.

Richard,
 This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any 
Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to 
the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we 
need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra.

Gerald,
 Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that 
we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can 
this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient?

FEMALE FLYERS

As the airliner pushed back from the gate, the flight attendant gave the 
passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said, 
"Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and 
crew take you safely to your destination."?

Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the 
captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants 
came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the 
captain a woman?"

"Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."

"My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what 
to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."

"That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the 
cockpit."

Nelson,
 Please use the above.  Don't forget to add your language in the last 
paragraph.  Call me if you have any questions.

Attached please find a clean and redline document reflecting the changes we 
discussed this morning.  Please let me know if you need anything further.

Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I was

 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the 
deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no 
bill of sale is needed.

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?

Pls advise.

Good.  Assuming you received my phone mail with the Earp's address etc.,
can you forward me two originals of the offer so that I can send them on to
the Earps?  Again, their street address is 26 Lily Lane in Crane, TX
79731.  The agreed to price is $45/acre at 640 acres, or $28,800.  I.C.
Earp et ux Irma.
I'll call him and alert him when the paperwork is ready to send, hopefully
tomorrow.

Thanks

Senior Hyvl,

Does the following correspond to your voice mail message from
last Friday?  I believe that I was able to follow it pretty closely.

HPL,  ON  BEHALF  OF ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, BONDING COMPANIES, EMPLOYEES AND
ANY  OTHER  PARTY  EMPLOYED  OR  CONTRACTED  BY  HPL  TO PERFORM UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT  (COLLECTIVELY  REFERRED  TO IN THIS SECTION AS "HPL"), COVENANTS
AND  WARRANTS THAT IT WILL PROTECT, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS THE CITY, ITS
EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AND LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO IN
THIS  SECTION  AS THE "CITY") FROM ANY AND ALL THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, DEMANDS,
AND  LIABILITY,  INCLUDING  DEFENSE  COSTS, RELATING IN ANY WAY TO DAMAGES,

As usual,

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!!!

Nelson,
 You are aware that ENA is prohibited from bidding on the Texas volumes for a 
period of 3 months.  Call me if you need any explanation.

Tanya,
 I have received a guarantee for execution by ena from the london office.  
The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is 
guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited.  

Dan,
 I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase 
agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made 
no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase 
up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads 
"above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please 
review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, 
please call and I will modify.

Can you add or attach the attachment that you refer to in your note to Jeff 
Hodge.

Dan:

As you know I will be in London next week .  Could you work with Barry to get 
this finalized.  It sound to me like all that needs to be done is print the 
document and put your initials on it.  There is also an index confirm to 
prepare.

Jeff

Jeff, I understand that Stacey is on maternity leave.  This confirm is long 
over due. I have been working with Stacey to get it done. The attached 
document in it's finished state is what the customer and I have agreed to .  
Can you please have someone finalize the document and send back down to me 
for signatures.  

Barry 

PS. I also need the daily index confirm and we will clean it up also. BT
Barry Tycholiz
11/02/2000 10:56 AM
Stacey,  please find attached the completed marked up GTC that we need to 
finalize and re-submit to Crestar.

TO DO:    I have added a line in part 3 ( blue).  Add this section .  Either 
add in other terms that section 2 and 5 are not applicable for just delete 
them.. my preference is to just exclude them in the other terms piece rather 
than delete completely.

This will complete the monthy volumes confirm for Crestar. Make these changes 
and send back to me today. 

Thanks.

OTHER:  Please e-mail to me the latest version of the AOS balancing confirm 
and I will add changes that we went through. 

Call me if you have any questions but we are almost there... 

PS.  we must get this done now because as of Nov. 6 Crestar loses some of 
their staff and I don't want to start over on this process with new people. 

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts.

Barry,
 Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this 
confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 
and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu 
of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant 
by the language "if the replacement price is not representative of the market 
price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price"?

	Barry Tycholiz
	11/03/2000 02:58 PM
		 

Okay, as to 2,5,8.  Can you explain what is meant by "fixed price" in the 
other and what criteria is to be used in fixing the price?

	Barry Tycholiz
	11/03/2000 03:27 PM
		
I agree with you on points 2,5,8.  just delete them in the confirm.

With regards to point 2. As long as the language reflects that best efforts 
are taken to buy/sell gas at Daily Index when required and then it goes to a 
fixed price I am fine with it.

Barry

Barry,
 The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on 
ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send 
me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need 
to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it 
out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in 
each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please 
advise.

I agree, however, I will exercise my right to vote in the morning to 
hopefully ignore the long line of traffic trying to get into downtown.  

No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got 
resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at 
Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil 
Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 
234-4204. 

	Steven Curlee@ENRON

I just wanted to make sure that you got your problem resolved last Friday.  
Jessica White, who schedules NGPL, should have given you a call.  I meant to 
call and check that afternoon to make sure, but got busy on something.  If 
you would just respond to this email letting me know if everything is 
resolved, that would be great.

Thanks,

Steve

Dan, I will not be sending this document to Crestar.  Raise this confirm 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Can you send down the paper on the AOS daily balancing agreement. This is a 
seperate agreement that is secondary to the firm deal.

Thanks.

There is a second document that Stacey was working on that is pretty much 
identical as the Monthly firm deal but involves only gas on Alliance called 
AOS ( this is like Interuptable gas, but a little different ). The confirms 
has been raised previously, and you should have this on file. 

This is the file name on the bottom of Stacey's last document.  
o:\common\legal\sdickson\agreements\crestarspotcnfm.doc. 

Let me know... 

PS . did you send the confirm to Crestar on the firm volumes. BT

 Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired 
10/31/00 so that I can see how we documented that deal.  For all I know, I 
may have prepared that documentation, however, I can't find a signed document.

	Cheryl Dudley

Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.
There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).
As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as 
if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise?
	Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan@ENRON
	11/03/2000 01:56 PM
		 
Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Please send hard copy of deal ticket.  We do not have access.  Otherwise, I 
think the worksheet is incomplete.  Please complete and include with hard 
copy of deal ticket.  Has the counterparty requested an Enron Corp guaranty 
as a condition of doing the deal?

Per the earlier e-mail, Jason's intention was to send this information on 
this transaction to the confirm group, as listed below - Joe Hunter and Janie 
Aquayo.  Jason is a new person in the Credit Group and was responding to a 
transaction that we were looking into for credit approval.  There is no 
additional credit information that is required to be placed in this confirm 
for this transaction, as is occasionally added by your group.

cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the 
confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal 
number is greek.

Please send out confirm at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.

Oscar,
 I changed para 2 back to unilateral because there is no way for Enron to 
have the information to issue a notice of termination on 11/30/99, only AEC 
will be privy to that and in the event they do not issue notice by that date 
they should remain bound to the deal. I assume that is the only change you 
made to the agreement I drafted last night.  As such I have attached the 
modified version for your use with Credit prior to sending same to AEC this 
morning.

Gregg,
 I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.  Subject to the 
credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the 
ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by 
Reliant have been discussed and resolved.  As soon as I hear from Russell 
Diamond, I will finalize the contract and sent to you and to Reliant.

Russell,
 I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to 
have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the 
master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical 
guaranty that you currently have from coastal.

	Russell Diamond
	11/10/2000 02:23 PM
		 
Dan,

I have forwarded you the Guaranty from Coastal.  This Guaranty is a redline 
version that Coastal has provided comments on.  At this time they do not want 
to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their 
current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming 
merger.  Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments.  The 
contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229.

Thank you,

Russell

Stacy,
 The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared 
in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with 
Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I 
noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I 
agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed 
upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen 
sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the 
ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will 
create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my 
earlier emails and to this email.  Call if this is not what you desire.

The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:

Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered 
into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; 
John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as 
Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of 
William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; 
Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred 
Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et 
ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris 
Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.  

First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation 
in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in 
Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.

The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage 
covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do 
not have copies of these 2 amendments.  

At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged 
into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL 
Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.

Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you need anything further to describe 
these documents.

Ellen,
 Would you mind responding to Barry regarding these confirms.  Thank you.

Ellen,
 I am attaching a redline and a clean copy of the Enovate/Reliant contract, 2 
proposed transactions to be entered under such contract, and a redline and a 
clean copy of the ENA/Reliant contract.  If these meet with your approval, 
let me know and I will prepare execution copies for each party to sign.  
Please note that the credit group made one change to the language in section 
4.2.  

I have this date forwarded these three confirmation agreements to Gary 
Lamphier for his further handling with his counterparties.  I will let you 
know if they get executed.

The new Purchase Agreement looks nonexistent.  Did you intend to attach 
something for me to review?

	Kevin Ruscitti
	11/13/2000 04:42 PM
		
Dan,

Please take a look at the new Purchase agreement and let me know what you 
think.

Thanks,

Kevin

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the 
contract is signed by ENA..  

	Kevin Ruscitti
	11/14/2000 12:01 PM
		

Barbara & Anne,
 I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed 
to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred 
to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, 
the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for 
the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, 
transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, 
Joe would like as much up front notice as possible.

Randy,
 I have attached a simple release and settlement agreement for you use with 
the customer.  Please call if you need anything further.

Veronica,
 The form of the Guaranty is okay.  Please have them correct the name "Enron 
North America Corp." in the first paragraph.  

	Veronica Espinoza@ENRON
	11/14/2000 03:56 PM
		 
Dan--

Please review this Guaranty draft (as it covers physical business).  We need 
to have the Gty executed ASAP, so I would appreciate your quick response.

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Cindy, Thanks for your help. - Claire

Mike,
 The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by 
including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as 
finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be 
in final form and ready for signature.  Please review both documents and let 
me have your comments. If the documents meet with your approval, please 
forward to Ami Beard for her review.   I will be in the office all day 
tomorrow.

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling
you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming,
I've made a few small changes:
Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our
guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of
Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten
the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn
leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or
crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it
is a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while
you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have
made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please
remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering
that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds.
As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of
tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a
recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously
like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.

They are lying.
We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.

We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke
alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.

In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate
table.  In a separate room.  Next door.

Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at
our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private
ceremony.  I stress "private", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances,
enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children
to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed.
It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that
"passing the rolls" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean
your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the
adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence
of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known
name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins
or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.

Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small
fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably
won't come next year either.    I am thankful.

Received email!

I'll be leaving for New Orleans in about 30 minutes for our legal 
conference.  It was fun visiting with you too.  I miss you terribly.

In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between 
ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing  new "umbrella" 
guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and 
also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options 
Inc. (a PG&E affiliate)  These new guarantees will cover all physical, 
financial and power transactions between the above parties.  I have sent them 
the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in 
the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.  Rod is 
resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.

In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to 
return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees:  (1) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power 
Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading 
Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT 
Canada.

I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. 
Prior Guarantees.

FYI, cpy below is governmental.

I just heard from Tenley that you and Steve have been in a pretty bad car 
wreck and are hospitalized in Florida.  My thoughts and prayers are with both 
of you.  She said you were checking your emails so I just wanted to get a 
note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.

I miss you!

We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract:   ISDA Master Agreement ( Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:  March 31, 2000

Counterparty:  Kellogg Company

Transactions Covered: Approved for all products with the exception of: 
Weather and foreign exchange

Per my conversation with Lisa, I am going to open the referenced counterparty 
to trade financial.

Frank:

We have recently rethought our treatment of some of our Western 
counterparties.  Originally, if a Western CP traded power in the West under 
the WSPP Agreement, we permitted the CP to enter into Enron Sales only for 
Eastern power pursuant to the on-line GTCs.  However, we have decided that 
certain of such CPs should not be permitted to trade Eastern power at all.  
Accordingly, please revise the profile for the CPs listed below so that they 
cannot buy or sell Eastern power products via EOL:

Arizona Public Service Company
Avista Corporation - Washington Water Power Division
British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation
California Department of Water Resources
City of Redding
Colorado Springs Utilities
Idaho Power Company
Los Angeles Department of Water & Power
Nevada Power Company
Northern California Power Agency
Pacificorp
Public Service Company of Colorado
Public Service Company of New Mexico
Sacremento Municipal Utility District
Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
Seattle City Light
Sierra Pacific Power Company
St. Joseph Light & Power Co.
Tucson Electric Power Company

If any of these CPs have previously traded any Eastern power products, please 
let me know at your earliest convenience so that I can address this issue.

Please note that this change should not affect the ability of these CPs to 
trade Western power products.

Thanks:

Leslie

Per the request of Mark Taylor, I am forwarding the attached.

Tana,

Attached below are the documents you requested.

Frank

I will be out Monday morning for my home inspection.  Also, I have my Scenic 
Texas board meeting at 2:00 pm in Dallas on Friday, so depending when I can 
get  plane reservations, I will be out some or all of Friday.

We have received the executed Acknowledgement and Termination Agreement dated 
effective as of December 1, 1999 by and among El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas 
Company (formerly known as El Paso Marketing Company, also formerly known as 
Eastex Hydrocarbons, Inc.), El Paso Merchant Energy Gas, L.P., El Paso Energy 
Corporation,  and ENA (formerly known as ECT).  Such document referenced the 
merger of Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. with and into El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas L.P., and the subsequent assignment of El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas 
LP's rights, duties and obligations to El Paso  Merchant Energy-Gas Company.

Under such agreement, the parties agree that:

1.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that (a) the Sonat 
Marketing Company and Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. financial Transactions 
shall be governed by the El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company financial Master 
Agreement dated as of April 20, 1995; and (b) the Sonat physical transactions 
shall be governed by the El Paso Enfolie Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement 
dated March 1, 1998;
2. El Paso Energy Corporation, as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall 
remain in full force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in 
Item 1 above;
3.  Enron Corp., as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall remain in full 
force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in Item 1 above;
4.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that the Sonat 
financial Master Agreement dated as of September 1, 1994, and the Sonat 
Master Firm Purchase/Sale physical Master Agreement, will be terminated;
5.  Each of ENA, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and El Paso Energy 
Corporation agree that the Sonat physical Guaranty dated August 28, 1995,  
the Sonat financial Guaranty guaranty dated August 28, 1995, the Enron Corp. 
financial Guaranty dated as of August 28, 1995 and the Enron Physical 
Guaranty dated May 1, 1994 are thereby terminated.

All of the above is rather complex, and I've tried to reduce 3 pages of 
"Whereas" clauses into 1 paragraph, but I will distribute the document to the 
usual suspects, so any confusion about parties should become clearer.

On the attached list please note that per my email of 04/17/00, U.S. Gas 
Transportation, Inc. has been acquired by Aquila.  Future trading for this 
counterparty should be done out of the name USGT/Aquila LP.

Any update yet?

No, a transaction had been entered into, the Master Agreement to govern it 
was signed, getting the certificates was one of the requirements under the 
agreement.

Jan, that was good, thanks for sharing it!

Mark asked if you could work on the following with our new secondee, Jason.  
I provided Jason a hard copy yesterday since he didn't have a computer yet.

comments are addressed and point me in the right direction with regards to 
negotiations while Mark (Taylor) is away.

I've been a little distracted.  I've had a contract on a new house, and we 
had the inspections yesterday and everything looks good, so we're just moving 
forward for a May 5 closing.  Also, I have had short in an electric line that 
keeps shutting off all the electricity to my apartment and they've finally 
isolated it and it is somewhere underground in my garden!  Dalzenia has been 
in there digging my garden up, and I think Louis has found the problem in the 
electric line so I hope they are going to get it fixed today so Dalzenia can 
replant my garden...it's always something.

Anyway, I don't have a barbecue, so I will have to borrow one.  How do I go 
about doing that?

My closing is set for June 5, move-in date for my new house is June 9, so 
there should be no problem.

We have a new lawyer that started in our group yesterday.  His name is Jason 
Peters.  Can you get him added to the Master Swap Agreement database ASAP.  
Thanks.

How goes moving the Portland masters?

I am available Saturday after my morning run.  If you would like some help I 
would be happy to help out!

Can we get some credit?  Much thanks!

Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy 
Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place 
between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We 
recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I 
was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval 
to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is 
713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as 
above.

Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me 
know.

Greg

I needed to whine with you yesterday about my favorite nat gas trader and 
couldn't get hold of you...and then my favorite lazy paralegal already passed 
on some of her work to me!

Can you give view access only to Marie Heard, Robbi Rossi, and Cynthia 
Harkness with Bandwidth Legal to the referenced database.   Thanks!

Attached is the Deemed ISDA for the referenced counterparty.  Please remember

We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract:   ISDA Master Agreement ( Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:  March 31, 2000

Counterparty:  Kellogg Company

Transactions Covered: Approved for all products with the exception of: 
Weather and foreign exchange

FYI

Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at 
Cadwalader to determine if using the word "exchange" in a corporation's name 
would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.

Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word 
"exchange" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing 
so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in 
using "exchange" in your corporate name, however, putting "exchange" in a 
company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.

He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, 
so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea.

I guess you mean Wendi, no Molly?

I forget when you are coming?  If you're in Houston on May 6, Jim Easter in 
the Asia/Pacific Group will be having his XVIII Annual La Dolce Vita Party 
which is always a great blast, and I'll secure you an invite too...let me 
know...!

This time I just pulled out the notebook with the drafts of confidentiality 
agreements you left one of them to do, and they didn't bother to file them in 
the binder, they just stuck them in so when I pulled the file out, the 
documents fell out.

The way this came about, Sheila has a customer that was creating a new 
internal and, initially she contacted Sara and it was Sara's understanding 
that they were in the tranportation business, not trading, and wanted to use 
the word "exchange" in their company name, and did we, as the CFTC experts, 
know any reason why they shouldn't (I also understand it was Julia that 
mentioned to Sheila she might have an issue there).  After my email went out, 
Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure 
sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the 
exchange and less toward the tranportation.  They used words like "online 
clearinghouse" and the like!  So I told Sheila maybe she'd better contact Ken 
Raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there.  I 
haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it.

Mr. Uretsky,

At the request of Michael Danielson, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Confidentiality Agreement.  If the agreement meets with your approval, could 
you please have it executed by an authorized officer of Viant Corporation and 
 

Attached are the Canadian forms as they currently stand.  All of our forms 
are currently under revision, so there may be some more changes coming out 
soon.

We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated April 
10, 2000, effective  as of November 25, 1997, wherein Tembec Inc. assigned 
its interest in Contract No. #J7774.1 dated March 23, 1998 to National Bank 
of Canada.  Copies will be distributed.

We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated 
as of April 10, 2000.  This amendment revises the ISDA Master Agreement with 
the referenced counterparty to bring the agreement up to current form 
standards with changes including, but not limited to:

1.  Adding the Canadian Securities Acts representation;
2.  Making certain changes to elections with respect to Payments on Early 
Termination and amending the Setoff language;
2.  Makes changes to certain credit provisions, including letter of credit 
provisions, the form of letter of credit, the Independent Amount,, and amends 
the definition of "Material Adverse Change" .

Copies will be distributed.

	
	

Tana -- with regard to the message below, DMBB has signed and overnighted the 
agreeement to me.

Tana -- Here's the DMBB contract with the name and address info. you needed.  
We do not have an executed copy from them yet.  However, I think we can get 
them to sign this contract by next week.   Mark Holsworth helped develop this 
agreement.

On the 4/25/00 list, Imperial Oil Resources Limited (cpy id 5193) was on the 
original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of 
Canadian.  Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned 
that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.  So if they are, shut 
them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.  Of course, all 
counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit 
tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a 
determination...but you know that...!

I am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly 
done online with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and ENA and assigning 
them to CIBC World Markets plc and ECC (ECC has a physical master with this 
counterparty, ENA doesn't).  I am adding a statement to the effect that these 
Transactions shall constitute "Transactions" under the ECC Master Agreement 
and want to confirm that "Transactions" is defined as such under your Master 
Agreement.  Can you confirm that for me.  Much thanks!

Too bad you won't be here for the party.  It's always a good one.  Also, 
Sunday is Astroworld day for Enron employees, but you probably won't get here 
early enough to do that either...

Hey, if you run into any problems, my home # is (713) 529-1038.  Don't be shy 
about calling me if you need any help with anything!  I mean it!

All's I have to say is I was here this morning before 7:00 am, and I was the 
only person here until 8:00 am (if you catch my drift)...

Why is an attorney doing secretarial work, much less paralegal work?  Also, 
she is primarily a litigator, and we have found that litigators don't know 
anything about contracts, securing collateral, corporate law, etc.

If we want a litigator, I understand that one of the old time 20 year 
Liddell, Sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's 
ready to leave...

Yes to both questions...

I hope we are confirming trades under the new TXU ISDA Master...?!

	
	                           
	

Are we confirming trades under the new ISDA yet?  Should CRM put you back on 
our distribution now that Marie is gone?

Can you email over to me the form of UK Industrial we worked out while I was 
over there.  Thanks!

I have forwarded the Statoil/J.Aron trades down to Bob Klein and Jeff 
Sorenson to sign off on the actual deals listed.  I'll keep you posted...

Would you like to sign off on this form of assignment since I am going to 
have to send it up to Canada for signature.  Much thanks!

We have received the faxed executed Confidentiality Agreement dated April 18, 
2000 with Fieldston Publications.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels. 

Attached is a list of our transactions.  It includes the former Columbia 
Energy
trades.
(See attached file: Enron nat gas trades.xls)

I'm not Tim.  Perhaps you'd better contact him some other way.

I am getting some pressure to get the database opened to the world.  The only 
thing left to do to get that done was to get the Portland masters migrated 
out.  What's happening with that?

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between the 
referenced Counterparty and ENA dated April 27, 2000.  The copy will be 
forwarded to Dave Samuels.

It is my intention that Dave Samuels maintain a complete file of all the 
Confidentiality Agreements for EnronOnline.  If there is some otherr person 
than Dave who sould maintain the central file repository for EnronOnline 
Confidentiality Agreements please this let me know.

Attached is our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced 
counterparty.

There is a document called "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS" in Marie's directory 
where we all input any CA we have sent.  For some reason since last week it 
has appeared as a "read only" document", so I cannot input the agreements I 
am working on right now.  Can you get that fixed.  Thanks!

Can you email over to me your Paragraph 11 too!  Thanks again.

Attached is our form of Confidentiality Agreement which we would prefer to 
use.  If after reviewing our agreement you still prefer to use your own form, 
Carol St. Clair, an attorney in our group will have to get back to you with 
our comments.   I will wait to hear from you.

We will be celebrating the April Birthdays with an ice cream social on 
Monday, May 1st, at 3:00 p.m. in EB38C2.

I will send out a reminder on Monday.

Congratulations on the first bandwith trades!

I understand we have done two trades today with the following bandwidth 
counterparties:

1.  Broadwing Communication Services Inc. - we have a Master Bandwidth 
Purchase and Sale Agreement executed April 27, 2000, effective as of March 
28, 2000.  It has just arrived in the bandwidth Legal Dept. and Marie Heard, 
the paralegal for bandwidth, will be getting the copy down to Global 
Contracts.

2.  The other party appears to be El Paso Energy Communications, and we have 
no master in place with this counterparty, so an online confirm with the GTC 
should be used here.

If you have any other questions let me know, and I'll try and help you or get 
someone who can!

You are the one!  I hope everything works out, keep me posted and let me know 
if there's anything I can do to help!

Also, I am still working to get that info from London on the margin funds and

are the only holdout.

Just to give a head's up,

In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, 
Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents 
for her group.  The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy 
Zipper, Vice President.  FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows 
certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of 
EnronOnline.

I spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning.  He has come up with 
more deals than were on the list provided by Statoil/J. Aron, and now Bob 
Bowen is checking out the list.  They hope to have it to me by the end of the 
day.  It seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the J. Aron 
person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades, and 
have Bob Bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades.  
Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the 
language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.  Are you with 
me on this?

here's a copy of the deal information.  I left a message with Bob Bowen as
the deal he added appears to be an Enron Canada deal.  The Enron

I printed out the referenced list that you sent me, but it has some

As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have 
the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there 
was any.  Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but 
after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.  We need 
to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of 
the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global 
Contract and the online crew.

Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.  Thanks.

The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.  She really isn't a great 
seamstress.  I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet, 
Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened.  
Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and 
said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used 
them.   I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress 
for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and 
does a great job.  Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off 
Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.   She is an absolute

Confidentiality Agreements.

What is going on with the revisions to the tax language in the ISDA?  I spoke 
to Marie and she said that at year end the tax language out of "ISDAexh.doc 
"was sent to Rhett Jackson for review and as far as she know it hadn't been

Nancy,

Below are the recipes for the party.  The only commitment I have so far is 
for the meat dish, so everything else is up for grabs.  Let me know which one 
you are making.

The directions to my house are as follows:

Hi everyone:

I've attached the recipes for the May 13th Church Gourmet Dinner.  They are in
Word, but please let me know if you have problems with the attachments.  I can
convert them or fax them to you.  I have made notes on the recipes regarding
the advisability of doubling some of them for a party of more than 8 guests.

At the bottom of this email, you can still review Alicia's original
instructions and comments about the parties (and the guest lists as they stand
now).

My only thoughts about dividing up the recipes among your guests are:

1.  Remind everyone to bring a bottle of wine for the group.

2.  The dessert recipe should perhaps not be given to a single male as it
requires a springform pan (an item I'm guessing is not common to most bachelor
kitchens).

3.  The person(s) to bring the soup should also bring bread.

4.  Remind the people doing the main course to do a mixture of pork & chicken.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Penny

We definitely have enough people for a party.  I haven't heard back from some 
people yet, I'll keep trying.  I hope to have some responses when I get home 
from work tonight.  Atached is of list of the status so far:

What do you think?

Andrea,

The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.  That 
red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.  Do you want to choose 
another one.  We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may 
have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.  Let me know your 
choice!

Great choice, I got several responses last night and that was not one of 
them!  All the recipes look really good (as usual).

Suzanne,

Anthony is with the Global Contracts Group.  Can you coordinate with him the 
exact head count as we get closer.  Thanks!

Tana,

The Date looks good for everyone (those that have responded) I have been 
waiting to hear back from all of the invitees.  I will be in touch about the 
exact head count whenever I receive responses.

Sorry for the delay,
Anthony

Anthony,

You never got back to me on whether this date was good and the total head 
count.  Can youu please confirm this.  Thanks.

Carol St. Clair had her assistant reserve EB46C1 on May 24 from 11:30 -2:00 
for our luncheon.  Can you please confirm that that date is good for your 
group and also the total head count.  Suzanne will take care of ordering 
lunch for us.

Thanks!

I got several responses last night and this morning by email, so I am 
attaching a revised list.

We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of 
March 31, 2000 assigning two physical Canadian gas trades (EOL Deal Nos 
137945 and 149472) from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to CIBC World 
Markets plc.  Such trades will be governed by the Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement dated November 16, 1999 between CIBC World Markets plc and Enron 
Canada Corp.  Copies will be distributed

I've got the dinner schedules for 7:30 pm.  Your choice was perfect.  There 
was no overlap in choices on what people wanted to cook.  I couldn't have 
planned it better!

Jeff Hodge is your man!

There was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to 
totally shut down our computers.  Supposedly this virus was all over the 
world.  Maybe we'll hear about it on the news.

I have a meeting set up with IPI next week to demonstrate their system to our 
Global Contracts team leader, the Confirm Desk financial trading head, and 
also Mark Taylor.  Right now I'm working on a summary listing what I think 
our system issues are.  I've traded phone calls with Documentum.  I'm 
actually trying to get this summary done, so I can send it to them to show 
them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their 
presentation on our specific needs.  I've looked at your material for Micro 
Modeling.  I will be contacting them next.

I've got our third paralegal trained, and she's getting up to speed, so I'm 
getting down to the last contracts I'm trying to resolve.  I have another big 
project that ends this coming Wednesday, Thursday I leave for Germany for 
vacation for two weeks, and I hope when I get back to devote my somewhat full 
time to this project finally.

So that's my story, how are you?

Attached are the recipes.  I sent you them all because they all looked so 
good.  Will you be talking to Steve?  I left him a voicemail about the 
dinner.  I have scheduled him for the garlic bread.  I guess I will just mail 
him the recipe.

Attached are the recipes for the Church Gourmet Dinner.  I've got you down 
tor the pork chops (Alicia says  to make it a mix of pork and chicken).  All 
the recipes looked really good, so I thought you might want to look at them 
anyway.

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church
2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet.
3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray

I left a message for Judy Wells and will keep you posted.  Hopefully by the 
end of the weekend I should have an exact head count so I can tell people how 
much to make.  So far we've got 12.  The only recipe so far that is unclaimed 
is the Roasted Red Pepper Dip, you could either do that, or based on the 
number of people, you may do another of the meat recipe, since probably that 
will be the most expensive.  Why don't we chat (via email!) Monday and figure 
out the best way to go.

I've got a call into Peter Shaddock to see if I can borrow his barbecue grill 
and if he can get it to my house.

Another thing too, does the Church have folding tables and chairs to borrow?  
My table will only sit 6 at the best.

I can go either way on this.  I have a nice backyard but no barbecue and not 
enough tables.  But it sounded like you might prefer not to host, and I don't 
mind, I just am not setup to do a big group.  I used to have a nice folding 
table but it was stolen out of my garage.  If you host it I would be happy to 
help out, bring nice flowers, do the dishes, make the pepper dip...!

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am transmitting a proposed form of Annex 
A for the referenced counterparty.  Please call me at x33399 or Sara at 
x35620 if we can be of further assistance.

Are we in agreement that you will be hosting the dinner.  If so, I will need 
to call everyone and let them know the change of plans.  In furtherance of 
that, I will need direction to your house to provide them.

to me and Michael Khajeh-Noori so that we can mirror the documentation for 
the purposes of negotiating a new ISDA with Kellogg's UK entity.  
Alternatively, if it is not possible to e-mail them, please fax them to me (+

The Kellogg ISDA Agreement has been signed, but it is somewhat long.  Would 
you like me to fax it to you (if so, what is your fax no.?) or would you like

Attached is our bilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement when both parties 
are providing Confidential Information.

I don't think you can bird dog her too much.  She receives in the emails and 
forwards them on to the relevant job group.  The person with the job then 
decides who they do or do not want to interview.  I don't think Gretchen will 
have much to do with that.

If we are replacing an existing Master Agreement with an ISDA Master 
Agreement, please change the status in the master swap agreement database 
from "Executed" to "Executed-Under Amendment".  Once a master is executed, 
"Executed" or "Executed-Under Amendment" should be the only two options you 
should ever choose.  If you change it to "Draft Sent", "Under Negotiation", 
etc., it wipes that counterparty's master from the list of executed masters.

How many times do we have to say this?!

Are we having your group meeting today?  Inquiring minds want to know...

Well, actually Tanya, your statement below isn't a truly correct statement.  
We have not consented to the Statoil/J. Aron assignment (in principal yet, in 
actuality, no).  We are off about 19 trades and have sent the Statoil people 
a list of the disputed trades to resolve.  Once we are in agreement about the 
trades, I will add a paragraph to their form of assignment to the effect that 
the assigned trades (be they physical or financial) will go under the 
respective J. Aron master we have in place for that product.  Only then can 
we move the trades...

	Tanya Rohauer
	05/09/2000 01:36 PM
		 
As we have consented to the assignment of the trades under the Statoil Energy 
Trading ISDA to JAron, could you tell me what the timeline will be for moving 
these transactions in TAGG/ERMS to JAron?

Thanks!

The date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the NYMEX sends us 
when they approve our exemptions.  Because we have so many commodities we are 
applying for now, and the form is quite lengthy, it took the NYMEX quite a 
while last year to approve our requests, which moved the date back to July 26 
(last year our renewals were due the 1st week of July).  So we've got a lttle 
more time to work on it.  I will probably start notifying the various group's 
that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the 
middle or toward the end of May.

	Trey Hardy
	05/09/2000 01:43 PM
		
When I was looking at last year's data, I noticed that the due date on last 
year's NYMEX financials was the end of June.  Did the due date get moved back 
to July?  Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks

Trey Hardy

   

I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.  They are due the end of 
July, so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier, since we 
always seem to need more time.

directions to Pastor Beth's house are attached.

Laura, is Steve getting the recipe from you or Pastor Beth?  Pastor Beth, 
I've got you coordinating with Matthias & Karen.

I've faxed the recipes to Karl & Ulf.  July Weller is the only one I need to 
assign a recipe.  I'm hoping she'll do one of the Gazpacho recipes since it's 
a little more complicated.  Everyone else I having doing double recipes.

I have opened the referenced counterparty to trade weather online.  However, 
they should continue to use the same special form of confirm that they are 
using offline until we get an ISDA Master in place with them.

We cannot move the trades until we agree to the assignment, which we have not 
done yet.  We are resolving the trades being assigned, so don't move the 
trades until you hear from me.  Bob Bowen has been working on this on the 
confirm desk side.

Yes, we will be having it at Pastor Beth's.  Do you need directions?  It's at 
7:00 pm.

At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Confidentiality Agreement.  If you have any questions or comments concerning 
the agreement please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark 
Taylor, Assisant General Counsel, at (713) 853-7459.  If the agreement meets 
with your approval, please have it executed by an authorized officer and 
return it to me via fax at (713) 646-3490.   

This Koch trade you sent me is a London based Credit counterparty, not a 
Houston counterparty so I have no information on it.  You are going to have 
to resolve this with London Legal, Edmund Cooper  who is an attorney in 
London at  011 44 20 7783 5382.  

Attached is a list of Japanese counterparties.  I need to respond to 
EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list.  The list is broken up 
into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online 
trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that 
we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has 
about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad 
names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).

You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?  They can 
potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at 
them like any new counterparty.  Saying that, what we really expect them to 
trade is the Singapore based group of products.

In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between 
ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing  new "umbrella" 
guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and 
also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options 
Inc. (a PG&E affiliate)  These new guarantees will cover all physical, 
financial and power transactions between the above parties.  I have sent them 
the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in 
the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.  Rod is 
resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.

In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to 
return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees:  (1) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power 
Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading 
Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT 
Canada.

I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. 
Prior Guarantees.

1.  Whenever we supersede and replace one Enron guaranty with another, we are 
supposed to have the "supersede and replace" language in the new guaranty.  
Is there some reason why it's not in there, and if we can't get it in at this 
late date, how are we going to make sure we don't have two live Enron 
guarantees out with the counterparty?

2.  Is there some reason one the state of Oregon is bolded in the guaranty?

Attached for signature is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the 
referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an 
ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need two executed copies since both parties 
have to execute the Guaranty.  This ISDA Master Agreement will supersede and 
replace an existing Master Agreement with this Counterparty, and this Enron 
Corp.Guaranty will supersede and replace the previous Enron Corp. Guaranty 
dated as of March 4, 1994.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of 
Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

I have lots of blanks on my approvals on the attached list for several 
European products.  If you know any of the answers, can you please just hand 
write them in and fax them back to me, or email a more recent list you might 
that addresses the European approvals.  Much thanks.

She didn't return my phone calls from yesterday either, so if you can go

I left a message for Mike Neves this a.m. to see if we could get together 
this morning to check on things so we can open the database up.  Meanwhile, 
what the confirmation desk could do is forward me an email for them and 
anyone from settlement that may want access to this database.  I am going to 
have to email people the link to get in.

Within the next few days (I hope!) we will be able to open the Master Swap 
Agreement Database, now called the Financial Trading Agreement Database, to 
people outside of Legal and Credit.  You will be able to use this database to 
verify master agreement information and special confirmation issues. 

Jeff, once we  have the data inputted, you will also be able to verify branch 
offices and adopted ISDA Definitions in the Master Agreement (that project is 
still in progress). 

Can you please send me a list of the people in your group who would like to 
have view access to this database.  I will have to email them the link.

Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow.  I'm 
looking forward to the cooler weather.  I got some good bargains on post 
winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about 
buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one 
sitting!

My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% 
done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer 
Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a 
while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like 
tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. 
plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little 
little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 
7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have 
to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, 
yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before 
they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot 
of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over 
Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds 
and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a 
bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.  
I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis 
fountain.  He's just lovely!

Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's 
painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real 
pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can 
start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of 
the 4th of July holiday.

You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to 
do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.  Now when you talk about 
things I can picture what you're talking about.

Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.  I'm 
looking forward to that.  I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of 
poor Willow.

Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there 
because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.  I'm sorry he didn't get a 
chance to see your car.  I was trying to describe it to him and I don't think 
I gave it justice.

It was good talking to you the other day!  I'll give you a call when I get 
back.

You're a star!

I understand either of you gentlemen can advise me on what legal issues, if 
any, we might have with trading the new Singapore online products with my US 
based counterparty list..?  Do we have any issues trading those products with 
counterparties incorporated in any specific country?

Attached please find referenced list.  A few notes:

No physical power or credit derivatives for any of these Japanese 
counterparties.  Re:  Bandwidth, as a general principle, what I'm hearing 
from the bandwidth lawyers is (1) for Japanese counterparties they can only 
trade the U.S. segment (which is currently the only segment we have online), 
and (2) for right now, we have 1 Netherlands and 2 German counterparties on 
the list, and they are still checking to get the scoop on those countries, so 
for right now I am shutting them down for bandwidth.

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
counterparty dated May 11, 2000.   A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.

I spoke to Harry Musikas in NYMEX Compliance this afternoon and he gave me 
verbal approval of 500 contracts for COB spot month for the next year, 
pending final approval of Bernie Purta (big boss at NYMEX).  We won't get the 
letter for about a week to 2 weeks, but I wanted to let you know.  I spoke to 
Mike Swerzbin and told him the same thing.  I'll pass on the approval letter 
and my revised list as soon as we get his approval letter.

No wonder you couldn't find it!  Keep looking, 'cause I guess when you can

Every time I've come by your office this morning, you've been on the phone so 
I hate to bug you when I know you are swamped but are we going to be able to 
do any more of the ISDA stuff today?  I have a conference call at 3:30 this 
afternoon that will be 1-2 hours and then I am flying home tomorrow so will 
be leaving the office around noon tomorrow.

I have passed on the confirmation termination letter you sent me to Melba 
Lozano on the Confirmation Desk for handling.

Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about 
doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us 
under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them.  
They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is 
attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and 
she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to 
Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit 
situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We 
will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit.
	Larry Gagliardi@ENRON
	05/11/2000 02:36 PM
		 
Tana, can you let me know if you can take care of this request from Valero?

this to the right place. Tana can be reached at 3-3399.

wilsonj@valero.com on 05/10/2000 09:40:12 AM
Thanks for your call this morning.  I was in the middle of legging some gas
cracks and had to go.

Before we begin trading with you, we need to execute an ISDA.  I am
attaching a copy of our standard schedule.  We have this agreement in place
with all of the major dealers; and so, in general, we will not accept
substantial changes to the agreement, particularly with regard to credit
terms.

Again,  thanks for your call, and I look forward to dealing with you in the
future.

spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.  She  
has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I 
am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and 
directors, which appears to have been approved.  The banking resolution went

(brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).  How about adoption of the trading 
policy?

I spoke to Greg Johnston, one of the Canadian lawyers who is currently

Imperial Oil Resources is an Alberta limited partnership.  All Canadian 
transactions are entered into with this counterparty.

Imperial Oil Resources Limited is the General Partner of Imperial Oil 
Resources.  We do not transact business with this entity.

EOL Team,

Please approve the above mentioned for online trading for financial oil and 
gas in the U.S. only.    

We have a Master Swap contract with these guys, and they are an ESP.  
However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM 
credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the 
amount of exposure above the credit line.  So, as a result, we want to 
approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able 
to complete any transactions.  The counterparty has requested approval, and 
Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see 
the stacks.  Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set 
a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts 
to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down.

If this is not possible, please ket me know so I can get back with Fred and 
the counterparty.

Thanks,

John

The ballots are due in New York on June 20, and there are no provisions made

due date.

Per conv. w/Anthony, we should expect 13 people.  We do not need to 
teleconference anyone in.  Anthony wanted the London Global Contracts people 
on the line, but I discussed it with Mark, and their forms and legal issues 
are so different from ours that I told Anthony that they need to contact 
London Legal if they would like a presentation.

We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross 
Border) effective as of 06/29/99.  Copies will be distributed.

Transaction."

Sorry for my hold up on this list.  I had an issue with the division/dba 
approvals that I needed to resolve with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor.  We 
will be issuing a policy (as soon as I draft it) about how to deal with 
divisions/dba's in the future.  For this Koch counterparty:

Per my conversation with Stephanie, I am provisionally approving this 
counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name 
gets amended to read as follows:

Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

If the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me 
know, I will talk to the Koch lawyer.  (FYI, this is the way we styled the 
ISDA Master Agreement, at the direction of the Koch lawyer.)

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
Counterparty dated May 12, 2000.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and 
Teresa Smith.

Luanne Geison at J. Aron left me a message that their guaranty is being

to us.

With respect to El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., this counterparty was on 
yesterday's list as an amended counterparty, but it is actually a new 
counterparty.  It should be approved for all products but power.

Melissa,  I still need to forward over the documents listed below.  Have you, 
or someone in your group, been able to track them down.

In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between 
ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing  new "umbrella" 
guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and 
also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options 
Inc. (a PG&E affiliate)  These new guarantees will cover all physical, 
financial and power transactions between the above parties.  I have sent them 
the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in 
the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.  Rod is 
resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.

In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to 
return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees:  (1) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power 
Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading 
Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT 
Canada.

I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. 
Prior Guarantees.

Per my conversation a minute ago with Leslie Hansen, El Paso Merchant Energy 
is OK to trade power, so I have amended the spreadsheet to reflect that 
change.

I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!

We are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for 
Keyspan with the guarantor being KeySpan Corporation d/b/a KeySpan Energy and 
the guaranteed parties being KeySpan Ravenswood Inc. and KeySpan Ravenswood 
Services.  I have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before.  
We've got Keyspan Energy Management, Inc. as a counterparty we sent a draft 
master to about a year ago.  Will these Ravenswood entities trade financial 
with us?  Do we need to add Keyspan Energy Management to the guaranty if that 
is indeed the Keyspan entity we are trading with?

By the way, what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on?  You Credit guys 
live high on the hog!  You must have a bigger budget than us!

I'm not exactly sure what your email is getting at.  No matter what the 
financial product is, if we have a financial master agreement in place we 
should tie the financial master to the product.

Anthony, in reply to your voicemail that you can't find the guarantees, 
you've got to have them somewhere there.  Maybe they're with some old Margie 
Wright files.  But neither Legal nor Credit would keep the original 
guarantees, so they've got to be somewhere there.

I would like to take the following time off:

Wednesday, May 31 - I need to leave at 3:00

My new house closing is on Monday June 5 at Partner's Title in the old Texas 
Commerce Bank Bldg.- they haven't set the time yet
I will be taking two days off in June to move into my new house - June 12 & 13

My old house sale closes on Monday, June 19 - also at Partner's Title - they 
haven't set the time yet

Let me know if there are any problems...

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by the Counterparty of the Floating Amount will be treated as a 
payment pursuant to a guaranty by the Counterparty of the obligations of Bob 
West Treasure, LLC to make payments pursuant to Section ___ of the 
[underlying Financing Agreement between Bob West Treasure and Royal Bank of 
Canada.]  The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is 
required to report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit 
relating to the Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, 
such party shall report such item consistent with the characterization set 
forth above and shall not take any position on any tax return or report 
relating to United States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with 
such characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they 
have agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income 
tax purposes may be inconsistent with the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for other tax purposes and for accounting, regulatory or other 
purposes.  The provisions of this Section are not intended to affect the 
manner in which the parties report the Transaction for such other purposes, 
or the interpretation of the provisions of the Confirmation and the rights 
and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, for any purposes.

Per instructions from Brant Reves in Credit dated 5/15/98 (a copy of which 
has just been provided to me by Global Contracts), please inactivate the 
Master Agreement [ERMS] with the referenced counterparty.  It appears Aurora 
Natural Gas Systems LLC is a dba for Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.  We have an 
ISDA Master Agreement dated 1/20/00 in place with Aurora Natural Gas, LLC and 
all financial business should be transacted under such ISDA Master.  Further, 
per Brant's instructions, all trades done with Aurora Natural Gas Systems, 
LLC should be moved to the correct legal entity, Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.

I was just speaking to Edmund Cooper about various swap matters, and he 
wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries (for ECT 
International) in the Master Swap Agreement Database.  Someone went into one 
of his and added a note that the Trade Option Exemption was deleted when it 
wasn't.  If you think something is in error or needs to be added, please 
consult with him.  Thanks

It's about 1 1/2 hour drive outside of the City.  I think if you wanted to 
ride you would only be able to do it weekends.  Are you still interested?

Edmund,

Below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a 
master swap agreement executed.  With this email Global Counterparty can open 
the counterparty. We then immediately send the master swap agreement and 
other documentation down in the attached memo.    If we get the master in 
signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation  (like the 
guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental) we hold off on sending 
the email.  Sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on 
incumbency certificates (which we do not consider critical in most 
circumstances) so we may send the email, send down whatever executed 
documentation we have, while we wait on the certificates.  We used to wait to 
send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed, 
but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master.  Does 
this make sense?...

I am now going to look for one with special instructions...

Below is my standard memo to Global Contract with any kind of executed 
documents I send down to them.  Also, a new procedral thing that is evolving 
here in Houston, we used to send Global Contracts the originally executed 
guarantees, but Credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all 
guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future (with a 
copy in the Global Contract file)

Thank you,

I got back from vacation late Friday.  Our whole group got bumped from the 
flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.  Not a 
bad deal!  But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was 
exhausted.  Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover 
(and clean from my construction work).

I had a really nice time.  Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except 
for the flight out of Munich.  We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, 
Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.  My favorite 
time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to 
make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do 
anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our 
hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast 
and dinner included!  Such a deal!  

I got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things 
left.  The garden is at 85%.  My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant 
while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.

I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I 
think (if the painter is done).  They are calico cats.  I haven't named them 
yet.

What's going on with you?  Are they working you to death?  Any fun things 
going on?  

We are ready to open the old "Master Swap Agreement Database", now called the 
"Financial Trading Agreement Database" to people outside Legal and Credit.  
Can you provide me a list of the people in your group that would like access 
so I can email them the agent to open the database.  Much thanks!

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Susan,

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we 
have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you 
know anything.

Thanks,
Joe

How about adding the drop down for bandwidth trading?

I asked Credit to put the referenced counterparty on the re-approval list for 
financial because momentarily we hope to get the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in from the Counterparty and if certain things don't happen when I open them 
up they will have a cow!!

1.  When I approve them to trade financial online we need to make sure they 
are coded for having the master swap agreement in place.  They are insistent 
that they do not see the GTC and that the confirms and procedures agreed to 
in the master apply.

2.  All US and Canadian financial transactions, whether online or offline, 
should roll up under the master.

As soon as we get the executed ISDA Master Agreement in I will send an email.

I thank you and I know Sara Shackleton thanks you...!!!

I am still waiting for responses on the 5/30/00 list.  I hope to have it to 
you shortly.

Thanks, as usual!!

restricted by credit

Today's list:  

None of the following are authorized since restricted by credit:

Midcoast Marketing, Inc.

Reliant Energy Gas Transmission Company

Thanks!

I have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the 
approved swap forms there.  The subdirectory is called "Swaps" and there are 
two sub-subdirectories under there called "Current Forms" and "Old Forms".  I 
hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms.

Also, by popular acclaim, we are doing away with the old numerical naming 
system for forms like 2101a, 2101b, and giving them  names like 
isda-multicurrency, isda-local currency, industrial-u.s. (was 2103.doc), 
industrial-canadian, etc..  I hope this also makes it easier to find forms.

I am also moving forms we frequently use  located mainly in my directory, but 
also in other people's directories, into the atty.fms bank.  If there is a 
form you would like me to move in that I haven't, please let me know.  This 
should make the forms available to users outside the Houston office. 

To the U.K. and Singapore:  We are going through a form revision process here 
in Houston and when we are done I will send you clean and blacklined copies 
of the changes to you for your review. 

FYI, we are now executing Services Agreements, and it is my undertanding that 
Dave Samuels will maintain the files of the originally executed copies until 
I am given further instruction.  As with all the online documents I am 
getting executed on your behalf, I will maintain a copy in our files also.

We have received the executed Information Services Agreement dated May 22, 
2000 between Energy Argus Incorporated and Enron NetWorks LLC.  The original 
is being sent to Dave.

We have received the executed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement dated 
5/24/00 with the referenced party.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and 
Mike Danielson.

We have a new paralegal in our group, Samantha Boyd, she just started 
Monday.  Can you get her Master Swap Agreement access.  Thanks!

I am going to have to leave the Group Meeting a little early tomorrow.  The 
online team has scheduled a new employee training for tomorrow and at 10:30 
am Tom Moran and I are going to give a presentation on online approval 
procedures.

Please note the following on the 6/5/00 list:

We are shutting down Aquila Risk Management Corporation for all financial 
trading effective today.  All financial trading should be done out of 
Utilicorp United Inc.  This counterparty was on the original approval list, 
and I previously had them shut down for financial trading.  Credit will put 
them on tonight's list, meanwhile, we need to open them up to trade all 
financial immediately.

I know you are busy, but you need to send out your email about the signed 
master as soon as possible, so we can open up Utilicorp to trade financial.  
Brant can only open them up from Credit's perspective, I have to open them up 
from Legal, but they will still not be able to trade only until Global 
Contract ties the counterparty to the master, and they cannot do that until 
they get your email.  Thanks.

At Stephanie's request, I am approving the following three counterparties to 
transact Enron power SALES only prior to these counterparties coming out on 
tonight's Credit approval list (when we will do the full approvals):

The three new counterparties are:    

GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Pennsylvania

GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Metropolitan 
Edison Company

GPU Service, Inc., as authorized agent for and on behalf of Jersey Central

I reviewed the counterparties in our Financial Trading Database and located 
17 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross-checked that 
list against my Online Trading Counterparty List and located the 6 
counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade 
financial power and/or who have some type of restriction in place on the type 
of financial power transactions they can enter into:

1.  The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options
2.  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power 
transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps, 
swing swaps and options
3.  Phibro, Inc. - can only do natural gas, crude oil or oil product energy 
prices swap, put & call options.  Per my discussions with Tom, this 
counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty 
because they want to do financial power.  They have a really old form of 
agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial 
transactions.  I spoke to Mark Taylor about this and he said if they want to 
do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an 
ISDA.  I am going to talk to Credit about this.  They will definitely not be 
able to trade financial power by Monday...
4.  PXRE Corporation - weather only
5.  Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation - weather only
6.  Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited - weather only

Michael is the person.  Keep me posted if you don't get access.

How are you?  How goes the weight training?  Don't be a stranger...

In my absence on Monday and Tuesday, can you forward the counterparty 
approval lists to Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, and she will 
forward them on to my distribution, so we can at least get people reviewing 
the lists while I am out.  Much thanks!

On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for 
physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my 
discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up 
for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC 
approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to 
determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved 
by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open 
them up for power.  US emissions has been opened. 

P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, 
talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan 
Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract.

Attached is the referenced Annex B.  Call me if I can be of further help.

Dan,

I just wanted to let you know how to proceed on getting the agreement signed, 
since I will be out Monday and Tuesday.

Samantha Boyd is a new paralegal in our Group and she will coordinate getting 
it signed.  Her phone no. is 853-9188.  I understand you need it signed by 
Monday since you are meeting with Continental Tuesday.

As we discussed, we are incorporating EnronOnline LLC today.  As soon as we 
hear from Deb Korkmas (a paralegal that handles our corporate matters) that 
the company has been incorporated you can tell Continental that they can sign 
the agreement and return it to us via fax (have them fax it to Samantha's 
attention at fax:  (713) 646-3490).  Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will 
get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen 
or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in).  Either of them can 
sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice 
President.  After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to 
Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).

If the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement, they will have to talk 
to Mark directly.  His phone no. is 853-3399.

You'll have to take that personally with Ms. Heard.  For you, it would have 
much more personal impact than "Most Favored Nation" status.  I would 
certainly want to stay on Marie good side.  Though I know it is tough to 
compete with sweet Russell...

	John Suttle

Per our discussion when I was in London, we ordered you  a box of blue files 
and sent them to you (for your original deal files since you said you 
couldn't get those types of files in England).  One of our assistants got a 
call from what I guess must be Meagan and she (Meagan) said she was sending 
the files back because it wasn't what she wanted.  So if you do want the blue 
files you might want to intervene with Meagan before the files cross the 
Atlantic again.  We would, of course, be able to use the files here, so no 
big deal.

I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday of next week.  In my 
absence, Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, will forward the 
Counterparty Approval Lists to you once she receives them from Credit.  
Please return any responses you might have to me.  Thanks!

I just spoke to Mark Taylor and he has requested that we be more specific 
about the nature of the project we are working on in our confidentiality

 You forwarded to me a letter from Enron Corp. to the above vendor 
authorizing the use of a subcontractor by the name of Jason Yang.

The letter is non-specific as to name and title but since the work is for the 
Online Project, I would imagine that Philippe Bibi would be the appropriate 
person.  

I have not submitted the letter to Philippe for signature for two reasons:  

(1) We do not have the original Agreement for Project Services.  I don't know 
who executed it but it is not in our files. 
(2) There are actually a couple of standard subcontractor agreements that we 
ask the Contractor and Sub-Contractor to execute.  I am attaching electronic 
copies to this e-mail and printed copies to the hard copy which I am 
returning to you along with the original letter.  

If we find the person (Corporate Officer) who signed the original Agreement 
for Project Services, we should have that person sign all of these documents 
and then formally transmit them to the vendor.  We need the original 
agreement before we can proceed.

Please call me if I can be of help.     

The subcontractor agreements are attached below.  gene 

  

I sent you an earlier email about the blue files.  Now Erica has received 
back the three hole punch I ordered for you (so you could insert paper into 
the notebooks I have prepared for you), as well as a request for redweld 
manila folders (instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you).  Can 
you work out what supplies you want from us.  We are happy to order whatever 
you like, but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what 
the supplies are worth.  Thanks.

 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:   June 8, 2000

Counterparty:   IDACORP Energy Solutions, L.P.

Transactions:   Approved for all products except:   foreign exchange and pulp 
and paper

PLEASE NOTE:  This Counterparty is a multi-branch party and may transact 
business out of its Houston and Boise, Idaho offices.

    The Counterparty has three (3) Local Business Days to accept or dispute  
a Confirmation.

Susan D. Flynn

Yeah, we also need to provide copies of the signed resolutions to Ted Murphy, 
so he knows what's approved, so he then knows who does a trade outside of the 
approval.

We also then need to update the index to our corporate resolutions binders 
and substitute the revised resolution in our binders so the binders always 
contain the most current resolution.

I had a conversation with Ed Staub over at Duke today, and he now wants to 
get an agreement in place between Duke and ENA.  I mentioned to him our 
agreement between ENA and ECC that would allow us to trade both entities 
under the same master, and he was not interested in trading in that manner, 
he wants separate agreements in place with both companies, obviously, 
mirroring the terms of the master we are putting in place with ECC, just 
changing it for any cross-border issues.  I told him I would run it by our 
Credit Dept.

We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX 
for 2000.  In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an 
updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary Companies.

Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help with this!

We got a call from the NYMEX today, and they received another Access terminal 
that appears to be slated for Enron.  My understanding is that we have the 
five terminals that I ordered.  You do have your two in Portland, don't you?

Please confirm that for me.  Thanks!

We have received the executed Second Amendment to Guaranty Agreement dated as 
of June 9, 2000.  This amendment changed the guaranty of Formosa Plastics 
Corporation, USA ("Guarantor") with respect to the physical transactions with 
Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. and financial transactions with Neumin 
Production Co. to an unlimited guaranty.  The original guaranty amendment 
will be sent to Credit.

Per my conv. a minute ago with Maryann Friel, they will be fedexing the 
documents out to us tonight!

You need to contact whoever it is you are speaking to at PPL and tell them we 
have never received a request to assign the financial deals, and if they 
would like to send us one we will take a look at it.

Susan,

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we 
have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you 
know anything.

Thanks,
Joe

We have finally received the executed Termination Agreement for the two Koch 
physical trades done in error on EOL (which have already rolled off the 
books!).  The deal nos. are EOL Nos. 103992 and 104018.  I am sending the 
original to Bob Bowen.

We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce assigned two physical trades to CIBC World 
Markets Plc.  Those two deal Nos are EOL deal no 137945 and 149472.  The 
originals will be sent to Bob Bowen.

To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information:

1.  The correct legal name of the counterparty
2.  Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential 
information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential 
information).  Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since 
it is written more in our favor.
3.  The nature and/or use of the information being provided.
4.  The address of the counterparty
5.  The phone and fax number of the counterparty

Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.

The Power Desk directed me to give John Galperin, our broker with Salomon, 
Smith Barney a call to get the May Entergy volumes.  John spoke to the NYMEX 
and they came back with a figure of -0- contracts traded in May, with a total 
of 34 Entergy contracts traded so far for 2000 (all months).

Carol,

1. We have set up the Master User from Aquila Risk under Utilicorp.  We do 
not require any further paperwork from them, however, we do need them to set 
up their sub-users.  I am going to follow up with Angela Webber at Utilicorp 
tomorrow to make sure that sub users are set up.

2. I will notify you once sub-user accounts have been set up and then wait 
for your instructions as to when we will shut Aquila Risk down for trading.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465

   Carol St Clair                06/19/2000 11:49 AM

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my 
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password 
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set 
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he 
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those 
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the 
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from 
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and 
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is 
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but 
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you 
know when that date is.

Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.

I need to send out the attached memo ASAP to all employees of Enron North

If we are going to vote on the NYMEX demutualization plan the ballots are due 
tomorrow, so today is your last possible day to get them out, since it only 
provides for mail in ballots, no faxes this time.   I check and both Mark and 
Kevin are in, for right now!

Done.

I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate 
our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and 
online transactions.  Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the 
physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in 
it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is 
faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.  PP&L tells me 
that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have 
not received such approval.

With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any 
particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in 
doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done 
with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if 
Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).  It 
seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.

Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these 
consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with 
assigning the online account over...

Wouldn't you like to know which of the two Susan's gave her notice today!?!

I called Haedicke to check on the status of his Rappaport conversation, and 
he told me he hadn't had a chance to talk to him yet but to go ahead and fax 
in the ballots, which I have done (I got Kevin's too). 

I had to order a set of the ISDA Japanese documents for John Viverito, who 
will be leaving for Japan soon, so if anyone needs a copy I have them.  Also, 
London sent me a copy of the Amsterdam Power Exchange Rules, which I don't 
think anyone will need, but if you do, I have those too.

Do you only want the form of Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto, 
or do you also want a pro forma Canadian ISDA Schedule.  Also, I would expect 
that since you are dealing with Canadian municipalities you would want a form 
that include the special municipal provisions, which are somewhat lengthy?

	Greg Johnston

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Attached are the referenced lists.  On the 6/19/00 list for Sithe Power 
Marketing, LP, they were on the original approval list, and since they are 
coming through again for SO2, and since I'm not sure if we had SO2 on the 
original list, I open them up for it just in case.  Also, I opened them up 
for financial, since it appears they have now met the eligible swap 
participant requirements, even tho' Credit is still not opening them up for 
financial.

I just wanted to check for one of our British attorneys who is coming into 
town next month to confirm he is registered for a seminar.  Do you have Mark 
Elliott registered for Derivatives I on August 8 and 9.  Can you confirm this

I would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few 
questions.  First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, 
we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep 
in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry 
about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is 
always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master 
would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason 
to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.

Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to 
mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular 
out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of 
Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it 
Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.  Will 
they be financially trading separately under those departments?  And if so 
should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?

Anything else special you think I need to mention?

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between Continental 

Just a followup note:

We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original 
incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have 
been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of 
using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I 
think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to 
the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my 
question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, 
to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).

FYI,

I spoke to my contact in the NYMEX Marketing Group and she told me that the 
NYMEX demutualization vote passed 140-11.

The draft of the email you sent Mark looks OK in terms of its content.  Is 
there any way I will be able to get some form of a confirmation reflecting 
that it was sent to all the offices in my prior emails?

Per the email below, please note that if you haven't been sending your 
original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the 
future.  Please forward this email on to other members of your group that 
might be responsible for filing original guarantees.

 I have talked with everyone involved, Anthony Campos, Mark Thorne, etc., and

they can be briefed and entered into our Credit Agg System.  If you have any 
questions please give me a call.

you.  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'll do that first thing this 
morning.  As you recall, we sent them the OMLX's form for signature a few

customary it is to negotiate this with the OMLX?  Anyway, we'll take a look

Does this include original Enron Corp. guarantees?  On the physical side, we 
have the counterparty sign the Enron Corp. document and therefore have an 
original.  Let me know.

Thanks,

Per the email below, please note that if you haven't been sending your 
original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the 
future.  Please forward this email on to other members of your group that 
might be responsible for filing original guarantees.

Tana,

 I have talked with everyone involved, Anthony Campos, Mark Thorne, etc., and 
everyone is in agreement that original guarantees should now come to credit.  
If you could please, just make sure that they come to my attention so that 
they can be briefed and entered into our Credit Agg System.  If you have any 
questions please give me a call.

Thanks

This is what we discussed a few weeks ago
Just a followup note:

We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original 
incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have 
been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of 
using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I 
think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to 
the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my 
question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, 
to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).

Just a reminder that I hope to be out this afternoon (as of this morning my 
old house closing is set for 3:00 pm, keep your fingers crossed it goes 
through this time!).   Also, I have morning jury duty tomorrow.

You are abviously a man of clear and discerning vision!

5.  Sheetrock over their livingroom bookcase at Nancy & Peter's.
6.  Paint outdoor pipes same color as house.
7.  I spoke to Bob Goss, they took the light fixture cover out of my back 
stairwell (it's in the ceiling) and lost it.  Bob asked if you could replace 
it for him and send him the bill.
8.  Additional plumbing (1) airconditioning pipe, and (2) washing machine 
hoses in back of garage, and cover open drain near door to garage bathroom 
plumbing.

That should do it!  

Marie,

Obviously, you are not "in the know".  The word on the Enron streets is that 
Yao is brokering the peace in Bosnia, and that is why he is too busy to call 
his old friends!

Given the proliferation of new products and the potential of Enron Net Works 
to continue this trend, I am soliciting guidance as to the proper 
administration of the Risk Management Policy regarding employee trading.  

The following is the verbatim language from the Policy:

"Section VII.  Miscellaneous 
   Employee Trading.  No employee may engage in the trading of any Position 
for the benefit of any party other than an Enron Company (whether for theri 
own account of thr the account of any third party) where such Position 
relates to (i) any financial instrument, security, financial asset or 
liability whch falls within  such employee's responsibility at an Enron 
Compay or (ii) any other commodity included in any Commodity Group."

Administration of this policy has been limited to the efforts of Mark Taylor 
and Tana Jones in the Legal Department primarily consisting of employees 
"confessing" to trading certain products.    In the past, if the product has 
been one that Enron does not trade, the employee is told that it is ok.  If 
it is a product that we do trade, then they are informed to comply with 
policy.    Restrictions on the trading of financial instruments, such as 
equities, interest rates and foriegn exchange have been limited to those that 
are currently managing those books for an Enron Company or those who might 
have access to information that was not in the public domain.

Generally, we have found that people have traded yen, S&P futures, metals and 
agricultural products.   Now that we have authorized the trading of a wide 
variety of agricultural products and metals, we may need to advise employees 
not to trade them (immediately, soon, never???).   We may also consider 
changing the policy or altering our enforcement methods.

Please advise your guidance as to how to proceed.

Ted

I am currently working on an audit of the Risk Controls Group sanctioned by

what my basic objectives were.
I was hoping that you could point me in the right direction, or perhaps let 
me know someone in your group

I certainly appreciate all of your help.
If you have any questions I can be reached at x31684.

Marie,

I think you are mistaken.  I was watching E, the Entertainment Channel, last 
night, and Joan Rivers was doing her best and worsed dressed review at 
Cannes.  I noticed this incredibly handsome and debonair man, dressed all in 
black from head to toe, a shy smile, with eyes hidden behind dark glasses, 
and a lovely beauty on each of his arms.  I thought, "could it be...might it 
be...?!".  And it was...it was truly he.  I'm sure of it!

With respect to Utilicorp, I cannot amend their profile yet to open them for 
financial until I get the word that everything is set up and ready to go.  We 
do have the financial master in, so as soon as we figure out how we want to 
open the accounts, I can send my email.

Let me know on MRT what you find out.  When can I see your house?

Below is slightly revised language to be included in the ISDA agreement being

documentation.  Please call with any follow up.  Steve.

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by [Enron Re] of the [Floating - this assumes that Enron Re is paying 
such amount] Amount will be treated as a payment pursuant to a guaranty by 
[Enron Re][of the obligations of Bob West Treasure, LLC to make payments 
pursuant to Section ___ of the [underlying Financing Agreement between Bob 
West Treasure and Royal Bank of Canada - this needs to be clarifed - is the 
payment related to the RBC loan or the insurance payment by EFR?  If it is 
the RBC loan then this clause is appropriate but if, alternatively, it is the 
EFR insurance payment, then the reference needs to be changed accordingly.]]  
The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is required to 
report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to the 
Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, such party shall 
report such item consistent with the characterization set forth above and 
shall not take any position on any tax return or report relating to United 
States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with such 
characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they have 
agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income tax 
purposes may be different from the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for non-United States federal income tax purposes and for 
accounting, regulatory or other purposes.  The provisions of this Section are 
not intended to affect the manner in which the parties report the Transaction 
for such other purposes, or the interpretation of the provisions of the 
Confirmation and the rights and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, 
for any purposes.

I am trying to track down in London the author of an ISDA Schedule on the 
deal between ECT and the ETOL Trust.  The top of the Schedule says "Milbank 
Draft" and the document # on the botton says LN1: #20030058v5.  Robina 
Barker-Bennett in Treasury left Mark Taylor an email about this, and I left 
her a voicemail trying to track down the document, but haven't heard back.  I 
would think the document was prepared by one of your lawyers.  Mark needs the 
computer document so we can do a blackline against another agreement here in 
Houston.

Can you see what you can do to track it down for me.  I'd appreciate it.

Stephanie rightly pointed out that I was confusing Utilcorp w/Pacific Gas and 
Electric.  Just call me Roseannaroseannatana!

except pulp & paper.

As Frank indicated below, below is a new bandwidth product being introduced 
online.  Frequently, if we have a new product and it is close enough in 
character to another product, we just mirror the approvals we have already 
given to the mirrored product.  Does this strategy work for you, or are there 
any issues we are unfamiliar with that would require us to review this 
product in a totally different manner?
	Frank L Davis
	06/26/2000 01:20 PM
		 
Below is the description of the new bandwidth product type that is rolling 
out shortly.  My initial thoughts are to copy the profiles from the existing 
physical bandwidth product types.  Please send me any comments as soon as 
possible.

Thanks!!!!

Frank

Commercial is rolling out the following new product for Bandwidth.  It is the 
same set-up as the products for Bandwidth currently set-up.

Commodity:  DW-48
Currency:  USD
Default UOM:  DSO Miles
Country:  USA

Description:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. ("EBS") 
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantity 
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of 
DSO's per DW-48 is 32,256.  The price shall be as submitted by the 
Counterparty via the Website. Any party entering into a Transaction to buy or 
sell Bandwidth Units from or to EBS shall be responsible for connecting to 
the Demarcation Point located at each Market Pooling Point in order to take 
physical delivery of such Bandwidth.  In order to achieve such connectivity, 
a party may incur costs and expenses and may additionally be required to 
execute certain documentation.

and 10, so you don't need to worry about it.  I will be taking the class too!

We are trying to track you down an office.  Our floor is completely full 
right now, between permanent people and contract workers, so we're having to 
do some shifting.  They are getting ready to rebuild the floor, maybe build 
some more internal offices or make some smaller, because of the lack of 
space.  Something y'all can relate to there in London!

Is Global Finance Gary Hickerson's Group?  Credit is the only group besides 
us that gets full access, anyone else gets more limited access.

Mike,

Mary Cook is a new attorney that joined our Group yesterday.  Can you get her 
full access to the referenced database, and let us know when such access is 
granted.

Thanks!

Per my conversation with Credit, the referenced counterparty has now provided 
the letter of credit that will enable them to become an eligible swap 
participant.  Therefore, I am opening them up to trade financial.  They will 
come through as an amendment on tonight's list.

Per our discussion, attached is my rough draft of the Legal Script.  Just to 
save you the time and effort of having people read for the part, may I 
suggest Julia Roberts to play my role in the film.  She's already got this 
paralegal thing down with the Erin Brokovitch role...

P.S. I almost have the 6/22 list done.  There is one more counterparty 
credit/power is working on.  And I have the 6/23 and 6/26 lists done, I just 
have to write them up.  I'll have them to you soon.

Mike,

Can you grant George Hope with the Online Team, view access only to the Legal 
Online Trading Database.  Can you let us know when his approval comes in.  
Thanks!

We have received the executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with Belco 
Oil & Gas Corp. dated as of July 8, 1999.  We have also received the executed 
Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein the trades under the existing 
Belco Operating Corp. Master Energy Price Swap Agreement will be assigned to 
the Belco Oil & Gas Corp. master.  No trading will continue under the Belco 
Operating Corp. master.  The two active Belco masters will be the Belco Oil & 
Gas Corp. master and the Belco Energy Corp. master.

Copies will be distributed.

I am still waiting on approval for MRT Energy Marketing Company (and my list 
from 6/22), pending on your determination as to whether it is a division or a 
subsidiary of Reliant Energy Services, Inc.

Stacy,

Jeff asked me to pass this on to you for handling:

Tom Nuelle (pronounced "Nelly"), Risk Manager at BP Amoco called, and said 
they need to assign a physical trade from one Amoco entity to another.  The 
trade was done w/Amoco Energy Trading and they need to assign it to Amoco 
Canada.  It's a Nov-March,EOL Deal no. 265080.  Tom's phone # is 
281/366-4034.  Tom Moran from Credit had no problem moving the trade.

I would be glad to send him the link if you can send me the link.

If George only needs read access, you can just send him the database link and 
he should be ready to go (remember -  we opened the system up to everyone).  
Let me know if you need antyhing else.

provided already, my apologies for asking again.  Thanks.  Sara

Please shut down the referenced cpy for financial trading.  I just found out 
they are a Bermuda corporation and I need to see if we can do financial 
transactions under Bermuda law.

Anytime!

Thanks!

I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware,  
since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US 
segment of bandwidth.  Since this is the only segment we are trading online 
yet, this isn't an issue.  But as we move forward and add more segments we 
are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been 
open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based 
segments as we add them in the future.

Please add Carol St. Clair to the Credit Watch Lists for Houston and Canada.

Attached is the script revised w/Mark Taylor's comments.

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
Counterparty dated June 18, 2000.  Copies will be be sent Dave Samuels and 
Teresa Smith.

Please call me with any comments or changes.

Attached is a list containing the new MG counterparties.  You can see it by 
clicking on the second tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet  where it 
says "MG New Cpys".  Ignore the first tab.  I am told by London Legal that 
our deadline for responding to this list is Monday.  

Bandwidth team, in talking to London Legal, per my current understanding, the 
only two jurisdictions approved to trade bandwidth are the US and UK.  We've 
got Japan and Bermuda approved to trade US segment only.  So unless we hear 
otherwise from you, it is our intention to give all the other counterparties 
"read only" access.

Herewith revised approval list.  

Tana will revert with an update on US counterparties some of which will need 
to be switched to read-only.

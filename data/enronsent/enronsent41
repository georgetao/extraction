I am not sure if you had a chance to contact Louise Kitchens or Andy Zipper 
regarding the Energy Bar Association program, but I just wanted to check.? If 
neither of them are available, has Mark Haedicke returned from travel?? If 
so, would you recommend that I give him a call.

I know that you are very busy and greatly appreciate your assistance.

As the office construction process continues, your offices will be among the 
next to be demolished & reconstructed.  While the current timetable is not 
firm, it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 5th to 
the 13th of October (this means the move may take place during the ENA 
offsite).  I just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could 
begin the packing process.  Joya Davis will have details of your new (in some 
cases temporary) office locations, can help with obtaining boxes and will 
schedule the actual move.

Your new offices will be ready in a week or so.  We anticipate your moves 
will take place over the weekend of September 29.  Joy Davis will coordinate 
your moves and can help with obtaining boxes, etc.  

Sorry - forgot to cc you on this one.

If you look at the attached list we are due to make a lot of these dates in 
the next two weeks.  The biggest problem in Europe is probably that Edmund is 
obviously out of the office and there are no dates even for his.

These delays are causing chicken and egg problems with the metals customers.  
We can't mail if there are no pas etc.  The big metals roll-out is in London 
first week in October so we do need them by then,

If there are re-prioritisation issues please contact Bruce Garner who needs 
them for that week.

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Dear Shari,

Please be advised that Enron is still holding a letter of credit No. 7403213
in the amount of $7,000,000.

This letter of credit was provided by Palladium Insurance as credit support
for transactions which Enron terminated.

We request that Enron immediately return the letter of credit by overnight
to Bank of America at the following address:

 Bank of America
Insurance Division
231 South LaSalle Street
Chicago, Illinois  60697

Attn: Mr. James Horning

We would appreciate your confirmation of this action by return email or fax.

Yours sincerely,

Andy McComb

Yes, unfortunately, we aren't going to get ours until the 5th.  No 
explanation was given.  We may get the numbers a day or so ahead of time but 
I haven't gotten them yet.  We should set up a time to do your review in the 
next day or so, also.  

Thanks for all of the recent forwarded messages - they have all been mine.  
Sorry for not getting back to you sooner but I've been out of town.

Any hope of  a time for Lisa?  Please get in touch with her and let her know 
the situation.

Rick Shapiro has asked that I coordinate with you on CFTC issues since I'll 
be handling government affairs matters for Enron Global Markets and Enron

Would it be possible to meet sometime this week (or early next week) to talk 
about this?   I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday of this week, and 
all of next week.   Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to meeting you.

Sheri -

I don't remember being consulted about sending these documents by e-mail (but 
that doesn't mean it didn't happen - just that I don't remember it).  It 
sounds like a valid concern - any reason we can't just send people to the web 
site and ask them to print out the relevant PA?

Mark

	Sheri Thomas
	10/03/2000 10:05 PM
		 
Mark -
Now that my responsibilities have been increased to include both EnronOnline 
and Clickpaper, something was brought to my attention that I am concerned 
about.  Clickpaper has been instructed not to send password applications to 
customers via e-mail.  This is something we have been doing since the 
inception of EnronOnline.  The concern is that customers will alter the 
language in the agreement, sign  and return it to us - hopefully, this will 
not happen, but could be a valid concern.  I am hoping you can shed some 
light on the original decision that was made to allow sending the PAs to 
customers electronically.  One solution that we could implement in the future 
is to send the file to the customer in .pdf format; however, the customer 
will need the applicable software to launch the program (we could include a 
link to download this).  The immediate solution is to discontinue this 
practice until I have discussed it with you.  I know you are out of the 
office until Monday, and I am out the rest of the week as well.  Please let 
me know your thoughts when you return.

Thanks!
Sheri

At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates
reportedly compared the
computer industry with the auto industry and stated
"if GM had kept up
with the technology like the computer industry has, we
would all be
driving $25 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued
a press release
stating: If GM had developed technology like
Microsoft, we would all be
driving cars with the following characteristics:

l. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash
twice a day.

2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road,
you would have to
buy a new car.

3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for
no reason.  You
would have to pull over to the side of the road, close
all of the
windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the
windows before
you
could proceed.  For some reason you would simply
accept this.

4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left
turn would cause
your

car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case
you would have to
reinstall the engine.

5. Only one person at a time could use the car unless
you bought
"CarNT,"
but then you would have to buy more seats.

6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the
sun, was
reliable,
five times as fast and twice as easy to drive- but
would run on only
five percent of the roads.

7. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning
lights would all
be replaced by a single "General Protection Fault"
warning light.

8. New seats would force everyone to have the same
sized butt.

9. The airbag system would ask "are you sure" before
deploying.

10. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car
would lock you out

and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously
lifted the door
handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio
antenna.

11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a
deluxe set of
Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even
though attempting to
delete this option would immediately cause the car's
performance to
diminish by 50% or more.

12. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers
would have to learn
to drive all over again because none of the controls
would operate in
the same manner as the old car.

13. You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the
engine off.

Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation
by the Justice
Dept.

Gentlemen, 

I met with Craig Young (MG US) last week, who is keen to progress metals 
business with large US corporates (e.g. Anheuser Busch), on the following 
basis:

o Assume ENA and US Corporate are existing parties to ISDA/Credit Support 
Documents (the "Master").

o ENA and US Corporate would agree to expand range of OTC products to include 
OTC metal derivatives under the Master.  The principals to the metals trades 
would therefore be the US Corporate and ENA.  These trades would however be 
"arranged" by MG London Inc. (an FCM) as "arranger" in the US for ENA.

o Enron Metals Limited (EML) from London would agree to provide metals prices 
to ENA and/or MG London Inc. in the US, and in return receive a commission 
from MG London Inc.

o ENA would back-to-back OTC metals derivatives with EML via an intra-group 
ISDA Master.

Look forward to your views.

Thanks.
Justin

In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online

will be providing to the Online team.  Before we send this out, I have been 
asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or 
Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we 
need to make to the list.

We should get together with the right tax person/people - maybe Jeff can 
figure this out.

ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided 
with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of 
Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
week to discuss this.

Stephanie Harris called back this morning to say that Jim will not be in the 
office on any of our proposed dates.  She suggests we try the first week in 
March.  Any possibilties there?

Based on the current schedule of work here in the office we have two sets of 
dates that would work for Andrea to visit Houston to meet with Jim Derrick. 
She could be in Houston late Monday morning, Feb. 15, and would leave Tuesday 
night, Feb. 16, or arrive late Thursday morning, Feb. 25, and leave Friday 
evening, Feb. 26.  Could you find out if Jim Derrick and Mark Haedicke will
be available to meet with Andrea on any of these dates?  Thanks.

I'd be happy to take them if they're available.

Mike -

I have trouble getting some of the e-mails sent to me from Buenos Aires but 
not all.  I received this one from you today, one on the 9th and one on Sept. 
25th.

mtaylo1@enron.com.

I light of the fact that we have two legal documents that have to be drafted, 
finalized and approved in a matter of days I have requested Andrea take full 
responsibility and accountability for the successful management of this 
process and resulting team effort. 

For EOL Argentina implementation not to be delayed further I am requesting 
the following:

Natural Gas GTC be finalized and approved by this Friday. 

Power GTC will need all of your cooperation to work through the current 
issues and to deliver a document for presentation as a final draft by this 
Friday. Targeted submission for approval would be reserved for Monday of next 
week

Andrea will coordinate from here on. Please make yourselves available to work 
on this effort in that I do consider it one of our highest commercial 
responsibilities.

Thank you for your efforts.

Greg,

Here is the ETA version in my directory.  I think a few minor changes may 
have been made (e.g. EnronOnline LLC is now the Enron party) and the 
definitive version is on the website.  You can access it there if you have a 
guest user ID.  If you need an ID, just let me know and we'll have the EOL 
people issue one for you.  I'm also attaching an early version of the 
Password Application (current versions also online and accessible even 
without an ID) since it may cover a few issues not addressed in the ETA.  I 
usually think of the two pieces as one agreement.

Also, I am currently reviewing three Canadian power financial products that

Are you guys around this weekend?  Any particular plans?  

Initial thoughts - 

Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, 
and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron 
Japan?

Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the 
word "ordinary" or maybe the entire phrase "in the ordinary course of its 
business"?

Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or "no action" type 
of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK?  It may not be quick enough 
to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business.

If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises 
that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think 
that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade.  If 
necessary, my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal 
sanctions issue to Mark H.  (What are the potential sanctions?)

	Jane McBride@ENRON
	10/20/2000 05:26 AM
		
Have spoken with Joe Hirl.  If there was any way we can take advantage of or 
use for the purposes of establishing Enron Japan weather exposure, all the 
exposure of other Enron companies, this should help us to establish 
legitimate weather exposure.  Enron always has weather risk and we keep a 
global weather book although of course we have open positions sometimes.

Obviously we are mostly concerned about criminal liability.

It seems to us that if we cant do the first deal, there is no position for 
market makers here, which just doesn't make sense.

Thanks.

       << File: Weather-HDD-Floor-OTC-ToaRejmb2000-10-20!.doc >> Dear
Jeremy,

      Pls see for your information my email to Alan, Mark and Alan.

      As discussed, your answers to my questions can be quite brief
and pls cross
      reference previous advice rather than repeating it.

      I think the answer to question 1 - whether we can give the
warranty - has
      got to be no.  So short and sweet on this is fine.

      Re whether we can go ahead without the same (c)(ii) from them
(but with
      (c)(iii)) is a harder question and I understand that all you can
do is
      explain our risk and exposure, in light of the current factual
situation.

      This is a risk appetite question at the end of the day.

      Jane

Weather Derivative Advice ...(Document link: Jane 
                                               McBride)

   

      Dear Alan and Mark,

      I am going to need you to help me make a risk decision.  I
welcome input
      from Mark Evans but he may be more comfortable leaving this up
to Alan and
      Mark because Alan and Mark have been involved in this gambling
issue from
      the beginning.

      Jeremy Pitts and I have had a brief conversation re my email to
him below,
      this afternoon, but he will not be able to get written comments
signed off
      by Japanese lawyers to me until Monday.

      The situation relates to the Tokyo's office's first weather
derivatives
      deal, which is with a company called Toa Reinsurance.  In a
nutshell the
      situation is that negotiations have come to a standstill because
neither
      side can move on their positions re the gambling warranties.
The deal of
      course though has already been done over the telephone several
weeks ago.

      In a nutshell then, based on discussions with Jeremy Pitts, but
to be
      clarified by Japanese lawyer on Monday, the situation is:

      1.   In terms of Enron Japan's ability to trade weather
derivatives here,
      we are operating in the grey even if we can get warranty
5(c)(ii) from
      them.

      2.   ToaRe will not give us the important warranty - 5(c)(ii)
below,
      because they say they can't.  They say they are not actually
"entering into
      the deal to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary
course of
      their business" - which is what the subject warranty says.  B&M
have
      advised that the obtaining of this warranty from a counter party
helps keep
      us in the grey and out of the red in terms of what we are doing
and also
      gives us comfort that the counter party can do the deal.

      3.   ToaRe is, in addition, separately asking us to give them
the same
      warranty.

      Jane McBride analysis

      Re 3 - Given that our legal situation is grey at best, I do not
think we
      should be giving the warranty they have requested.  They say
they will not
      give us that warranty.  The issue then is whether we can go
ahead without
      getting the warranty from them, bearing in mind that a binding
telephone
      deal has been done.

      If you agree with me that we can't give the warranty, then we
have to
      decide whether we can go ahead without getting the warranty
referred to in
      (2) above, from them.  I am not sure however that in practice we
even have
      a choice given that the trade has been done.

      If we go ahead without giving and without getting the warranty,
the risk to
      us is that we are more likely to be in breach of the prohibition
on
      gambling in the Criminal Law.  Are we willing to take this risk
and who
      needs to give me this answer?

      (See attached file:
Weather-HDD-Floor-OTC-ToaRejmb2000-10-20!.doc)

      Dear Jeremy,

      I would like to refine the following instructions.  There are
two (only)
      issues on which we need specific written advice and they both
relate to
      Warranty (c)(ii) of the draft which says "XYZ is entering into a
weather
      derivative transaction to hedge weather related risks arising in
the
      ordinary course of its business".

      1.   (a)  Can Enron Japan give the warranty at this stage in its
growth?
      Have we already had any written advice from you on whether Enron
Japan can
      warrant along these lines?  If so, when?  If not, the facts seem
to be
      that:

         Enron Japan plans to trade commodities which are energy
related but
         because we are still building up the business we are not
trading these
         products yet.
         As you know, we are getting into the power market.  If we
have done a
         weather derivative, then we can of course offer better prices
on the
         electricity deals we are negotiating.
         Other Enron companies are of course already trading many
weather
         dependant commodities and power.

      It could be argued therefore that unless we can rely on the
weather related
      risks of other Enron companies to justify our weather derivative
      transacting in these early days, that this is a speculative
transaction
      constituting gambling (depending on how the law on this works).
It is
      understandable that ToaRe would want us to warranty in effect
that we are
      not gambling because we are asking them to do so.  I know we
have had sign
      off from B&M re our weather derivative trading but I wonder if
anyone
      considered what the situation would be before we ourselves had
other
      transactions giving us weather related risks.

      (b)  If not, how could it be amended so that we can give it?

      (c)  If still relevant in the context of your answers to (a) and
(b) above,
      they did offer previously to take out all warranties so that
neither party
      gives any warranties.  The deal cannot be cancelled because it
was done on
      the telephone late Sept.  Accordingly, what is the practical
risk of us
      proceeding without the benefit of any warranties from ToaRe
(including the
      warranty that they are under the Insurance Business Law - ie an
insurance
      company.)?

      2.   They are insisting they not give (ii) and that we be
satisfied with
      (iii) only for the purposes of the Gambling Law  Pls confirm in
writing
      whether you think we can still go ahead on this basis.

      Thanks.

Brent - does this mean Tana should not allow any non-Argentine customers to 
have access to these products?  The general rule has been to allow complete 
access unless there was a legal impediment - logic regarding who will want to

Let's be sure to keep this in mind as we do future resolutions.
	Mark E Haedicke
	10/20/2000 10:56 AM
		 
I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, 
and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are 
appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:

1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully 
selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place 
and there is master agreement already signed.
3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way 
agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more 
than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.

Please give me your comments.

Mark   

Here is the confirm template (used when an ISDA Master is in place)

This is the index language for EnronOnline.  We would use something similar 
for the offline confirms.

I got your voice mail and agree with the strategy of meeting with the 
Senator's staff before sending the letter.  It would be embarrassing to 
suggest that we don't have a view on issues that should be important to us.

Re: the letter itself, if you want to make it even stronger, you could point 
out in your discussion of EnronOnline that we believe that the site could 
have been designed such that the volume of business through the site would 
have been significantly larger but for the uncertainty and restrictions in 
existing law and regulation which would be corrected by the bill.

Here are my revisions.  Let me know if you have any questions.

You can remove me from the distribution list.

Thanks for the resume - I'm looking at a number of internal candidates from 
APACHI, CALME and Southern Cone but will keep this one on file (and pass it 
along - might be good for Richard Sanders).

Hi !!

Hope you are well and that all goes well in sunny Houston .

I have a query re. JEDI II which Carol St Clair used to deal with legally , 
apparently . Mark Evans tells me she was in your group before maternity leave 
. Do you have any idea who now deals with JEDI issues ?

Many thanks and very best wishes.

I'm flying solo this weekend.  No particular plans after happy hour with the

Thanks Dale - looks good to me.

The  emergence of web trading has important implications for deal clearing.  
Meetings are scheduled for November 16-17 to discuss
these implications and to come to a consensus on a strategic solution for 
deal clearing.  

Please plan to attend or designate someone who can represent you.

Attached please find a tentative schedule for the meetings.

Additional information will follow.

Please feel free to address any questions you might have  regarding these 
meetings to  Sarita Das ( 713 345-8232 ) or Ron Nolte ( 713 853-7569 ).

My answers below in red.

	Bob Bowen
	10/19/2000 10:39 AM
		 
I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and 
QuickQuote.com in order to 
increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron 
Nolte, our IT person
for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent 
questions that may need your
legal opinion.

I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and 
set-up of EOL's discussions
with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.

Ron Nolte
10/16/2000 12:37 PM
Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey 
Moorer informed everyone about the new venture 
between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 
days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered 
on EOL.

I solicit comments from everyone.

As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto 
HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will 
magically appear. The party might think, "Hey, I can't do better than this on 
EOL, I'll take this deal".  The deal is transacted   
and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the "Do the Deal"  
button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where
it is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party 
doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.

In the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and 
TAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:

  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #
  EOL Deal #
  Sitara Deal #
  TAGG Deal #

Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in 
TAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using
HoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.

If you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using 
HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.

This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I 
assume ) will need to be changed to capture both
the HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is 
assigned by the Capture program.

This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was 
assumed that there is only one "Originating System")  program modifications 
to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( 
clears Power deals ).

Now for some issues:

1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the 
confirmation?  Whichever Enron entity  offers that product on EnronOnline 
will be the party for these trades as well.  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and
 a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  

 There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information 
is set up based on who the external party is doing business with.

 In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information 
set up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will
 have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.

2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com 
logo? No.  The confirms may reference the platform on which the trade was 
done but otherwise it should look just like a regular Enron confirmation.

3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?  
Same process as exists for EnronOnline transactions.

4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under 
EOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If
 new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, 
then contracts will have to be set up
 between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes 
through EOL, how will the appropriate
 contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, 
is  a different contract assigned 
 in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself? Seems to me it 
should be the same - we only have one agreement with Koch.

 

The confirm form is one of the many current templates used by the confirm 
desk depending on the specific transaction type and the counterparty.  For 
instance, this template is not the used for a swap (e.g. not a cap, floor, 
collar or swaption) and would not be used even for a plain vanilla swap if 
the customer had not signed an ISDA Master Agreement.  The index language can 
be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of 
trade you are doing.  But I thought you guys had decided to use the first 
price published in the following month rather than the average of the entire 
month language attached so this may not be the final version.

	Kim Stanley@ENRON
	10/25/2000 04:02 PM
		 
These are the documents to which I referred.
thanks,
kim
Here is the confirm template (used when an ISDA Master is in place)

This is the index language for EnronOnline.  We would use something similar 
for the offline confirms.

Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by 
far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being 
offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity 
derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements 
and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as 
the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.  

	Alan Aronowitz
	10/25/2000 04:16 PM
		 
Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 

Please advise. Thanks.

yep - thanks!

Please offer your apprval to the following Product Type:

US Pipeline Capacity  NNG (Firm) 

The related Products are capacity products being offered by Nothern Natural 
Gas Company. As there are regulatory issues concerning the viewing of 
proprietary information by the market affiliates of NNG, chinese walls are in 
place through the operation of policy.

You may notice that there is no Sigma Factor associated with this Product. 
The SF has purposely been set to zero, as the Credit area of NNG will be 
responsible for the daily review of exposure to their Counterparties, and 
will coordinate any Credit issues with the Credit area of ENA.

Attached please find an example of a related Product Type.

I need to ask that you expedite this approval. In order to have the Product 
Type available for this coming Monday I must have the full approval by no 
later than this Wednesday (tomorrow) at Noon.

If you have any question, please feel free to call.

I'm not sure if you guys are on this mail list but here is the most recent 
message from Stacey at ISDA.
	Stacy Carey <SCAREY@ISDA.ORG>
	10/25/2000 08:38 PM
		 
Senate Agriculture and Banking staff, Treasury, the CFTC and the SEC met
this afternoon to discuss Senator Gramm's proposed changes.  Preliminary
reports indicate that agreement on 7 of the 34 issues was made earlier in
the afternoon.  It is unclear what the 7 items were, however, the meeting
broke in order for Gramm's staff to brief the Senator on developments.  When
the meeting resumed Gramm's staff reportedly backed off the prior
agreements.  In sum, no progress was made at the end of the day.  The staffs
agreed to meet again tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. (On an side note Senator
Gramm's staff indicated that only a handful of banks supported the bill)

We also participated on a conference call with the AdHoc Coalition and the
Chicago Futures Exchanges held by Tom Ewing this afternoon.  Ewing advised
that he had a discussion with Speaker Hastert who is well aware of the
importance of this issue. He encouraged all of us to make renewed appeals to
the House and Senate leadership and as many Senate contacts as possible.

In my estimation, tomorrow will likely be our last opportunity to have any
sort of impact on Senate activity.  At the end of the day we will either
have a deal or negotiations will have failed.  I would suggest making the
following contacts tomorrow morning with a simple message:  1) We are aware
that the staffs are continuing to work on resolution of outstanding issues.
2) It is vitally important that these issues be resolved and that passage of
the legislation occur this year.

My recommendation would be to deliver this message to the following
entities:

1.  Senator Gramm -- since his staff is under the impression that only a
handful of banks support the bill.
2.  Senator Leadership -- Lott and Nickels
3.  Senate Agriculture Committee Members - Republican and Democrats
4.  Senate Banking Committee Members - Republican and Democrats
5.  House Leadership - Hastert, Delay and Armey

* Calls to Lugar are not necessary

Finally, I am of the firm belief that this legislation stands a worse if any
chance of enactment next year.
We need to give this our best shot tomorrow!

Many thanks!

Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but 
probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based 
EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, 
but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you

Further to our telephone call of last week with Ed Feo and Steve Kramer,

relating to multilateral online trading systems for pipeline capacity.? Also 
attached are three CFTC no-action letters, the first of which (Channel 4)

The other two letters (Altra and QuickTrade) relate primarily to natural gas, 
although the relevant CFTC regulatory issues appear to be similar.? Please 
feel free to call me at 212-530-5414 with any questions you may have about 
the attached documents.? I look forward to working with you and EnronOnline 
to address these issues.

FYI - I'll talk to her about their model and plans in a little more detail.  
In the meanwhile, given that they create a link to us either way, we might as 
well allow them the use of our logo.  In case they become a big eye-ball 
aggregator, we want the traffic to flow our way as well.

Will check with Mark for his opinion.

Thoughts?

Rahil,

Thanks for visiting Energy News Live.  We are working to correct the
spelling of EnronOnline in the Exchange menu and you should see the change
by the end of the week.  The reason EnronOnline is not represented as a
logo, like Houston Street and TradeSpark, is due to legal constraints.
Williams does not have legal permission to display Enron's logo, only the
link.  As future phases roll out, we would like to work with your legal
department to obtain these rights.

Thanks for the feedback and please let me know if you have any further
questions or suggestions.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Daly

Your review and approval of the following product type in the EOL Datamanager 
is needed (for directions on approval , please see steps for approval at the 
bottom of this e-mail).  

Trader : Fletcher Sturm

Example:

US Pwr Phy Index MWD Ent Peak            Oct00      USD/MWh

A US Power Transaction with Enron Power Marketing, Inc., under which the 
Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity for firm energy 
equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price.  The Contract Price shall 
be the Floating Price, as adjusted by the price submitted by the Counterparty 
via the website.  The period of time during which the Floating Price is 
derived (a "Determination Period") shall be a calendar month during the term 
of the Transaction; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one month, such Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction.

The transaction is for the applicable hours as set forth herein on each 
Delivery Day for the Effective Date 01 Oct 2000 to the Termination Date 31 
Oct 2000.

The transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any available point 
Into Entergy System Border at Seller's daily election.

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the 
daily prices listed in the Index for power delivered during Peak hours on 
each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period.  The Floating 
Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the daily 
prices published in Megawatt Daily's Market Report under the headings "Ranges 
and Indexes of Trades for Standard 16-Hour Daily Products;Wtd. Av. Index; 
Peak Hours, 0600 to 2200; Entergy, into"  (the "Index").

The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.

Alan,

Further to the last e-mail, I attach for your information a copy of trhe 
Questionnaires which have been sent to our German and Spanish counsel.

Obviously, I did not want to send a copy of this to Jeff Kinneman as I am 
sure that he would not be interested in the Questionnaires - just the results 
of them!!  Hence, this second e-mail.

Kind regards

Mark,

Many thanks for your message.  Re your reference to UK laws on Equity 
Trading, I assume that you are referring to the proposed Equity Trading 
facility in London;  I trust that  you also received my detailed e-mail on 
that topic of yesterday evening.  Please note that I have now received a fax 
from Alan Aronowitz with the Houston trading policy (containing Chinese Wall 
information), to which I refer in that e-mail - I shall be considering the 
sufficiency of that policy for UK purposes later today. 

Re your request for advice on the extraterritorial effect of the U.S 
securities' laws, this is a new question which we have been asked to look 
at.  In my view, there will be some extraterritorial effect of such laws on 
the activities.  I have also discussed this issue with Scott Sefton who has 
provided me with a general overview on this, noting particularly the U.S. 
Insider Dealing laws and potential U.S. reporting and disclosure of 
interests' requirements; however, Scott has suggested that we retain external 
U.S. counsel for in-depth advice on this, with which I agree.

If you agree that we should instruct external counsel on this issue, I would 
be more than happy to deal with this from London;  please let me now which 
external counsel you would wish to use.  In my and Scott's views, we should 
use expert  "SEC"-knowledgeable counsel in New York, such as either Cravath, 
Cadwallader, Davis Polk, Cleary's, etc.

Please just let me know - I would be able to instruct external counsel today, 
get an estimate of their time for dealing with the US aspect and report back 
immediately.        

Kind regards

Mark

   

Mark:  We also need to look at the UK laws regarding equity trading and what 
the extraterritiorial reach is of the US sec;urities laws.  Please  copy Mark 
Taylor on this matter as well.  Please give me a time frame on when we will 
have answers to these questions.  Thanks.  Mark Haedicke

I won't be able to be on the 11:30 call this morning.  I have given Elizabeth 
a copy of the 'omnibus' document we probably used if the put options sold to 
Puget Sound were derivatives and described the arguments we could make that 
the imposition of the proposed price cap would be a Market Disruption Event.  
If it is a Market Disruption Event the most likely outcome under the contract 
(since it will last more than 3 days and we presumably will not be able to 
negotiate an agreed price) is that "the Floating Price shall be determined in 
good faith by ENA, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes."  I'm 
not sure what dealer quotes would get us under these circumstances.  Can 
dealers quote prices in excess of the price cap?

I have set up a conference call at 11:30 on Monday to discuss.

	Christian Yoder
	10/27/2000 12:15 PM
		 
In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to 
us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised 
by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put 
option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would 
never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this 
filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the 
fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the 
options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our 
ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of 
thing,ie. is this some kind of "illegality" issue?  I am working on the 
second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, 
I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy

Puget Sound has filed a complaint against all jurisdictional sellers of 
wholesale energy and/or capacity in the Pacific Northwest, including parties 
to WSPP agreement.  Puget Sound requests FERC to impose price cap on 
wholesale sales of energy and capacity in the Pacific Northwest equal to the 
lowest price cap "established, ordered, or permitted by the Commission for 
wholesale purchases by the Cal ISO or Cal PX . . . ."  Puget requests an 
effective date of December 25,2000.

Mark,

Further to the requirement to send an email to the desk heads informing them 
of the policy not to access NNG Capacity trade information, do you think the 
following will suffice?

Body:

Please note that as of Monday, October 30, Northern Natural Gas will commence 
transacting for capacity on EnronOnline. In accordance with FERC 
For at least the next several months, NNG will be using EnronOnline and 
sharing the same database. We have agreed a policy with NNG legal that ENA 
employees will not use  obtain commercial information with regard to NNG 
activities which is not in the public domain. Accordingly, you are not 
permitted to access such information.  Attempts to access such information 
may be monitored and will be considered a violation of the policy.if you 
become aware of the existence of any such information, please adhere to the 
policy.

Janette:

This may be more than you were looking for - let me know if you want me to 
pare it down a bit.  I assume we will have the opportunity to revise these as 
time goes on......

The Technology Plan Committee is meeting again this Wednesday, and I need to 
give the committee an update on the progress of my work.  I would appreciate 
your response to the following.  Many thanks.

The committee has started working on the first phase of the Technology Plan 
which is to develop an intranet web page for ENA Legal.  Our department's 
organizational chart will be provided as well as a description of the area(s) 
of responsibilities for each group.  Would you be so kind as to provide me 
with a short paragraph describing your group's responsibilities?  The group 
is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday, October 25, so if I could have the 
description of your group's responsibilities as soon as possible it would be 
greatly appreciated.  

Mark Haedicke is eager to have our intranet web page designed as soon as 
possible.  Many thanks for your time and attention to this matter.

could you add a legal disclaimer to this draft term sheet that reflects the

I know that you will be at a management meeting the exact same time that this 
conference is scheduled
to take place, but I was hoping you could assign this task to someone else in 
ENA Legal.  As you will note
on the agenda attached below, we have placed the Legal Department at the top 
of the agenda after the 
introduction to discuss "Legal Implications of the Electronic Marketplace".

This discussion should conceivably include discussions of the following 
topics:  

Electronic signatures (in particular EnronOnline)
Websites for delivery and executing confirmations (Commodity Logic)
See "XIII Future Trends" on Page 4 of the agenda

Please let me know as soon as possible if this will be possible.  As you can 
see, this is a very important
topic for us.  Call me if I can help clarify any points.  

One other point - I am assuming that you guys are the head guys for financial 
and physical legal decision 
making for Houston, Calgary and London.   For your information, there may be 
some lawyer types coming from the London
Global Markets group.

Also, JAD means Joint Accelerated Development.

Please be sure to access the performance review system as soon as possible to 
select persons to contribute to your review.  While commercial people are 
particularly helpful, you may select reviewers at any level.

Thought you might like this.

I will be happy to attend but do have a regular 9:00 meeting on Fridays.

In Net Works we receive a lot of new ideas from around the organisation which 
need consideration (and some need actioning).  I though it might be a good 
idea if the above group could get together every two weeks and go through the 
ideas.  I currently have quite a few in my inbox.

Would everyone be able to make a meeting on Friday mornings?  Say 8:30 for 30 
minutes max.

Anyone else who should attend?

I want to underscore that moving just the banking stuff to a bill to pass 
this year is VERY bad and something we should vehemently oppose.

	Chris Long@ENRON
	10/31/2000 08:05 AM
		
Jim - The CEA legislation has died and risen again so many times over the 
last two weeks.  As of yesterday, Senator Gramm (the one obstacle to final 
passage) told a group of banking lobbyist that he opposes the legislation in 
full, but would consider moving the legal certainty provisions for banking 
swaps.  This is not good for us and it is not good for the entire 
legislation.  We are still trying to discern what exactly Gramm wants and 
what he is up to.  We should know by later today the ultimate fate of the 
bill.

I'll keep you in the loop.

Justin on which Enron entity we will use for trading in the U.S.?

Mark,

Further to Mark Haedicke's e-mails, for your information please see below my 
e-mail of yesterday evening to Mark Haedicke and Scott Sefton re the impact 
of English law on a potential Equity trading desk based in London.

Kind regards

Mark  
Mark Elliott
02/02/99 06:33 PM
I have reviewed the above proposal (which includes having had some in-depth 
conference calls with Slaughter & May, London) and conclude that the project 
is technically and legally viable provided that the points listed below are 
dealt with.  Mark, once you have read this note, if you would like to discuss 
the contents with Scott and me, please do not hesitate to give us a call.

SFA Authorisation and Structure

On account of the potential frequency and size of trading (even on an 
execution-only basis for ECT Investments Inc), the London Desk should be 
authorised by the SFA.  The personnel involved in the activity should be 
registered with the SFA as, at least, Securities Representatives, and 
preferably as General Representatives.   

Accordingly, subject to Tax Department's input, the London traders should be 
located in EEFT (already SFA-regulated) which would act as arranger or agent 
for the existing Houston-based equity trading corporation, ECT Investments, 
Inc (the latter as principal).

Subject to Tax and other internal considerations, it would also be possible 
for EEFT to act as agent to do this business for, as principal, either 
ECTRIC, the proposed replacement vehicle for ECTRIC,  or a new UK unregulated 
entity (the latter would apply if a UK book was required).  A UK entity, as 
principal, would be "unregulated" if it was a purely passive booking company.

Provided that the ultimate principal is either ECT Investments, Inc., ECTRIC 
or an unregulated UK principal, there should not be any UK regulatory capital 
requirements.

The SFA would need to be informed in advance of our intention to have an 
equity trading capability in London and EEFT's SFA business profile would 
need to be extended to cover both arranging and dealing as agent in respect 
of equities.

Transaction Reporting        

As the business would be SFA regulated per the above, SFA Rule 5-49 would 
require all transactions to be "Transaction Reported" - for pure cash equity 
business (wherever the equities are listed) this would be accomplished by 
computer-entry of trade details which would then download to one of the 
London Stock Exchange's ("LSE's") systems known as either "SEQUAL" or 
"CHECKING".

The purpose of such reporting  is not only to enable the LSE and SFA to 
establish daily market volumes, etc.,  but also, for example, to provide the 
relevant information to the LSE's surveillance unit which actively monitors 
all trades for signs of Insider Dealing.

Systems' impact 

On the above structure, there should be no extra systems' requirements, 
except:-

 PC screens for the traders having feeds of market quotes / market 
information (e.g., Reuters, Telerate, etc):

potentially a computer-link for settlement purposes

a computer-link for the Transaction Reporting of executed deals to the LSE 
(see above)

a computer-link to produce exception reports of executed deals to enable a 
Compliance Department to monitor for Disclosable Interests in Shares (see 
below) 

a computer-link to produce reports of executed deals for monitoring against 
the Watch and Restricted Lists (see Insider Dealing below)

Accountants, e.g., Arthur Andersen, would be the best placed to advise on the 
correct form of computer-links, especially those for Transaction Reporting 
purposes.

Disclosure of Interests in shares          

Re UK listed companies there are the following disclosures to be made of 
equity interests:-

S. 198 Companies Act '85 - acquisition of 3 % interest or more, or disposal 
to below a 3% interest, or acquisition of each whole % above a 3% interest of 
a UK Public Co's voting capital requires to be disclosed to the company.  
Group interests / concert party interests are aggregated to arrive at the 
thresholds and "interest" includes a right or option to acquire shares.

Substantial Acquisition Rules - acquisition of over 15% interest in a UK 
public company requires separate disclosure to the Company and, if listed, to 
the LSE.

Rule 9 Takeover Code - acquisition of 30 % or more of UK public company's 
voting shares leads to a requirement to make a cash offer for the remainder.

S. 212 Companies Act '85 - UK public companies can request at any time an 
entity to disclose to the company particulars of their, and other persons', 
interests in the company's share capital, including such details for the last 
three years.

Rule 8.3 Takeover Code - during an "offer period" relating to a UK public 
company (and the offer is a "securities exchange offer"), persons owning or 
controlling directly or indirectly 1% or more of relevant securities of that 
company (including cash-settled derivatives) must disclose such interests to 
the Take-Over Panel.

Please note that there may be similar rules in other jurisdictions, depending 
on where the relevant equities are listed - indeed in some jurisdictions 
there may be  prohibitions on foreign ownership of equities. 

Insider Dealing   

Looking just to the UK legislation (The Criminal Justice Act 1993), the 
various criminal offences of Insider Dealing are committed, basically, when 
an individual has Inside Information (meaning unpublished price-sensitive 
information) concerning the securities of an entity or entities (whether UK 
or non-UK) which are officially listed in any State within the European 
Economic Area or admitted to dealing, or quoted, on a "Regulated Market" 
(e.g., including the major European markets, NASDAQ, etc).  Please note that 
"price-sensitive"  means likely to have a significant effect on the price of 
any securities - not just those of the entity or entities in respect of which 
one has the knowledge; and "securities" includes shares, debentures, options 
to subscribe for shares / debentures, depository receipts, futures and CFDs.  
Once in knowledgeable possession of insider information, the offences are 
commited if one deals in price-affected securities in relation to  that 
information, or encourages another to so deal or discloses the information.  
The offence is punishable by imprisonment and / or fines.

        The offences are highly technical and there are certain defences 
available.  

The manner in which to try to prevent the internal commission of the offences 
is to put in place, simply, "established and effective" Chinese Walls between 
those individuals who would be involved in the Equity Trading facility and 
others in within the Enron Group who may have such inside information, to 
prevent the potential flows of Inside Information between those with such 
information and the Equity Traders in London.  Both I and Slaughter & May 
feel that potentially replicating in London the Enron Chinese Wall  policy 
actively followed in Houston could suffice in this respect as it is generally 
felt that the US requirements should be at least as stringent as those 
required in the UK.  Alan Aronowitz is in the process of  sending me 
Houston's policy in this regard for review and upon receipt that policy will 
be reviewed accordingly.

However, the relevant Chinese Walls would need to be put in place for Insider 
Dealing purposes between, in my and Slaughters' views, (a) on the one side, 
the Equity Traders and (b) on the other side, originators and traders, and 
persons involved in any corporate finance, M&A, Joint Venture, and financing  
activity.         

Not only would the Chinese Walls need to be implemented, but also they would 
need to be actively monitored by a Compliance Department in London to ensure 
that they were being observed and effective.

In addition to the Houston Chinese Wall policy, there should be implemented 
both a "Watch List" and a "Restricted List" procedure (I understand the 
latter already exists and would need to be combined with additions to such 
list in London ) - the Watch List does not actively prevent trading in 
relevant securities, but is an intermediate step before a stock is placed on 
the Restricted List: i.e., companies in which Enron is involved in sensitive 
transactions would be placed on such a list and an internal Compliance 
Department should then actively monitor for any unusual deals by the Equity 
Traders (e.g., by volume etc) in stocks of the Companies on  such list.  If 
any irregular trading activity is then spotted - it could be internally 
investigated.  Obviously, an internal procedure would need to be established 
to gather information on sensitive transactions so that they could be placed 
on the Watch / Restricted Lists as appropriate.

Other Confidential Information

In addition to any specific Insider Information, various Enron Group entities 
will be party to specific Confidentiality Agreements (or other forms of 
Agreement, e.g., Master Agreements, containing confidentiality clauses) with 
third parties, pursuant to which the Enron entities may have confidentiality 
obligations to those third parties and which may prevent the contracting 
Enron entities from disclosing certain information to affiliated Enron 
entities.

Obviously, in order to comply with our various obligations in this regard we 
would need either to check each contract or ensure that Enron personnel were 
aware of their obligations in this regard and never disclosed to the London 
Equity traders any information covered by the confidentiality obligations.  
The Watch List could be used to log, for monitoring purposes, companies to 
whom Enron owes confidentiality obligations.  

Both with regard to Insider Information and this form of confidential 
information, employees would need to be actively trained to ensure that only 
generally available market sentiment on a third party could be passed on to 
the London Equity traders and not more specific information.    

Compliance Department 

If this proposal moves ahead, my suggestion is that Enron in London would 
need to hire an experienced  Compliance professional for the following 
purposes:-

active implementation of, review of, and consistent monitoring of, the 
Chinese Wall policy;

active monitoring of executed deals against Watch and Restricted Lists;

active monitoring of executed deals for Disclosable Interests in Shares in 
the UK and similar rules and prohibitions in other jurisdictions;

handling SFA and  LSE queries on Transaction Reporting; 

handling potential LSE and Takeover Panel queries on executed Transactions; 
and

running continuous training courses for Enron personnel on Insider Dealing, 
confidentiality obligations, etc.  

In addition, such person could have responsibility for the implementation of, 
monitoring of, and ensuring compliance with, SFA Conduct of Business Rules 
and Moneylaundering compliance, and any relevant exchange rules, firm-wide in 
London across all of Enron's business - e.g., its OTC Derivatives' 
business.    
Kind regards

Further to my Questionnaire to Maureen Bartlett at Cadwalader on the 
applicability of U.S. securities' laws in the context of a London Equities' 
Desk, I received Maureen's responses in a lengthy telephone call yesterday 
afternoon.  I shall only comment where according to Maureen we shall have to 
be mindful of an issue - where I do not comment, Maureen said the answer to 
the Question was "no" (i.e., good news for us).  Hence, Maureen's advice:-

Q 6 - Generally, ECTII would only bear responsibility to US regulatory 
authorities for EEFT's acts and omissions if ECTII was a "knowing 
co-conspirator" in an EEFT act or omission which violated US securities' 
laws.  EEFT would not have any responsibility for its acts and omissions to 
any US regulatory authority.  EEFT would not have any responsibility to US 
regulatory authorities for any acts or omissions of ECTII except again only 
to the extent that it may have colluded with ECTII.  The only exceptions to 
these positions are set out below.  

Q 7 - U.S. disclosure requirements re interests in equities - where initially 
EEFT acts as pure arranger without any discretion for ECTII (i.e., pure 
execution-only facility in London), the U.S. disclosure requirements will be 
down to ECTII to comply with (as the principal).  This will still be the case 
if EEFT moves to having agency authority (i.e., having discretion) to book 
trades to ECTII - the only difference here is that there will need to be 
extra careful monitoring to ensure that EEFT does not do a deal in a stock 
out of London which, when aggregated with other Enron Group interests in that 
stock, take us over a disclosable amount (e.g., under s 13d SEA '34, a 5 % 
holding of a stock registered under s 12 SEA '34; and 10 % under s 16a SEA 
'34).  This will mean that we shall need extra careful use and monitoring of 
Watch and Restricted Lists between London and Houston and may be London 
having a policy preventing acquisition by the London desk of a large block of 
stock (to be defined) in any U.S. entity without Houston's consent.

Q 8 + Q 9 - U.S. Insider Dealing laws apply to (a) stock of U.S. issuers and 
(b) stock of non-U.S. issuers listed in the U.S..  EEFT would not be liable 
under U.S. Insider Dealing laws unless it knew that it had price-sensitive 
information (as defined under U.S. laws) and dealt in either (a) or (b) or 
encouraged another to deal, etc.  ECTII  would not be liable vicariously to 
the US authorities for EEFT in this respect - ECTII would have to have 
committed the offence itself, e.g. by having the knowledge then dealing etc 
or colluding with EEFT.  Vice versa applies re ECTII - EEFT.  Basically this 
comes down, once again, to having adequate. and well monitored Chinese Walls, 
procedures, education of staff re what they can and cannot do etc.  As well 
as other Chinese Walls, obviously ECTII staff would not be able to pass 
price-sensitive information which is not publicly known to EEFT staff and 
vice versa.

Q 10 + 11 - Re Reg S new issues.  As ECTII would be the principal and is in 
the US, not only is ECTII directly prevented from buying a Reg S offering 
within the lock-out period but so would EEFT as ECTII's arranger / agent.  If 
EEFT purchased a Reg S offering within the lock-out period, ECTII would have 
broken the rules.  Obviously this would have to go into the compliance manual 
governing EEFT's conduct and again London trading would need to be actively 
monitored for compliance.

I still firmly believe that there is nothing in the above advice which makes 
a London equities' facility for Houston legally and technically difficult - 
it comes down to Chinese Walls, policies and procedures and active daily 
monitoring by a compliance department of the activities of the London desk.

Maureen will shortly be sending me her written confirmation of the advice 
which she gave me over the telephone.

Kind regards

Mark

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project 
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. 
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further 
assistance.

I have met with Gustavo Mengui, one of the most active representatives of ADA 
today.

My findings are the following:

ADA is very active and taking a leading role on the NETTING ISSUE. Good news 
is that they consider that they will be able to pass a law that redifines 
netting on the bankrupcy law by year end. They assume that they will have 
"media sanci?n" before mid December. Media sanci?n is basically having 
approval by one of the chambers (Diputados) and a strong support to going to 
the Senators Chamber shortly after. We will receive the law project today. 
The law project was designed by Hector Alegria. Gustavo assumes that they 
will be available to talking with our legal team upon request.
They have received from the Central Bank a request to propose all necessary 
changes in the regulations so as to have the (interest rate mainly) 
derivatives market going asap. This shows a fertile ground on this 
institution for our future conversations. 
On the CNV's side, he stated that the porject of law (on netting) was 
actively supported by this body. ACtually, he commented that CNV officials 
were active speakers when this matter was treated in the commission session 
at Congress.
ADA is working with PWC on the tax issues. ADA and PWC are preparing to 
present the government officials their proposal for the Ingresos Brutos 
treatment of derivatives in the City of Buenos Aires (makes me think that we 
have been talking to the right guys these last days).
Gustavo was crystal clear that, although they have been supported and funded 
by banks, they are a Foundation and they are open to working with Enron. He 
insisted that he does not expect conflict of interest to arise and that the 
energy sector is strategical for them, specially considering the recent 
evolution in financial energy trading.
There will be some issues regarding the support ADA will give to the Rofex 
effort of creating an energy market. The OTC versus the formal exchange issue 
is to be addressed.

ADA is willing to work with us on the future and we might have to do some 
follow up meetings to get this type of news earlier.
My personal opinion is that we might like to go ahead with our conversations 
with regulators and officials but I doubt whether we should go with ADA or 
not. There are various pros and cons.

Lets talk for 5 minutes,

Bernardo

I am aware there is information that EnronCredit is not allowed to see. 
However as far as I can tell, the RAC website contains other counterparty 
information like E-ratings that we are allowed to see, and it is that 
information that I would like to get access to.

Tomas,

EnronCredit.com is prohibited from access to counterparty trade positions per 
instructions from legal. That, in short, means you can't see counterparty 
exposures, or CAS. Bryan asked earlier this year for him and Markus and we 
had to give them the same response.

As to access to the RAC site, you should have general access to public data. 
I'll have to check with Mark Taylor about your access to other info.

Thanks for your note and glad to hear you are all doing well.  I'd love to 
have lunch - let's do it on the 21st (I'm out of town the earlier dates and 
the 22nd is the day before Thanksgiving).  We do have a lot to catch up on 
(EGFinance changes, new hires for the group, new internal lawyers for the 
group, office space issues) - I haven't wanted to bother you at home but 
things are definitely moving around here - as usual I guess.

Mark

I enjoyed it too - actually it's just as well that I was carted off when I 
was - I was sound asleep by 8:30 and still feel the affects.

It looks to me like another case of an obvious error (i.e. the counterparty 
should have known it was a mistake).  I'm afraid we've just been lucky that 
the numbers have been so far off - some day we're going to have one that is 
too close to call obvious.

I've reviewed the PG&E trade in question again and the spread value is 
actually $4.62, rather than $9. Given the fact that a typical spread trade 
for Nat Gas is aroung 5 or 6 cents, I know that this correction is not much 
of a consolation, but I wanted to clarify the pricing nonetheless.

Deal Number Q75763.1, .2
Leg 1 = 9.38
Leg 2 = 4.76

Spread valueon trade = 4.62

I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, 
and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are 
appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:

1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully 
selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place 
and there is master agreement already signed.
3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way 
agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more 
than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.

Please give me your comments.

Mark   

My comments are marked on the attached.

approval, please forward them back to me. Thanks.

Bob didn't make it to the meeting but did leave a voice mail suggesting that 
rather than creating a separate GTC for the brokers we refer to the GTCs 
already online for regular customers and have them agree to be responsible 
for the liquidated damages that would be calculated under those terms if the 
deal falls through.

But hopefully we are beyond the question phase.

Legal Mark following on from Paul Smith's email attached  are the revised 
GTCs.  I am advised your signoff is required prior to them being loaded into 
EOL . Essentially they are the previous HDD and CDD "Australian weather swaps 
GTCs. Each GTC has been amended slightly so it may be used for a product  
where the weather observations are derived from a source other than the 
Australian Bureau of Meteorology. I have reviewed the GTCs and confirm they 
are acceptable.

Would you please signify your concurrence by email.     

Tax I have seen a response from PWC yesterday that appeared satisfactory. 
Perhaps Susan or Heidi can confirm this  to Jeff who I understand also needs 
to give his signoff.

Dale attached are the final product descriptions.  Please call me if you have 
any questions.

     

All,

Hong Kong Weather products will be launched on EOL Tuesday 14th November in 
Hong Kong.

Current status is:
Legal:  GTC's are final and with David Minns / Mark Taylor for sign-off. This 
sign-off should be completed by 10am Thursday (Houston time)   in order for 
the GTC's to be loaded by Tuesday (Sydney time);
  Long Form descriptions are undergoing last adjustments today (DM), and will 
be forwarded tonight for signoff;
Tax:  PWC has been asked for more specific advise on some issues. DM / HM 
following up. These issues will not stop the launch;
Risk:  HK weather data is with RAC now for calculating sigma's. AF has USD 
MTM weather book running;
Marketing: No marketing has been undertaken yet, and will not be prior to the 
launch - partially pending PWC advice;
Technical: DN has set the products up in test environment. I will go through 
these tomorrow with Dale;
Credit:  We are not soliciting any new counterparties for the launch;
Data:  CW and JZ have completed data cleaning and analysis. RY is pricing;

We will require signoff from Rudi, Tom, Mark & Jeff to transfer the products 
to production, and we would like to do this before this weeks out. We want to 
have products loaded and priced in production Monday afternoon (Sydney time). 
If there are any other issues that I have missed, or incorrectly stated, 
please reply by Friday morning (Sydney time) to allow time to address them.

Regards,
Paul

I want to apologize once again for having you come out on Saturday morning to 
help with interviews and find out that you were not needed.  I appreciate 
your support and cooperation and on behalf of the Associate and Analyst 
Programs would like to give you a shirt  to demonstrate such.  Please let me 
know what size you wear.  You will have to guard this shirt with your life 
because many interviewers have been asking for them and we have not been 
giving them out :).

Again, I am sorry for any inconvenience we caused you and promise not to let 
it happen again.

Thanks for your continued support.

Greg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.  My only comments would be 
(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the 
commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual 
matter.  I agree about Tana.

then send it out to everyone.  I really think that having Tana come up for a 
few days as soon as she can would be very helpful for Linda and Sharon.

Thanks

Greg Johnston
11/06/2000 11:53 AM
Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

Greg

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction project is almost finished (we have been given a 
completion date of Monday, November 20).  There is good news and bad news.  
First the bad: the office which you currently occupy will be in the next 
construction phase which will begin as soon as possible after the current 
phase is finished.    Now the good:  we have an office for you to sit in 
until your new office is ready.  Joya Davis has submitted the move request 
and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and 
arrange your move.

I think your "final" office changed when your group changed - the East 
Origination/Gas Trading Group is in the southeast quadrant of the floor and 
they have given you 3882, just  four doors down the hall from where I am 
now.  The construction workers are gone for the day if you want to stop by 
and see it.

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.

The first market disruption fallback (after a 3 day waiting period) is an 
"Alternative Price Source" which would need to be spelled out in the long 
description - but that only works if we have an alternative price source to 
specify.  It's also important to make sure that the feared event is included 
in the Market Disruption Event definition.  I think this is the relevant 
language from the GTC:

7.  Market Disruption.  If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is 
continuing on any Trading Day, the Floating Price for such Trading Day shall 
be determined pursuant to the Floating Price Source specified in this 
Transaction for the first Trading Day thereafter on which no Market 
Disruption Event exists; provided, however, if the Floating Price is not so 
determined within three Business Days after the first Trading Day on which 
the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price 
shall be determined by reference to the Alternative Floating Price Source 
specified in this Transaction, if any, which is not subject to a Market 
Disruption Event.  If no Alternative Floating Price Source is available or 
has been specified, and the Market Disruption Event continues for more than 
three Business Days, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree 
on a Floating Price (or a method for determining a Floating Price), and if 
the parties have not so agreed on or before the twelfth Business Day 
following the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred 
or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by 
Enron, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes. 

"Market Disruption Event" means, with respect to a Floating Price Source, any 
of the following events (the existence of which shall be determined in good 
faith by Enron):  (a) the failure of the Floating Price Source to announce or 
publish information necessary for determining the Floating Price; (b) the 
failure of trading to commence or the permanent discontinuation or material 
suspension of trading in the relevant futures contract, options contract or 
commodity on the exchange or market (e.g., NYMEX) acting as the Floating 
Price Source (the "Exchange"); (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance 
or unavailability of any relevant Floating Price Source; (d) the temporary or 
permanent closing of any Exchange acting as the Floating Price Source; (e) 
the imposition of trading limits by the Exchange such that there are limits 
on the range within which the price of the relevant commodity may fluctuate 
in the prompt month and the closing or settlement price of such commodity on 
such day is at the upper or lower limit of that range; (f) a material change 
in the formula for or the method of determining the Floating Price; or (g) a 
material change in the content, composition or constitution of the relevant 
commodity.

Further to John's e-mail below, I do not believe that we need to build this 
type of language for alternative settlement into the long descriptions for 
financial power products, as both the form of ISDA and the GTC that we use 
for confirming financial transactions (which contain the legal terms and 
conditions that will govern Canadian EOL financial power transactions) 
contain market disruption provisions.  These market disruption provisions 
provide the mechanism for determining the index price if the referenced price 
is unavailable or there is a material change in the formula or calculation of 
the referenced price, etc.  I am just waiting to confirm with Mark Taylor 
that the on-line form of GTC applicable to financial transactions is the same 
as for the form used for transactions not entered into through EOL.

Thanks

Greg

We should add some language to the EOL power descriptions to include a 
mechanism for alternative settlement in the event that the power pool price 
of Alberta becomes defunct.  I won't put any language in regarding market 
delay though.  My intention is to trade this product whether I have a PPA or 
not.

I'm going to be hard to get next week - Monday & Tuesday I'll be in NYC 
(speaking at a conference), Wed. a.m. in the office and the rest of the week 
at the management conference.  If it works for you, any time the following 
week (20, 21 or 22) would be better for me.  If it is urgent, let me know and 
I will try to break from my meetings during the day on Mon., Tues. afternoon 
or maybe Wed. (but since that's the only time I'll be in the office all week 
it's already pretty full).  Just let me know - my assistant (Taffy x57373) 
can set something up on my calendar if you have a time you want to reserve.

Lunch on Monday would be great - anything in particular in mind?

I'm speaking at a conference in ny again but never got around to making any 
plans - any chance you're free?

Hello from Texas.  It's probably been about six years since we last spoke but 
I thought I'd drop you a line to see how you were doing.  I saw Pete Datos 
for brunch when I was in town a couple of years ago and he seemed to be fine 
but I have been very bad about staying in touch with people.  Ted Bockius & I 
are still together - he works at an internet start-up company doing their 
public relations work.  I'm still a corporate lawyer at Enron working on 
financial contracts and e-commerce stuff.  I get to nyc 3 or 4 times a year 
so we should get together for a drink or a meal some time and catch up.

Hope you are well.

Mark

 

I'll be at the Peninsula (55th & 5th) (212)956-2888.  I will have my cell 
phone but no guarantees that the battery will last (713)206-8080.  Either of 
the places you mentioned would be fine with me - my conference is at the PLI 
Center (on 7th around 51st or 52nd).  Just tell me when & where!

I concur in David's analysis.  Any idea who the target market is in HK?  If 
we have specific customers in mind, would it be possible to approach them 
directly rather than making the password application generally available?  
It's not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would 
still be some targeted HK residents, just not the public.

	David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	11/12/2000 08:14 PM
		
There is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for Hong Kong. It 
does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we 
should revisit  the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password 
Application on the EOL registration screen. As I raised in my email last week 
the Hong Kong regulator (SFC) has issued internet trading guidelines that 
state that internet sites that "target" Hong Kong residents will be expected 
to comply with HK securities legislation. 

Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on 
making public offers regarding (i) securities; and (ii) "investment 
arrangements relating to property other than securities".  Whilst it is 
difficult to see how a HK weather swap (or any other product listed on EOL ) 
would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may 
want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong 
residents. My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the 
publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password 
application for Hong Kong residents. The SFC could well take the view that a 
HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong. Again it 
is the act of making the offer, not entering into the transaction that is the 
subject of the Ordinance. Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we 
ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades  may not be 
viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made.     

l  have had an opportunity to review a 27 September 2000 advice that Jonathan 
Marsh obtained from Allen Overy (HK). In Section 2 they raise similar 
concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance. 

Way Forward

I would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be 
removed from the list on the EOL registration screen, at least for the 
present. The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC 
needs to be recognised. (This possibility exists irrespective  of the 
decision to list HK weather products. Clearly on a practical level a greater 
awareness in HK of EOL  generated by the launch of HK weather may be the 
catalyst that attracts  SFC interest.)  Whilst our legal analysis has not 
identified any  breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we 
mitigated the risk of an  SFC instigated dialogue on this point.  

This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password 
application.

If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the 
public (ie where no password is needed) provisions that are unambiguously 
directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC 
first. I note Allen & Overy also raised this as a possibility.

I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas. But 
the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in 
concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present.

Hi Guys

Have checked the outstanding item with Jonathan Marsh.  Jonathan's view was 
that the legal due diligence conducted by Mallesons provided the relevant 
information.  Media coverage of launch of weather products based in HK may 
lead to review by the HK regulator.  

OK to proceed.

Regards
Amita

Dale,

What is the legality issue that needs to be addressed by Amita regarding 
offerring HK Weather products. David Minns and Mark Taylor have completed all 
the legal checking and sign-off required for this product launch.

I have created some Hong Kong weather Products in Production for your review. 
You will find them in the Product Manager; 34991 and 34992.

Since we are still waiting on a response from Amita regarding the 'legality' 
issue of offering Hong Kong Products, I have not made the necessary changes 
to the Australia static data components nor have I 'squirrelled' the AUS 
products. Once the go ahead has been given, we will release the ticker item, 
update the AUS Static Data components, secret squirrel the AUD Products, and 
move the Hong Kong Products into Active in the Product Manager.

In the interim, please feel free to amend the Hong Kong Products that I added 
and add the additional Products that you may need.

I can't see the HK Weather Products in Stack, Product or Data Manager. This 
may be to do with my permissioning. In the absense of Justin, can you pls

Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
11/19/98 12:28 PM
I wanted to run this agreement by you before I sent it to Randy.  The 
Directors and officers of Argentine companies have joint and several 
liability to the shareholders and third parties for their acts as directors 
and officers and therefore what often happens is that the companies agree to 
indemnify them as long as they are acting within their scope of employment.  
I have created this form out of several documents I have run across and 
wanted to know if it looks reasonable.  I will also check into whether it 
needs to be approved by the shareholders and whether an Argentine company can 
even agree to indemnify its directors and officers in advance of any action.  
Please let me know what you think.

I'm following up with Cindy Skinner of ECT HR to try and get this resolved.  
Thanks for letting me know it was still an issue.

Mark

Mark,

I really have no idea what this is all about, but it seems to be spiralling a 
bit out of control.  I'm in NYC today, but could you call Ms Arteaga and sort 
this out?  Let me know if I need to do anything.

Thanks,

Bob - These are the only versions I have in Word format - they were probably 
modified slightly in the online version (e.g. Enron party is now EnronOnline 
LLC).

Thanks for your note - that will make packing easier.

My flight is CO4240 from Houston Intercontinental Airport arriving at 10:29 
Wednesday night - operated by Continental Express.  I don't like to take 
those smaller planes but at least this one is a jet and is a non-stop 
flight.   It makes for fewer delays and it's that much harder for them to 
lose your luggage.

Please send a copy of the Energy Gateway docs to Luis Derrota - EB838.

If they've done it, it was without consulting me.  Other than the content 
stuff (e.g. which provide links to Reuters) I don't think there is anything 
out there yet.

It has been ten very hectic days since I last broadcast an update.  As most 
of you know we have had significant issues with El Paso regarding their 
willingness to cooperate in the monetization of the Mesquite Notes we were to 
receive in the transaction.  The worst issues have revolved around the 
structure and strength of the El Paso parent contingent guarantee and the 
structure and necessary Mesquite and El Paso disclosures required to monetize 
the Notes.  Accordingly we made a proposal to El Paso on Wednesday of last 
week to change the fundamental structure of the transaction.  

Our proposal was to have El Paso provide us with a commodity contract under 
ISDA documents (but without a collateral threshold) and the usual 
unconditional parent guarantee that was "in the money" with payment terms 
identical to the deferred payments we were to receive under the Mesquite 
Notes.  El Paso obtained the necessary clearances for such a transaction 
Friday night.  We now expect to pursue this structure instead of the more 
difficult 144A monetization.  I have attached a Transaction Summary and a 
transaction diagram to help explain the specific of our proposal.  In 
addition, I have attached a revised offer analysis; we now expect slightly 
lower monetization costs.

With the 144A issues off the table we believe that we will now be able to 
sign a Transaction Agreement by the end of next week.  We also expect it to 
be much easier to satisfy by year end the resulting shorter list of 
conditions precedent to closing.

There have been some other minor changes the most significant of which is 
that Merlin will not be selling its $30mm of SubNotes as part of this 
transaction.  Please call if you have any questions.

The pulp & paper group is looking into physical trading in the Far East

taxation issues related to transacting in this region.  I've been talking to 
Peter DelVecchio and he was in the process of contacting outside help in this

already since we trade liquids in that part of the world.

Do either of you know if this information is available internally?

We have not admitted hedge funds to trade in the US because of the heightened 
regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term 
Capital Management debacle of last year.  These same issues may not apply in 
the UK.

Hi guys,

I hope you can help me.  Are there any issues with us trading with Hedge 
funds on EnronOnline?  Galtere have applied and seem to be one.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject to my comment below and to the Segregated Accounts notice (for 
metals), I approve for all products, except for US power, credit and weather.

However, in the case of the Galtere, please check with the US PCG whether 
trading with Hedge funds gives rise to any particular legal issues.

Hi there, 

Could you please approve the above?  Galtere is a US company, (Hedging fund) 
and Toyota... is also a US company (Both metals)
Thanks

smiley faces - they even have a name: emoticons.  They don't often look like

 and ordered it!  While there I found references to a number of books I 
tought you might be interested in:

the Hornblower series by C.S. Forester
the Bolitho stories from Alexander Kent
the Drinkwater series from Richard Woodman (e.g., "An Eye of the Fleet")
the Ramage series from Dudley Pope

                     by Anne Chotzinoff Grossman, Lisa Grossman Thomas

I'll be there.

Re: Commodity Futures Trading Commission: Final Rulemaking for a New
Regulatory Framework for Multilaeral Transaction Execution Facilities,

I won't need the final locations until Joya has to submit the churn request.  
Since the construction isn't scheduled to be complete until 12/22 I wouldn't 
think we'd need it until the 15th - Joya will have a better feel for how far 
in advance we need to schedule the churn.

The legal assistants (and any lawyers who start before the construction is 
done) will be put in the cubes we have.  When we run out of cubes we have 
space to build more.

One question I would have is the location of the paralegals/assistants coming

Dear Mr. Taylor:

I am putting together a conference on eCommerce:  The Law of
eBusiness, to be held in Houston, TX on May 17-18, 2001.  Hank Jones
of Fulbright & Jaworski is chairing the event, and he wanted me to invite
Enron Bandwidth's General Counsel to speak at the conference on B2B
issues.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to track this person down, so
I am wondering if you can help put me in touch with him or her.

Please give me a call or send a return email.  Thank you for your time.

Tammy:

Brent still reports to me and I believe he should be paid from my RC.  Please 
let me know if this causes a problem.

Mark

   

Mark,

Apparently there is some confusion as to who Brent Henry reports to and who's 
RC he should be paid from.  Is he still reporting to you or should he be in 
EI Legal?

Thanks.
Scott Porter@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
02/12/99 06:18 AM
To my knowledge, Brent does not work for me.  I don't believe it would be 
consistent with Enron Corp's policy to have a lawyer working for the business 
developer. ECT Legal and EI Legal need to get together to decide who Brent 
should be reporting to, but I can assure you it should not be me.  This is a 
seperate issue from who is covering Brent's costs.  I do believe he is under 
the Argentine office's cost center since he is dedicating 100% of his time 
here.  This is consistent with EISC's policy of allocating legal costs out to 
the business unit that is incurring the cost.  However, I have had no input 
into Brent's compensation or bonus and believe he considers himself to be 
reporting to ECT Legal.

Scott

	

Brent Hendry  is no longer with ECT Legal.  He works with Scott Porter and 
Don Black, he is currently in  Buenos Aires, Argentina .  
He should be in Co# 359 and RC# 0303.   

Scott - Can you please confirm that Brent Hendry works for you.  Should we 
move him out of your RC ?  

Thanks,
Rain

Importance:  High
Rain,

Per the message below from Randy Young, Brent Hendry needs to be transferred 
to ECT since he doesn't belong to EI.  He is currently sitting in one of my 
rc's and needs to be moved to ECT's.  Can you please transfer him this pay 
period before EPC closes?  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Karen
Randy Young
02/10/99 06:20 PM

Brent works for ECT legal, not EI.  He reports to Mark Taylor, an AGC in ECT 
Legal.

Randy/ Scott:

I don't know if you remember or not, but last year I had a question as to who 
Brent would report to and who's budget it should hit.
He's now in Scott rc but he's a Sr. Counsel.  Shouldn't he be in Randy's rc? 
Please advise.

Thanks,
Karen

Hi Stacy -

Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline 
location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing 
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.

Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the 
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

After discussions with the legal group, given the mandate about including the 
market opening and regulatory change conditions in all power transactions, 
whether physical or financial, it seems to be most prudent to hold off 
offering Canadian power products through the facilities of EnronOnline until 
the new year when we have more certainty around the Alberta market.

Thanks
Greg

These look OK to me.

Mark,

I have revised the financial swap term sheets that you reviewed several weeks 
ago. Could you have a look at these new versions and see if they meet your 
approval? They are for the Originators to use as a basis for their 
discussions with potential counterparties and are not meant to be binding 
documents. Thank you.

The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one 
that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  

 What should the consistent market convention for determining the first 
tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the 
premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second.  
This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the 
calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have 
to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.  
Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would 
eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I 
will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product 
description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily 
be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  

I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get 
back to you .

Thanks 

Pete

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation 
indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Thanks,

I received from Derek Bailey the Confirmation Form  and the Chilean Annex,

In case you haven't already looked at the Fee Agreement draft, here is a 
slightly revised version.  Also attached is a revised BETA.  The changes 
marked in the BETA are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my 
revisions of those comments (hopefully marked separately).  Unfortunately I 
didn't get the changes in the Fee Agreement marked.  

Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments, 
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge 
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets, 
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it 
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible 
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA 
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets 
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not 
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing 
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this 
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that 
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional 
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing 
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original 
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary 
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized 
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other 
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an 
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these 
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a 
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, 
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade 
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately 
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, 
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be 
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be 
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such 
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert 
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its 
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge 
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets 
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would 
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :

The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities 
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :

I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above 
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into. 
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am 
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information 
please call me.

One of the areas causing us legal heart-burn in the weather derivatives area 
here in the States is the insurance and re-insurance company counterparties.  
In most states there are different laws applicable to insurance companies - 
most of which are regulated - including entirely separate insolvency 
regimes.  Just another item for your radar screen.

Dear all,

All activities in Europe with regard to Weather Risk Management products have 
now formally been amalgamated into a global weather risk management group 
managed by Lynda Clemmons in Houston.  Having concluded two transactions in 
Europe, the first being the first transaction of its type in Europe with 
Scottish Hydro-Electric and a second in the Netherlands, we are encouraged 
that the product will be as successful in the European market at managing 
volume risk due to adverse weather as it has shown to be in the US.

In London, Nick Mooney will be heading the European Weather Risk Management 
group reporting into Lynda in Houston.  Nick's group will be responsible for 
supporting all European Origination groups in the pricing and structuring of 
these products.  This management structure was put in place to enable all 
European origination groups to have the maximum support on strucutring 
weather products for their clients, ensure market development information and 
intellignece is readily and easily desiminated across Euopean groups and is 
designed to maximise the value to Enron of this new and exciting market. In 
addition to supporting orignators, the Weather group will be responsible for 
developing the hedge market for Weather Derivative Transactions with 
non-energy counterparties across Europe - including the Insurance, 
Re-Insurance, Finance, Broking and Retail sectors.

This new and exciting development in the risk management arena, is another 
example of where Enron again has developed a product to manage a risk, which 
was previously not manageable by our customers.

John Sherriff

I'll be there!

One of the problems with Indian derivatives is that when foreign exchange is 
involved, Reserve Bank of India approval is required in advance of the 
transaction.  A $US deal would involve foreign exchange from an Indian 
counterparty's point of view.  Certain transactions have pre-approved status 
but an ECT commodity swap is not one of them.  I'm still trying to track down 
whether a commodity deal can be done at all, even with RBI approval.   I've 
also asked whether, if approved commodity swaps are permitted but not by ECT, 
it might  be possible to use an Indian bank or other approved dealer as an 
intermediary.

Mark,

Since the Platt's Arab Gulf FOB Naphtha Index that is being used in the 
naphtha supply contract between DPC and Glencore is in $US/MT, I think it 
would probably be best to use $US as the currency for the proposed DPC hedge. 
The standby L/C that we wouyld require DPC to post in ECT's favor would also 
be denominated in $US.

Thanks very much for this report - these are VERY helpful in keeping me up to

Importance:  High
Here is my list of some of the projects/contracts Andrea and I are involved
in or working on (recent comments are in bold):
TGS Secured Credit Facility--(Issue raised  by Don Black regarding the 
feasibility of pledging linepack gas.  We need to check with Robert George on 
this issue.)

Imbedded Capital Contracts--(Scott Porter raised the issue of developing a 
new form of template with Andrea and asked that we discuss the issue with 
Robert George.)

Distribution Contracts--The commercial group would like to have preapproved 
distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the 
customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a 
commercial bypass.  Only two distributors have had their form approved by the 
ENARGAS.  We are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other 
distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution 
contracts with the LDCs to avoid long delays.

ENARGAS Expedientes--ENARGAS has issued an order to Enron to amend three of 
its gas contracts to modify references to firm transportation and to unbundle 
the pricing.  The ENARGAS also sent a letter to our customers which we feel 
overstepped their regulatory role.  The meeting between Roberto Pensoti and 
Hector Formica was held last Thursday.  Roberto had a follow up phone 
conversation with Hector on Friday and had a meeting Monday morning with 
Alicia Federico to get a feel for the amount of resistance we will get. We 
have been given a 30 day extension to respond to the order in order to have 
meetings with the ENARGAS and try to come to some resolution on this issue. 
The first meeting will be scheduled early next week.

Neuquen Tax Assessment--Andrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information 
regarding the stamp tax assessment on the Technical Assistance Agreement 
between TGS and EPCA to George Frumkin, Anna Sepulveda and Michelle Blaine 
who will co-ordinate with TGS and Perez Companc on the strategy for 
responding to the assessment.  Michelle will call TGS outside counsel today 
in order to hire him to also represent EPCA.  EPCA has filed its response to 
Neuquen using the arguments prepared by TGS on January 27.  Michelle Blaine 
has requested information regarding what the next step by Neuquen might 
possibly be.  We will look into the issue.

Tax Lobbying--Jordan Mintz and Terry Thorn are proposing a series of meetings 
with government officials in late February and have asked Carlos Bastos to 
see if he can also arrange a meeting with Mr. Lenicov at that time.  Issues 
include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be 
lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level.  There is a 
proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the VAT 
tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax.  The focus of 
the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who 
should be involved in the actual lobbying process.  Jordan Mintz is handing 
off the responsibility he had assumed on this issue to Jim Ginty.  Jordan has 
asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can set up a meeting with Mr. Lenicov on 
March 11th or 12th since Terry Thorn can be in Buenos Aires on those days.

Transportation Capacity Release Guidelines--Must review and comment on new 
ENARGAS proposed guidelines by February 5.  Comments were made on February 5.

Vandenfil--Vandenfil has filed for a pre-bankruptcy proceeding which has not 
yet been "opened" by the court due to the January recess.  For the last three 
months Vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending them
termination notices with a two business day cure period.    The most likely
scenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will 
be "continued" by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing 
deliveries of gas.  After the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not 
been served notice that our contract is "continued" within 30 days we would 
be allowed to terminate the contract.  One of the risks that we face with 
this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate 
the contract claiming we are providing a public service.

Imasa Bid--Format of Enron's original proposal structure changed.  Enron and 
Albanesi submitted joint termsheet to Central Puerto in November  where Enron 
proposed signing two contracts with Central Puerto, one for the supply of all 
the gas transportation and another for the supply for 60 percent of the gas 
requirements and Albanesi proposed two contracts, one for supplying 40 
percent of the supply of the gas and another for the building of the pipeline 
spur.  Central Puerto is studying the proposals and has not responded as of 
January 25, 1999.

Dow Pipeline Spur Feasibility Study--Enron and Dow are studying the 
feasibility of building a pipeline between TGS and two affiliates of Dow. 
Issues include determining whether our CEIASA shareholder and owners 
agreements preclude Enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs 
that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory 
guidelines.  Andrea will be putting together a short report based on her 
meeting with Nestor Martinez.   A team meeting consisting of legal, 
regulatory, commercial, credit and structuring met yesterday to discuss the 
broad parameters of the Dow spur proposal.  The commercial group is preparing 
a first draft of a build, operate and finance termsheet that they would like 
to present to the customer on Thursday to be reviewed by Robert George. 
Credit is still doing its analysis of the two proposed counterparties.

Contract Review--Preliminary gas contract reviews for Central Puerto and Ave 
Fenix for Rob Rice and Federico Cerisoli.

Gas Deals:
Chauvco--20 day gas supply contract being drafted
Cerro VanGuardia--Amendment to the gas sale agreement being drafted to cover 
negotiated changes to the take or pay provisions.
Bagley--Two Offer letters sent to two Bagley entities for review, Enron was 
not the low bidder.  I have been asked by to look into how other "marketers" 
are avoiding the turnover tax and thus be more competitive than we are.  The 
customer is looking at the relative risks between firm distribution and 
interruptable distribution but is running up against a deadline for actually 
requesting a contract template for distribution services.  The contract is 
slated to begin March 23, however, the distributor has 30 days to respond for 
requests for distribution services.
Total--Spot master agreement proposed for transactions out of Neuquen.  Short 
term draft offer for gas out of Chubut being reviewed by Total.  A separate 
one year supply contract template supplied by Total is being reviewed.  The 
customers template contains the same type of language that gave us Antitrust 
trouble in the PCR contract.  Peidra Buena--Gas sale agreement for peaking
gas.    Final offer sent and Gas has started flowing.  We are now working on
a one year contract.  A termsheet has been sent to the customer. 
Dow--Negotiating offer letter format for sale of gas to two Dow affiliates. 
Gas deal is related to but independent of the spur issue.  A mark up of draft 
has been received the end of last week, Dow indicates that further comments 
are to be sent soon.

Power Deals:
We need to draft an output marketing form of contract for the purchase of 
electricity.

Argentine Signatories:
Scott Neal has approved a new structure for signatories in Argentina.  I will 
work with Hope Duggan firm on the new POA's.

Yes - it's definitely time to think about this.  My suggestion would be that 
we try to get Don to pay the expenses since the trip would be necessary 
regardless of who she was working for (EI or ECT).  Of course, if he balks, 
we'll foot the bill.

Mark, my secondment is coming up in a few weeks time. Sorry to trouble you 
about mundanities  but whom do I contact about arranging a desk, telephone pc 
etc. HR have told me it would be one of the assistants in ECT Legal. Any 
ideas? tks 

Here is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, 
insertions in bold).  Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any 
questions or comments:

A:   The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option 
contracts.  
SP:  What's a futures contract?
A:  It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of  commodity through a 
regulated  exchange.
SP:  How is the contract different than a non-futures contract?
A:  Ahem,   just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts 
forward or over the counter contracts.  The big difference is that the 
forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not.
SP:  I though the futures contracts went to delivery.  I remember getting all 
messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry 
Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans 
dumped in their front yards?
A:  Well, er,  yes they do sometimes  go to delivery, but they are not really 
supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery.  They are supposed to  
more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial 
transactions.  It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes 
the futures contract.
SP:  Well lets get to the point,  why are physical buy sells so bad?
A:  That's easy.  Because they look like futures contracts.  They are not 
intended to go to delivery.  And if you are trading in futures contracts you 
are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. 
SP:  So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical 
deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are 
trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC?
A:  You've got it.  But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a 
futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not 
only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law 
against you to get out of performing.  So you can think of each contract like 
that as having written a free option.
SP:  Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward 
contract?
A:  What do you mean?
SP:  Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 
29 days, would we have a futures contract?
A:  Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.   I'm telling you once and for all that 
physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the 
hell out of my office!--

Is this the basic idea and if so,  how much can we blend physical into it to 
cross the line into the domain of the forward contract?  --Christian 

Basically, yes.  A lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also 
the parties' intentions.  If we do not intend to make and take delivery, if 
we intend to settle financially - or even intend to just have the option to 
settle financially, we have a problem.  The closest thing we have to an 
exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to 
deliver.  That is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one 
party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform.  We argue 
that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good 
faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when 
there is a failure to make or take delivery.  Unfortunately, in the power 
world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out.  However, 
each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation 
to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen - we do not 
enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out.  The 
book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the 
book-out.  In fact, if we didn't want to book them out, we could stand on our 
legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery 
(although I assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our 
scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time).

I am also admitted in New York which has recently instituted a CLE 
requirement.

Marc,

I agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of 
L/C we would require.  Unfortunately, given the nature of this transaction we 
can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit.  Let me know 
if you're ready to send that and I'll get started on it right away - 
shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready.

Mark,

FYI: Ram Srivastav is the President of DPC. Can we send DPC the format of the 
Stdby L/C to advance the credit risk portion? We're not committing to 
actually putting a derivative in place, just familiarizing them with the 
necessary tools. The legal risk aspect will be covered when we get their 
outside counsel opinion sent to us. Please let me know. While I feel strongly 
that we need to cover all of ECT's bases, especially when dealing with the 
Indians, I don't want to appear to hold up the process. Let me know what you 
think.

Marc

While the legal openions are coming - please continue working the rest of the 
issues and Dont forget that MSEB has to understand and agree to any of these 
arrangements.
Ram

______________________________ Reply Separator

Mood Stamp:  FYI
We very much look forward to being able to help DPC mitigate it's fuel price 
risk by implementing a derivative through ECT.

ECT's counsel has advised me that the format for the Standby Letter of Credit 
to cover ECT's exposure on the derivatives will be sent to you/DPC as soon as 
you provide us with an opinion from outside (non-DPC) Indian counsel on the 
legality of commodity derivatives in India.

Pursuant to the above, please obtain a formal opinion from outside (non-DPC) 
Indian counsel on the legality of commodity derivatives in India, and send it 
to myself  at your earliest convenience.

Thanking you in advance,

Marc

Marc,

Here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail, which I would send to all those 
copied on your note to me.  What do you think?

Marc,

We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity 
derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.  We have had that advice 
updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.  The 
result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside 
counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the 
transaction can proceed.  While I have no legal objection to sending a form 
of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go 
through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.

Mark  

Debbie:

I think we should probably do a special form for this particular 
transaction.  I've left a voice-mail to Marc to that effect.  There are 
several issues here that don't exist in our run-of-the-mill deals that should 
be covered in the L/C language.

Mark

In light of the rising frequency of human-grizzly bear conflicts, the
Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and
fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the
field.
We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing, so as
not to startle bears that aren't expecting them.  We also advise outdoorsmen
to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.  It is
also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.  Outdoorsmen
should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung.
Black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur.
Grizzly bear dung has little bells in it and smells like pepper.

You guys around this weekend?

We have asked for a legal opinion from the counterparty's Indian counsel but 
have not received it yet.  That's the reason I'd like to do a special form of 
L/C - we need to add some language that indicates enforceability of the 
underlying agreement is not a prerequisite to a draw.

Marc - I know Bill well - give me a call (713)853-7459.

   

Mark/Steve,
Do either one of you know "Bill Bradford".  He is the risk management area.
I'm interviewing with him on Wednesday and just wonder what to expect.

Thanks!

I wanted to run this agreement by you before I sent it to Randy.  The 
Directors and officers of Argentine companies have joint and several 
liability to the shareholders and third parties for their acts as directors 
and officers and therefore what often happens is that the companies agree to 
indemnify them as long as they are acting within their scope of employment.  
I have created this form out of several documents I have run across and 
wanted to know if it looks reasonable.  I will also check into whether it 
needs to be approved by the shareholders and whether an Argentine company can 
even agree to indemnify its directors and officers in advance of any action.  
Please let me know what you think.

Hmmm, interesting question.  Most of the guys I've interviewed have gotten 
dressed up even on casual days, but then we're pretty causal every day so 
it's hard to tell.  I don't think he'd mind if you called to ask.  That 
department is a little dressier than my area (they actually wear ties most of 
the time Mon - Thurs) but I think Friday is pretty casual there - and you 
have a pretty good excuse.  It might depend on who else (if anyone) you'll be 
seeing.  The reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior 
guys (don't know which one, but can find out if you want) on that floor is 
always in a suit & tie.  If you're also talking to him it might make sense to 
bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview.

Sorry for the delay - we won't be able to go with you tomorrow night - hope 
you have fun anyway!

   

Mark,
We're going to the Vince Gill concert on Thursday night, and the persons
that were joining us had to go out of town.  Let me know if you would like
to join us (2 tickets).

Mark--thanks for taking the time to talk me through our power hedge deal with 
AEI.  The more I think about it, the more I think that using your Omnibus 
Agreement is appropriate to this deal.  Who can get me an electronic copy of 
that form so I can take a look at it?  I'd like to be able to review it and 
then attempt to fit my deal into it.  Thanks.  MDS

I left you a voice mail about this contract.  Can you let me know who the 
best person would be to review one of these for Brent?

Brent, attached you will find the translation of the contract you e-mailed me 
yesterday.

 - contrato de procesamientobrent.doc

The report of my absence is premature - I will be in our South American 
offices Mon. - Thurs. of next week but am in the office in Houston all of 
this week.

I am also not aware of any memoranda on point.  I have seen the issue 
addressed in an off-hand way in one or more articles (not really legal 
analysis) and will keep my eyes open for those.  The bottom line is usually 
that insurance requires an actual loss and proof of that loss before a claim 
can be made on the insurance while in the case of the derivative, no loss 
needs to be shown, only the actual weather conditions described in the 
agreement.

I am not aware of any ECT commissioned memo addressing why OTC Weather 
Transactions are not considered contracts for insurance. Mark may know 
something I don't but FYI- he is out of the office on business for the next 2 
weeks.

We do have a memo from Cadwalader which discusses whether a weather contract 
can be considered a "commodity" within the meaning of the U.S. Commodities 
Exchange Act. I will fax that over to you now for info.

Mark:

 Just a brief note to follow up with additional information regarding the 
Global Information Site mentioned by Mr. Fishkin, and my comments to that 
section.   As I mentioned in my memo, Sheri Cromwell has been gathering data 
and working with the Internet group to come up with the initial draft for the 
ECT Legal website.    Sheri completed the first draft last Friday and asked 
me who will need to be involved in the review and approval of this 
information.  I mentioned to Sheri that you and Tana were working on a 
special project and that one of the goals was to create a Global Information 
Site or something similar, and that I had mentioned to you as well that she 
was gathering some data for that particular purpose.

 I'm not sure what your plans are regarding the Intranet Site, but since 
Sheri has already done this work I thought I would let you know in case you 
and Tana are interested in talking to Sheri and reviewing her work.  Sheri 
has a lot of good ideas and she seems to enjoy project development 
responsibilities, not to mention that she's had the opportunity to establish 
good relationships with the Internet team.   

Thanks.
Nony

Robert:

Actually, I will be out of the office Mon - Wed of next week.  Tana is 
expecting you and will be able to get you started on the swap training 
program.  You will probably need to give her name at the receptionist in the 
lobby - her extension is x33399.  If she isn't around, Jan Dobernecker 
(x33427) will at least be able to get you in the building.  Your office will 
be EB3847 and your phone number will be (713)853-6121.  Have a good flight!

I will be participating, possibly with Brent Hendry (Brent - are you 
available?), from Buenos Aires.  Will we need to set up a conference call so 
that both London and B.A. can be connected?  It's also possible that Martin 
will be back in Oslo by then.  I'm not sure what his plans are re 
participating.

Regarding the agenda, I would appreciate an update from someone on the 
internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, I'm wondering if there are 
enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe like we might face 
here and what research has been done to date in that area.  Since at least 
one of us will be on the line from Argentina, we might do a quick update on 
some of the significant problems we are having with the regulators there.

you up just before 7:00.  Let me know if that's a problem.

Michelle is going to discuss this with Sharon Butcher (an outside labor 
lawyer we use).  Apparently there is some corporate policy against 
indemnifying employees but she understands there may be a distinction here 
due to the nature of Argentine law in the area.   We'll keep you posted.

before 7:00.  Let me know if this presents any problems.

As requested, a thumb-nail sketch of the above. As you will see, the sky is 
generally blue , but follow up work will be required in one or two countries 
before we can give the all-clear.

Executive Summary

Generally, only the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands (options and 
swaptions only) and Spain (options only) are countries/transaction types in 
respect of which we cannot begin marketing and trading now. 

In Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the UK, the marketing and 
trading of ALL weather derivatives products can commence immediately. 

In France, the marketing and trading of ALL weather products can begin when 
we receive acceptance from SFA of our French passport application (in the 
next few weeks).

The marketing of, and trading in, Dutch weather swaps and Spanish swaps and 
swaptions can commence immediately.
1. are weather derivatives regulated ( eg marketing restrictions/ 
licence/capital requirements etc)?
2.  could they be construed to be unauthorised insurance contracts?
3.  could they be construed to be gaming contracts?

Czech Republic  ---  1.  Totally unregulated
                                               2.  Possibly, yes (especially 
options) with criminal consequences if unauthorised
                                               3.  Unlikely if transacted for 
commercial purpose
                                         
France  ---  1.  Regulated in the same way as commodity derivatives (ISD 
passport available to EEFT)
                        2.  Unlikely
                        3.  No

Germany ---  1. Totally unregulated
                            2.  Not insurance contracts
                            3.  Carve out from gaming law possibly not 
available, but no problem if in good faith believe c'party is hedging 
(English law may improve analysis)

Hungary  ---  1.  Totally unregulated
                         2.  Highly unlikely (if individually negotiated)
                         3.  Highly unlikely

Italy  ---  1.  Totally unregulated
                  2.  No
                  3.  Probably not if transacted for commercial reason

Netherlands  ---  1.  Same as commodity derivatives, but capital requirements 
may apply to options and swaptions (we are checking this)
                                       2.  Unlikely
                                       3.  Unlikely if transacted for a valid 
commercial purpose (but we will clarify in light of possible criminal 
sanctions)

Norway  ---  1. Totally unregulated
                          2.  Probably not insurance contracts, but may be 
prudent to check with Banking Securities and Insurance Commission
                          3.  No problem if in good faith believe c'party is 
transacting for sound financial/commercial reason

Poland  ---   1.  No specific requirements now (eg under the Energy law)
                          2.  Unlikely, but unclear: need to check with 
Minister of Finance (English law would not help) -  up to 2 yrs' imprisonment 
for breaches
                          3.  Unlikely if transacted for commercial reasons, 
but need to check with  Minister of Finance (risk of 3 yrs' imprisonment and 
loss of power licence)

Spain  ---  1.  Totally unregulated if OTC 
                      2.  Swaps and swaptions, no. Options, unclear (risk 
higher if a premium is payable and contract a hedge). Result: options may be 
void
                      3.  No problem if one party transacts for valid 
commercial purpose

Sweden  ---  1.  Regulated in the same way as commodity derivatives
                            2.  No 
                            3.  No  

United Kingdom  ---  1. Regulated by SFA (must be transacted through EEFT etc)
                                             2.  No
                                             3.  No, provided one part 
transacts by way of business (Enron will).

Let's discuss this note before we distribute it more widely (including any 
comments you may have).

Carolina,

I have finally received my tickets.  I will arrive at Ezeiza on United 
Airlines flight #761 on Sunday, March 14 at 11:15 a.m.  Can you arrange to 
have a driver meet me at the airport?  I will be staying at the Sheraton.  
Thank you very much for your help.

Mark

I tried dialing 8-9-0-0- and 8-9-0 right after we finished talking and 
neither one works.  We'll have to keep hoping.

Thanks for your help - is Scott is in Houston today?  Maybe I could meet with 
him here.  Any chance he will be back in BA by Tuesday? (I am scheduled to 
leave Tuesday night.)

Scott Neal will not be in BA on monday (he will probably make it for 
Wednesday).

Don Black's agenda is open so I added this meeting on his schedule at 10:00am.

Have a nice trip and I will send you a car to pick you up.

I believe that Marcus von Bock in the Legal Dept is working on this and the 
huge project concerning the legal  issues surrounding the internet around the

Mark:

 Mark Taylor would like to have an update from someone in the London group 
regarding the internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, he is 
wondering if there are enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe 
like we might face here and what research has been done to date in that 
area.  I remember that during our January meeting you briefly discussed 
websites for Germany and Switzerland for power trading as well as procedures 
for contracting electronically, etc.  Would you be able to address Mark 
Taylor's questions in our upcoming meeting on Tuesday?  If not, could you 
help me identify someone else in the group that can address this issue?

Many thanks.

Dow Jones will this month launch a new power index, known as the Central 
European Power Index (CEPI). The participating companies include Enron, 
PreussenElektra, Electrabel and VASA. The delivery point will be a point on 
the PreussenElektra grid.

CEPI is the second Central European index to be introduced by Dow Jones, the 
first being SWEP.

=ABB: Power Derivatives Trading In Germany Still Long Way Off

 [Dow Jones News Service via DowVision ? Rcvd: Mar 18, 05:51 AM ] 

By Axel Revheim 

OSLO (Dow Jones)--Derivatives trading in the German electricity market won't 
take off until certain structural blocks in the
power industry are cleared, paving the way for a spot market to develop as a 
first step, Jonas Kollberg, head of ABB Financial
Energy told Dow Jones this week. 

ABB Financial Energy is a division of Swiss-Swedish engineering and 
construction conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.
(ABBBY). 

A small number of large, vertically integrated German electricity companies 
are effectively hindering the development of free
trade - presenting a stumbling block by both owning the production of 
electricity and controlling the means of transmission, or
grids. 

Currently, if a third-party wants to transport power, it must separately 
negotiate access and prices for each grid - an impractical
arrangement for the spot market, Kollberg said. 

'The advantage of the Nordic model is that you have great liquidity for 
derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged system
price. You also have several producers creating a well-functioning spot 
market. I can't see how they're going to solve this in
Germany. They have too many isolated (monopolized) grid areas,' Kollberg 
said. 

Financial power contracts like futures, forwards and other derivatives are 
based on an underlying reference price, often an
average of spot price throughout a region or country. There won't be any 
power derivatives trading in Germany before an
acknowledged reference price is established, he said. 

A Liberalized Market In Law Only 

The practice among German utilities of pricing electricity transmission based 
on the distance traveled, is a powerful barrier to
trading, Kollberg said. In the fully liberalized Norwegian power market, for 
example, independent producers are charged fees
for access to grids based on an established point system. Producers pay the 
same tariff, regardless of how far the electricity is
transported. 

Germany's new energy law, in effect since April 1998, paves the way for all 
German consumers to choose who supplies them
with electricity. However, without clear, published grid access tariffs or a 
national reference price, few customers have, in
reality, been able to move away from their regional supplier. 

No decision has been made yet as to how Germany will organize its spot market 
for electricity sales. The first German electricity
bourse is likely to be set up in either Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg or 
Leipzig. But interested parties such as the Deutsche
Boerse in Frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be 
in place before futures trading can be
introduced. 

Nord Pool, the joint Swedish-Norwegian power exchange, recently joined up 
with Germany's Landesbank Sachsen
Girozentrale, the Leipzig town authority and the Saxony state government to 
establish a power exchange in Leipzig. 

Using expertise gained in the Nordic market, Kjetil Knutsen at Nord Pool 
Consulting told Dow Jones that the plan is to develop
a spot market in Germany along the lines of the Nordic model. 

There will be one system price for the whole of Germany, based on spot prices 
in the seven regions which are controlled by
Germany's 'Verbund' regional transmission companies, he said. 

'One can solve the spot price problem,' he said. The question isn't whether 
Germany will have a functioning spot market, but
rather when, he said. 

Separation Of Producers, Grids The Key 

Even if Germany eventually establishes a reference price, the problem of 
vertical integration remains. One needs unbundling
(between producers and grids) to open the way for competition, ABB's Kollberg 
said. 

According to ABB's own analysis, between 78% and 83% of German power 
transmission lines are owned and controlled by
the big German power producers. 

As long as domestic producers have such grid control, power imports and 
exports from Germany won't be free, said Kollberg. 

Any overcapacity of French power generation could be imported to the benefit 
of German consumers. however, because
German producers control transmission, the tendency is to shield the domestic 
market from competition, observers said. 

French electricity imports could lower prices sharply for German end-users of 
electricity. According to Kollberg, there's an
overcapacity of 40 terawatts of electricity in France, while Germany too has 
an overcapacity of 31 TW. 

I understand that Robin Jordan has taken care of this in my absence.  If you 
still need anything from me, please let me know.

Mark

Just to clarify what I need from you:

1.  Make any changes for the folks in your group, ECT-Financial Trading, on 
the list I sent you, including e-mail addresses; and

2.  Have any NEW attorneys (Mark Elliott, Elizabeth Sager, Paul Simons and 
Shari Stack) fill out the Professional Biographies Form (attached to the back 
of the fax I sent yesterday); and

3.  Return any changes and Professional Biographies forms to me (Room 4804a) 
no later than Tuesday, December 1, 1998.

Thanks!

Sara

I discussed this matter with Brent yesterday and I believe the correct title 
for Andrea is "Attorney".

Importance:  High
I have been requested by Robin Jordan to review and update our group 
information for the Legal Pictorial.
In the information I received about Andrea Calo, she has the position of 
"Senior Counsel". Would you be so kind so as to confirm whether this is right 
?

Thanks for your co-operation.

Hey Bob - 

Her name is Kartini Muljadi.  I haven't done a good job of staying in touch 
but the last numbers I have for her are:

Phone: 62-21-525-6968
Fax: 62-21-525-5561

If those don't work, you might check with Yao who has stayed in touch with 
one of the other lawyers in that firm.  He has moved over to Enron  
International where he is responsible for their African legal affairs.  I 
know he is out of town (in Africa) right now and unfortunately I'm not sure 
if his e-mail address has changed.  His phone number is the same - maybe his 
secretary could put you in touch with him.

Good luck!

Mark

P.S. - If you do get in touch with Kartini, please send her my regards.  I'm 
pretty sure she still likes me in spite of the way Skadden's relationship 
with her ended.

Is this something one of your people should look at?
This is a rough draft of a new form of supply agreement for electricity that 
I sent to a potential supplier, Central Termica Alto Valle S.A. for their 
comments.  The Termination section is still under review.

Could you guys please get in touch with Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo & send 
her copies of our forms that might be useful in coming up with appropriate 
documentation for this transaction.  Sara - you should probably discuss with 
her the regulatory situation and make sure we can actually do this.  Brent 
may have some information as well.

Mark / Tana,

The origination team in Brasil is about to close Enron's first electricity 
trading transaction in Brasil (in fact it will be also the first one in 
Brasil). Just to summarise, we are negotiating the purchase of 3MW for 30 
days to sell it to an industrial customer.

I spoke with Andrea Bertone (our internal legal counsel) and we thought that 
the most efficient way to develop the contracts between Enron, the seller and 
the purchaser of power would be to use the model of contracts that Enron 
currently applies for the electricity trading transaction in the US, and then 
adapt them considering the commercial conditions of the deal as well as the 
Brazilian regulatory aspects. Therefore, I would like to ask you to send us a 
copy of such contracts, and since the power will be available on 01 April, I 
would really appreciate if you could send them asap.

Thanks and regards,

Marcelo Parodi

Hey Marc - any chance you guys might like to join us on a one week sailing

Anita:

I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC 
company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very 
dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.  My vague memory is that only 
financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then 
there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.  Do you remember this and can 
you refresh my recollection?

Mark
Mark,

Cynthia Scneider recommended I check with you on the ability of Chinese 
government-owned entities to enter into derivative contracts with Enron.  Has 
ECT done any research on China?  Please see the e-mail below for details on 
counterparty, size, term, etc.

Thanks,

Cynthia,

The EI LNG Group is looking at providing LNG price risk management for China. 
Could you please confirm whether China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and 
China State Power Corp. are creditworthy counterparties?  Before Doug and I 
talk to the traders I want to see whether we would even be willing to sell 
LNG risk management to them.

The structure the group is most likely interested in is 500,000 MT to 
1,000,000 MT per year for five to 20 years (depending on what our traders are 
comfortable with).  I imagine the Chinese would be interested in a cap or 
collar, and not a fixed price.

What other info do you need for a quick estimate?

Thanks,
Heather

That schedule sounds good to me.

If Airlines Sold Paint......

BUYING PAINT FROM A HARDWARE STORE

Customer: Hi. How much is your paint?

Clerk: We have regular quality for $12 a gallon and premium for $18. How many 
gallons would you like?

Customer: Five gallons of regular quality, please.

Clerk: Great. That will be $60 plus tax.

BUYING PAINT FROM AN AIRLINE

Customer: Hi, how much is your paint?

Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends.

Customer: Depends on what?

Clerk: Actually, a lot of things.

Customer: How about giving me an average price?

Clerk: Wow, that's too hard a question. The lowest price is $9 a gallon, and 
we have 150 different prices up to $200 a gallon.

Customer: What's the difference in the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.

Customer: Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint.

Clerk: Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do you intend to 
use it?

Customer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off.

Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.

Customer: What? When would I have to paint in order to get the $9 version?

Clerk: That would be in three weeks, but you will also have to agree to start 
painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least 
Sunday.

Customer: You've got to be kidding!

Clerk: Sir, we don't kid around here. Of course, I'll have to check to see if 
we have any of that paint available before I can sell it to you.

Customer: What do you mean check to see if you can sell it to me? You have 
shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there.

Clerk: Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have it. It may be 
the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on any given 
weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12.

Customer: You mean the price went up while we were talking!

Clerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of times a 
day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint 
yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing to happen 
again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. How many gallons 
do you want?

Customer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe I should buy six 
gallons just to make sure I have enough.

Clerk: Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the paint and then don't 
use it, you will be liable for penalties and possible confiscation of the 
paint you already have.

Customer: What?

Clerk: That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your kitchen, 
bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the 
bedroom, you will be in violation
of our tariffs.

Customer: But what does it matter to you whether I use all the paint? I 
already paid you for it!

Clerk: Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the way it is. We 
make plans based upon the idea that you will use all the paint, and when you 
don't, it just causes
us all sorts of problems.

Customer: This is crazy! I suppose something terrible will happen if I don't 
keep painting until after Saturday night!

Clerk: Yes, sir, it will.

Customer: Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy my paint.

Clerk: That won't do you any good, sir. We all have the same rules. Thanks 
for painting with our airline.

Looks good to me.

I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for 
you appears to be at some other company entirely.  Please feel free to call 
me once you get this note to discuss further.

The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in 
the US.  There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul 
Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in 
London.  On that system, we would have been able to trade financial contracts 
electronically.  The problem was that our counterparties were also US 
entities and, in some instances, trading from the US.  I believe that the 
advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all 
outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.   Of course, 
all of this relates to derivatives trading.  If the system you have in mind 
will be for the physical commodities, we should include Jeff Hodge in the 
discussion.

I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.  I am copying 
Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has 
already dealt with similar issues.

Mark, in the course of our effort to establish internet-based click-and trade 
business for a number of commodities (mainly gas, power) in the main markets 
of Europe (and with respect to pulp&paper also possibly the US), I think, it 
is necessary to evaluate the CFTC issues. I understand that Cadwalader has 
given some advice earlier this year re. OMLX and think it may be best to 
contact them. Who do you think, I should contact (I understand, the person we 
earlier dealt with was a David Mitchell) and how do you want to play this 
contact. Greetings, Marcus.

One issue to keep in mind regarding membership in this exchange:  if there is 
no clearing house and the exchange is the counterparty to all transactions, 
who bears the liability when a third party defaults?  We certainly need to 
know if it is the exchange membership.  If not, how is the liability limited 
and on whose credit would we be relying if we trade?

Mark

Just to let you know that last Thursday, we submitted, in the name of Enron 
Capital & Trade Resources Limited, an application at very short notice to 
become one of the first members of the Amsterdam Power Exchange.

The Exchange still has many outstanding issues to resolve re its mode of 
operation and I shall keep you informed of progress.  The Exchange is due to 
go live, however, at the beginning of May 1999 but our feeling is that there 
are so many substantial issues remaining to be resolved that either it shall 
not hit this deadline or, if it does, it will be in a very chaotic state.   
However please note that initially it is proposed that the Exchange is simply 
for day-ahead physical power deals; the Exchange is the counterparty to 
transactions and there is no separate clearing house.

It is proposed that at some future stage a financial futures' market will 
develop when our SFA-regulated entity will then have to become an Exchange 
member - but this is some way off. 

Kind regards

Mark 

Justin:

The mention of Statoil made me think of Norway.  Alliance doesn't sound like 
a Norwegian entity so it's probably not an issue here, but do you think we 
should discourage large volume and long term multiple trades with Norwegian 
entities given our continuing uncertainty over netting there?

Mark

Justin Boyd
04/08/99 09:27 AM
We are discussing with Alliance Gas Limited (Statoil is their parent) a 
potential long-term, large volume gas swaption. Brief details are :

Enron as option seller
Option exercise period: present to December 1999
Term: 5-6 years, starting 2001
Notional monthly volumes: 18,000,000 therms

In the meantime, we have been negotiating a fully-termed ISDA Master, 
including Credit Support Annex, and seem to be close to finalising this.  As 
to the swaption deal itself, we await their Board's response.

Marcus - 

Here is the note I sent on 3/31.  David Mitchell is definitely the right guy.

Mark
Marcus:

I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for 
you appears to be at some other company entirely.  Please feel free to call 
me once you get this note to discuss further.

The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in 
the US.  There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul 
Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in 
London.  On that system, we would have been able to trade financial contracts 
electronically.  The problem was that our counterparties were also US 
entities and, in some instances, trading from the US.  I believe that the 
advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all 
outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.   Of course, 
all of this relates to derivatives trading.  If the system you have in mind 
will be for the physical commodities, we should include Jeff Hodge in the 
discussion.

I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.  I am copying 
Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has 
already dealt with similar issues.

Mark, in the course of our effort to establish internet-based click-and trade 
business for a number of commodities (mainly gas, power) in the main markets 
of Europe (and with respect to pulp&paper also possibly the US), I think, it 
is necessary to evaluate the CFTC issues. I understand that Cadwalader has 
given some advice earlier this year re. OMLX and think it may be best to 
contact them. Who do you think, I should contact (I understand, the person we 
earlier dealt with was a David Mitchell) and how do you want to play this 
contact. Greetings, Marcus.

Christian Yoder

04/13/99 04:30 PM
Mark,
I am heading into another CFTC related analysis and desparately need another 
quick primer.  I would be very greatful if you could edit the following 
conversation and send it back to me like you did last time.  I kept that copy 
and it has proven to be invaluable.

 Know it All:  Yeah that CFTC stuff is pretty complicated.  You have to 
remember though that it is the option of settling financially that 
distinguishes the futures contract.  If you do a physical contract that has 
the option to settle financially it is an illegal futures contract if it 
isn't done on a regulated exchange  and it is just like giving the other guy 
a free option to termiate for illegality. So the risk in doing these things 
is that your counterparty can get out on the basis of illegality and 
secondly, you might find yourself suddenly regulated by the CFTC.  This risk 
is not to be confused with the other kind of risk which is where you write a 
mandatory financial transaction but wrap it up in physical clothing.  This is 
basically the risk of doing an unauthorized derivitive transaction and again, 
depending on the counterparty, you may have given a free option to terminate 
for lack of authorization. 

Tormented: Okay, okay, I think I've got that part, but what's all this option 
crap that people keep adding into the forumula?  They always say you can 
trade this and that and then they throw in the options.  Are options over the 
counter or under the counter or not on the counter or regulated or what?

Know it All:  Can't you remember this stuff.  I get tired of repeating it.  
Certain kinds of All commodity options are regulated and certain kinds 
aren't. Can't you just get that once and for all?

Tormented:  No.  I've got optionality dislexia.  What kind of option is How 
are options regulated?  I see our traders doing options all the time and we 
just write them up in our confirmation letters.  There's no big deal about 
CFTC or regulation.  What's the problem?

Know it All:  Well its like this:  if it is an option to do a futures 
contract it has to be done on the Exchange.  Any other options are off 
exchange.  It's just that simple.  Off exchange commodity options can only be 
done if the offeree (that's the guy receiving the offer) is a commercial 
user, producer, processor or merchant handling the underlying commodity.

Tormented:  Hmmm.  I'll have to think about that.

Scott:

I have a call scheduled with Martin for tomorrow morning to discuss these 
CFTC  issues.  I'll let you know how it goes.

I have also not forgotten your request for my view on Martin's tenure in 
Houston.  I have mixed feelings that are difficult to put down in writing and 
I'm hoping we can take a few minutes in New Orleans to discuss.

Mark

Sorry about the previous message (re: bankruptcy legislation).  Please 
ignore.

Heather:

Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:

Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into 
derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:
a. banks;
b. non-bank financial institutions ("NBFI"); and
c. foreign invested enterprises ("FIE").

Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative 
transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned 
enterprises ("WFOE"); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures ("SFJV") and 
include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There 
are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into 
derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned 
enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact 
through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil 
Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the 
authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.

I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a 
year or two ago on these issues.  If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd 
be happy to send a copy on.

I put a call in to Cadwalader this afternoon to see if they had someone 
following these bills in DC........great minds!

I spoke with Jeff about this today and will take a look at what they've 
done.  From what I have seen thus far, it looks as if they have attempted to 
deal with the setoff issue by revising the definitions of swap agreement, 
securities contract and  forward contract  and creating a new defintion 
called "masternetting agreement".  Is it worth having one of our outside 
firms look at these bills?
Carol

Martin:

Mark H. has asked me to participate in another conference call scheduled for 
9:00 a.m. Houston time tomorrow which will almost certainly last at least an 
hour and possibly more.  If you think 30 minutes will be enough, I wonder if 
we could reschedule our call for 8:30 (3:30 your time)?  

As discussed.
Carol St Clair
04/22/99 10:31 AM
Jeff:
I have reviewed the House and Senate versions of the proposed bankruptcy code 
amendments as they pertain to derivatives and discussed them with Mark Taylor 
this morning and here is our read on what they have done and the effect on 
Enron :

1) Both versions added a concept of "master netting agreement" as a new 
definition and as an add-on to the definitions of forward contract, swap 
agreement, repo agreement  and securities contract..  This definition, I 
believe, describes agreements like the ISDA Master  Agreement.

2) Both versions amend Section 362(b) (the exceptions to the automatic stay) 
to provide for a concept that permits setoffs with respect to amounts due and 
claims under one or more master netting agreements or any contract or 
agreement that is subject to such master netting agreements.  Mark and I 
think that through this provsion, cross-product netting would be permitted to 
the extent our physical and financial contracts separately or collectively 
come under a master netting agreement.  We wanted to confirm that that was 
the intent of this language since it is not entirely clear from the drafted 
language how this would work if for example we had separate netting 
agreements for our physical and financial contracts.  In addition, as 
currently drafted, the only caveat to this setoff right is that these rights 
are derivative of the setoff rights that are permitted by Sections 362 (b) 6 
(forward contarcts), 7 (repos) and 17 (swaps) with respect to each individual 
contract.    This may still present some problems for us in that no 
amendments were made to Section 362 (b) 6 which permits setoffs with respect 
to forward contracts but only to the extent that our claim against the debtor 
is for a margin payment or a settlement payment .  We were hoping to see an 
amendment to this Section that  broadened this language to include any type 
of payment that would be due from the debtor under a forward contract  since 
we are still unclear as to what a "settlement" payment means.  If you look at 
Section 362 (b) 17 which deals with swaps, this language is much broader and 
it was our hope that the setoff language for forward contracts could track 
the setoff language for swaps.  Also, we were hoping that the setoff language 
for forward contarcts would apply to anyone taht was a party to a forward 
contract and not just "forward contract merchants" as currently drafted.  
Again, the swap setoff language has a concept of "swap participant" that is 
much broader.

3) Finally, we like the fact that the definition of "swap agreement" was 
expanded, but are concerned with the new language and how it would apply to 
our newer products such as weather derivatives since in order to fit within 
the new definition, it must be something that is currently or in the future 
"regularly" entered into in the swap market.  There are some further 
revisions to that definition which I want to discuss with you as well.

In summary, while this language gives us some stronger argumants with respect 
to "cross-product" netting, we feel that it doesn't go far enough.  Mark has 
called Cadwalader to get their read on the draft language.  Call me when 
convenient so that we can discuss what the next step for us may be.

Carol

 

Thank you both for the very quick turn-around.   Yes, I agree and hope that 
OM will consent to the proposed changes.

Martin, many thanks for your swift comments on the documents.

You will see that I have passed on your comments to Mark Taylor and if Mark 
Agrees, I shall try to get inserted (1) an "whole agreement" clause plus (2) 
the arbitration method wehich you have suggested.  May be Mark could just let 
me know on this score if he agrees.

Kind regards

Martin Rosell
04/23/99 11:10 AM
With reference to your fax of 21 April, 1999 as to the enforceability of 
certain agreements under Swedish law, please receive the following comments:

The relevant agreements are actionable in accordance with their respective 
terms.  Please note, however, that the availibilty in Swedish courts of 
equitable remedies such as injuction and specific performance is restricted 
under Swedish law.  The general remedy in the case of breach of contract is 
damages.

Generally speaking, a Swedish judge would not be inclined to consider matters 
of fairness or reasonability in respect of a Swedish law contract between 
commercial parties such as ECT and OM.  In the case of ambiguity, the court 
would try to establish the intention of the parties using different means of 
contract construction.  If ECT wishes to ascertain strict reliance on the 
contract terms and framework, any court discretion could be limited further 
by way of imposing an 'entire contract clause'. 

Om's disclaimers for liability are fairly aggressive, but I assume that this 
is not uncommon in these type supply & services agreements.  I cannot judge 
to what extent ECT risks incurring any liability towards OM.

The relevant Arbitration Act should be referred to as "(1929:145)".  More 
importantly, this Act  (enacted in 1929) is expected to be replaced by new 
legislation for ad hoc arbitration.  I believe that a bill for the purpose 
has been released by the Government.  I'm not yet acquainted with the 
contents of the bill, but even if I dare say that the new arbitration 
provisions are likely to be moderns and OK you may wish, rather sailing into 
unknown waters, to propose to OM arbitration in accordance with the Rules of 
the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.  I have no 
personal experience of this institute but ECT has done some due diligence on 
it (please see Vinge's response to the attached questionnaire), we refer to 
it in our physical Swedish contracts and it has a solid reputation in the 
world of international arbitration.  Below follows its own recommended 
arbitration clause: 

"Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with [this 
contract], or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled 
by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration Institute of the 
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of ........................... 
arbitrators/a sole arbitrator.

The place of the arbitration shall be ....................................

The language(s) to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be 
..................................."

If this is the preferred solution, this clause should be reflected in all 
agreements (and I doubt that OM would reject to it).

Please check the address details of OM Gruppen AB (I believe the details may 
have changed to 'Norrlandsgatan 31
105 78 Stockholm'.).

I was not expecting a letter from Crawford Bayley but I have dealt with them

Dear Mark,
I received a registered letter yesterday addressed to you at our Singapore 
office. It is from Crawford Bayley & Co. Solicitors & Advocates in Mumbai, 
India. Are you expecting a letter from them by any chance?
Actually yesterday I called another Mark Taylor in London and left a message 
on his voicemail but till now, I haven't got a reply. From what I understand, 
there are  2 Mark Taylors in Enron, so I'm not sure which one this letter 
belongs to.
Kindly advise if you are the one and if you want it forwarded to you by 
courier or mail. Pls provide your RC a/c as well.

Thank you,
Dorice.

Dorice,

Please fax the bill to me at 713-646-3490 and just put the original in the 
regular interoffice mail.

My RC is 1157

Thanks for your help.

Dear Mark,
Just received confirmation that the other Mark Taylor from London has left 
Enron. Hence the letter must be for you. As per your instruction, I opened 
the said letter and found that it's a bill from them - Crawford Bayley & Co - 
asking for payment (re: derivative).
Kindly advise if you want me to fax the letter to you or if you prefer it to 
be mailed / couriered over. Appreciate if you could furnish me with your fax 
and RC numbers as well.

Thanks,
Dorice.

Hey Marc - I was in New Orleans last week, NYC & DC the week before.  Now 
back home & ready to relax a bit.  Hope you guys came through the storm ok 
this morning.  Our cars are stuck in the garage because the alley is filled 
with downed tree branches.  I'm not even sure who to call to get it cleared 
out.  Ted got a ride from a friend and I took a cab.  Let's get together soon!

Mark

No trouble in N.O.  I was there for a conference with all 300 Enron lawyers & 
paralegals from all around the world - it didn't seem prudent to go looking 
for trouble with all those Company folks wandering around the Quarter!  I 
just came on home Friday evening & went to bed.

T. said you looked like you were having fun Friday night but didn't stay out 
late enough to find out how much fun.....

I am the lawyer in ECT legal responsible for our relationship with the NYMEX

tells me you may be able to help him in preparing the reports of our 
positions with the option delta factored in.  Thanks very much for your 
assistance.

Wow - that is one nasty looking storm out there - I wish I'd gotten in early 
enough to get a covered parking spot.  Oh well, may sufficient hail storm 
damage will get me a new car!

How would you like to deal with the Astros ticets?  I have a couple of 
meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today - maybe lunch time or when 
you're ready to leave for the day?  Just let me know.  Call if you want - 
713-853-7459.

Mark

I know you are getting the legal bills paid through Don's budget for work 
done in Argentina.  Is it possible to handle the bills for work done in 
Brazil the same way?  I have a bill from Tozzini that we need to pay.  Since 
it is all in connection with South American trading it seems reasonable to 
treat it the same as the others but I'm not sure how you are handling these 
things.  Any thoughts?

Mark:

I am concerned about committing to the development of legal risk books using 
a VAR-like analysis since our attempts in this direction a couple of years 
ago failed (Bob Williams and I worked on that project).  Many of the risks 
that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so 
near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were 
close to meaningless.

If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading 
contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than 
one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii) 
the widespread use of multiple "Omnibus" short-form contracts for trades 
before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where 
netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).  Item (i) could be fixed 
with legislation (as it has in New York).  Item (ii) could be reduced if the 
traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign 
master agreements.

I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side 
in the contract negotiation/formation process.  That buy-in needs to be at 
all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from 
the top.

Mark T.

I will probably go straight to the game from here so won't leave til 6:30 or 
7:00.  Why don't you give me a call this afternoon - say around 3:00 or 3:30 
& we can get together.

ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS INTRODUCES ON-LINE
 TRADING OF BANDWIDTH DERIVATIVES BUSINESS
 EDITORS/TECHNOLOGY WRITERS SAN
 DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MAY 11, 1999--ARBINET
 COMMUNICATIONS, INC., THE WORLD'S 
 [Business Wire ? Rcvd: May 11, 08:08 AM EDT ] 

BW0167 MAY 11,1999 5:09 PACIFIC 8:09 EASTERN 

( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line 
Trading of Bandwidth
Derivatives 

Business Editors/Technology Writers 

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 1999--Arbinet Communications, Inc., the 
world's leading trading network for
telecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and 
options in telecommunications bandwidth later this
month. 

Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's 
access-controlled website where buyers and sellers
can post prices anonymously. Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening 
process for credit, documentation and
interoperability issues. The announcement was made at the TRA Conference, 
Booth No. 1004. 

As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled 
derivative product that will allow anonymous
web-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs. 
Implementation of this product is an extension of
Arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global 
Clearing Network(TM) (AGCN(TM)). 

Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct 
advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure
to future moves in the price of capacity. Furthermore, it provides a level 
playing field where even small operators can realize the
pricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large 
incumbent telecommunications carriers. Buyers and sellers
can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future. 

Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as 
submarine cable operators. Buyers can be natural
consumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange 
Carriers) or speculators. 

"Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the 
bandwidth market," said U. Kanad Chakrabarti,
vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet. "As a non-proprietary player, 
we can offer impartial execution for our clients,
which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this." 

All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site, 
www.ebandwidth.net, beginning May 21, 1999.
The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission 
capacity. The option contract allows buyers and sellers
to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but 
currently not fully priced by telecommunications players. 

"We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading 
company," said Alex Mashinsky, chairman and
founder, Arbinet. "Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which 
gives us complete objectivity in trade execution. 

"This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom 
minutes on behalf of international and multinational
telecommunications carriers." 

For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-1200 or via 
e-mail at kchakrabarti@arbinet.com. 

Arbinet (www.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange 
and switch-based clearing network for global
telecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for 
international carriers in 1998, which it estimates
represented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year. 
The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presently
clearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies 
including Internet Telephony Service Providers and
major carriers. Founded in 1994, the company has 52 employees and is 
headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo,
Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong. AGCN was recently awarded Internet Telephony 
magazine's prestigious Editor's Choice Award
for 1999.

proposed changes should show up marked when you open it.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

Suzanne:

Please send an e-mail to all of the lawyers and paralegals in the ECT Legal 
Dept. asking them to reserve the conference dates and asking them to let you 
know their t-shirt sizes.   Once you have everyone's t-shirt sizes, please 
give the list to Dan.

Thanks,

I think we are doing Hawaiian shirts - we just don't want everyone to know 
yet.  Yes - please include all the offices - also include Singapore & Buenos

coming.

Mark -

I think you are right - this is no doubt the best we can do.  Let's go ahead 
and take care of execution.

Thanks very much for all your help.

Mark

Let me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us.  The 
guys in London never think about lining up a signatory in Houston ahead of 
time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why 
they're signing it.

Any chance you'll be in NY Monday night?  I'm taking a few people to dinner & 
you might enjoy it.

We received all outstanding documentation overnight from Houston. The Enron 
amendments to the financing will become effective today. This then clears the 
way for the banks to syndicate which will happen on Monday morning at a 
signing at A&O.

It only remains for ETOL (David or Treasa) to sign the syndication agreement 
which will be couriered here today for that purpose.

This will mean there will be nothing outstanding for any Enron entity to sign 
on Monday. It may however be politic to have an Enron presence at the signing 
on Monday to meet the banks. I will leave Gonzalo to coordinate that with Nat 
West. 

Thank you to everyone in Houston who scuttled around getting documents signed 
for us. Your efforts are appreciated.

       Mark

 

What documents do we use for these deals?  Is it the German translation of 
our Industrial Master?

   

We are looking at a new Rheinschiene (Gas Oil + Fuel Oil) Swap with BEB, a 
German gas company. The key details are:

BEB are jointly owned by Esso & Shell
Plain vanilla swap
Enron pays floating
Term of 1 -3 years
Value between DEM 250,000 - DEM 10,000,000

I will keep you posted of new developments.

Mark - the following issues pertain to the Enron Online Internet trading 
project, of which I am now a part.   In addition to having me forward this 
quick initial list of issues to Clifford Chance to look at from the European 
perspective,  Louise Kitchen suggested that Sullivan & Cromwell may also want 
to look at these issues from the US perspective for next Monday when she will 
be in New York.  Could you please advise ? Going forward, if there are other 
US legal issues facing the project, which clearly there will be, would you 
like me to co-ordinate them through you first, as with this request?    Thank 
you for your help.

As Louise mentioned briefly in today's meeting, we need to obtain a view on 
the legal implications of  "linking" web pages and the news and information 
they contain.  Some specific issues we will need a perspective on include:

1) Legal issues associated with providing hypertext links to:
 -  3rd party websites (avoiding unauthorized links such as in the Shetland 
Times case in the UK). These sites may include other
    interesting energy sites
 -  links to news items (external URL sites), etc.. Is mutual consent enough? 
What are the liability issues? 

2) The flipside: Potentially allowing linking of our Enron Online site onto 
websites of third parties, (e.g. in the form of click of simple hyperlinks or 
through  "banner ads" which would take users from the external site,  such as 
an FT.com, and bring them to our site as a marketing tool).    

*3) Issue of Publishing/Re-distributing/Re-purposing news or other business 
information from other sources
    (e.g. E-Trade shows Reuters news - what sort of legal agreement are they 
likely to have in place on a global basis?)
    (e.g. Coral Energy - have an up-to-the-minute energy news presence with 
all stories footnoted as "copyright 1999 by FWN" - presumably another 
external news agency). 

Most of the above relates to our plans for a "News Viewer" and "Links Page" 
which would encompass both :
i) publishing Enron commodity-related news to external (and internal) users.
ii) displaying/re-distributing commodity news provided by an external agency 
(e.g. Reuters, etc.) to external and internal users.

How do we satisfy the copyright requirements of others (i), and ensure we get 
full copyright protection for our own news (ii) given that all of the above 
will likely be viewable globally  ?

4)  As discussed today, providing multiple hypertext links to GTCs .  
Although it would be far more preferable to automatically personalize the 
site such that only legal information relevant to that customer is seen, as a 
fall back option, would there be any issues showing the multiple links (i.e. 
would users know which GTCs applied to them if bombarded with various 
options).

Janice:

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you - Elizabeth is now working in the 
power trading area and Sara has been out of town.

I agree with you that the letter seems harmless enough and I wouldn't blame 
the commercial folks for being upset if it looks like GS is trying to do and 
end-around on the process.  Yes - let's send it and get an opportunity to 
participate in offering the products.

I've been asked by the EI team whether they can send this letter (all the way 
at the bottom of these notes) to the client this week.  In order to get this 
out by Friday morning in Guam, it has to be done on Thursday close of 
business Houston time.   Is there any chance that we could accomplish this?  
Please advise.
Janice Moore

A year ago, we looked at a proposal from Guam asking for help w/ price risk 
management on their fuel oil purchases.  We concluded then that Guam was 
really looking for an advisor, so we declined to participate in their 
tender.  Goldman, Sachs apparently won that bid.  Now, however, it looks like 
they're interested in the products we have to offer, so the EI people would 
like to send the attached letter (all the way at the bottom of these notes) 
to be sure Enron is invited to the table.  The draft letter seems harmless 
enough, but I thought that the person in your group who will be supporting 
this effort might like to review it before it's sent.  The letter is set up 
for Kevin Beasley's signature, but the ECT organization has changed since 
then, so I can look into who that would be at this point.

I would appreciate it if you could copy me on your responses to the EI folks, 
so I can keep up w/ them. Thanks for your help.

Manuel,
       
I have forwarded this to Janice since it involves ECT.  She will review and 
talk to trading.  Let's hold off until she responds.

David

Team:

Please review and finalize the attached draft to GEDA.  I spoke with Lisa 
Taitano of GEDA today and she indicated that GEDA or GPA may bid out a 
financial risk management contract around next month.  However, Goldman 
Sachs, who is currently the risk manager, also appears to be manipulating the 
process such that it would transition from a risk manager to the provider of 
the financial products--which would explain the third paragraph in the 
attached draft.

Goldman Sachs is saying that they would forfeit the fees associated
with their role as a risk manager in exchange for negotiating the financial 
risk management contract.

Best regards,
Manuel

you lately.  Don't forget to send me a bill  for the work you did on the boat 
last month......

Thanks Justin - I was planning to come over some time shortly after the first

ISDA meeting in January that he wants me to attend so I'll probably try to 
schedule something around then.  I believe that's around the 28th.  Let's try 
to set up dinner again!

   

Hi Mark,

The document we use is an adaption of the Enron Master Swap Contract, but 
tailored for a single one-off swap deal.

When are you over next?

Hope to see you shortly!

Does the proposed reorg now contemplate that a US entity will act as 
principal for financial transactions?

Paul Simons
05/25/99 05:07 AM
The FSA (Financial Services Authority) recently published for the first time 
details of the exemptions from regulation which will be available under the 
legislation replacing the current Financial Services Act 1986 (the "Act"). 

As you know, ECTRIC is currently an unregulated booking company for our 
European financial trading business. As such, ECTRIC is not required to 
maintain what would otherwise be significant regulatory capital and is not 
subject to conduct of business rules. ECTRIC's status as an unregulated 
entity rests on exemptions which available under the Act. It is clearly 
important that equivalent exemptions are available to ECTRIC (and to the new 
US booking entity under the proposed reorg) under the replacement 
legislation.

From an initial view, the existing exemptions we rely upon will be available 
under the new regime.  However, the "devil's in the detail" and so I am 
working through the exemptions in detail with Slaughter and May.

Please give me a call on x6566 if you would like to discuss this area.

Paul

Christian,

I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the 
Armada.  The "Spanish Armada" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of 
Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth 
I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had 
something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.  The Armada 
was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around the 
English Channel.  Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.  Of course, the 
English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and 
you'd have to say "on" in the early 1800's  when Nelson "broke the enemy 
line" at the battle of Trafalgar.  I believe that was during a time when the 
Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I 
couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.  The 
battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.  I'm pretty sure it's 
somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't 
see it on the map either & wonder if it has a different name in Spanish.  
Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?  The English victory has 
in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 200 years earlier that it 
ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.

As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always 
referred to as the "trading policy" but is officially referred to as the 
"Risk Management Policy."  It most definitely covers Portland trading 
operations.  I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of 
years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.  Ted Murphy now has 
responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy.  I don't have a 
current version but will ask Ted for one.

Mark,  
I haven't had a chance to plunge into the book you lent  me at the conference 
because I am flailing around wildly in  as much as I can about certain 
Spanish topics before early July, including such things as, of course,   
Cervantes, a man whose mind I have come to love almost as much as 
Shakespeare's, the  Catalans,  the Spanish Civil War, the War of Spanish 
Succession, the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada.  I 
have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval 
history.  Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the 
battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?     Where the hell is Trafalgar?  
I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map.  
On the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming 
out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.   When one 
considers  what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they 
realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were 
actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking, one is 
involuntarily  caused to cast one's badly  jaundiced commercial-legal  mind 
upon  recent events of an analagous nature on board our own beloved ship,  
sailing as it has been  in the northern  commercial straits.   Has our  
mighty Armada sailed out onto the seas of deregulation, only to meet the 
......   perhaps I shall cease articulating  this line of thought and dwell 
upon the ingenuity of the Engish.   

Anyway,  I have come to a point here in Portland  where I need to go back 
into the policy context of our trading business.  I recall in Houston that  
we had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits and 
articulated responsibilities.  Do you still have close contact with those 
policies and if so, is there a discrete document that pertains to the 
Portland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of 
it?  I want to ground myself again in the fundamentals so my daily battles 
can be a little more fun.  --cgy

Cynthia:

As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent 
Congress.  I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which 
were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.   I'm not sure you are aware of the 
importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed 
revisions.  We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next 
Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the 
outcome this time around.  Are you the right person in your shop for us to 
talk to about this?  If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Mark

Regarding Louise's second paragraph, I guess I had always assumed there would 
be different governing law provisions at a minimum - and dispute resolution 
fits similarly - with parties in various jurisdictions.  Any thoughts?
Louise Kitchen

Good morning everyone,

Thankyou for responding promptly.

I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought 
we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement 
to something reflecting 'Password Application'.  

Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is 
obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have 
different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who 
clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one 
is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the 
online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on 
this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today.

For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite 
simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no 
WHEREAS is a good start.

Regards

Louise

Just a thought:  I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized 
credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if 
there are master agreements in place, the  credit provisions contained in 
them would apply to on-line trades.  The availability of the on-line system 
may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept. will 
limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed.

I have not yet had a chance to read this but thought I should pass it along 
asap.

Mark,

Look forward to your views on the comments expressed by CC, as well as their 
minor drafting changes.  I have not as yet sent this Sullivan & 
Cromwell....may be you would wish to do this as you see fit......

Further to our meeting yesterday, please find attached a copy of the
Internet Trading Access Agreement ("ITAA") and the Electronic Trading
Agreement ("ETA") marked up with my suggested changes from an English law
perspective.  As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will also
need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any
overriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyers
have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.

I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and
the ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by a
counterparty with a password must "click through" the Agreement before
commencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion.

We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, that
a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was
not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.
It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are
enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitations
of liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that by
entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty
receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a
position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once the
counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made
and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that
the counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is the
approach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing in
mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into
the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had
internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.

Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA
off line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents are
marked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have only
made changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I think
it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have the
following brief comments on the changes I have made:

1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by a
designated
 Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group
undertakings.  The reason
 for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the
counterparty and
 various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure that
such Transactions
 with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these
documents.
 I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need
to list the affiliates
 or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there may
be some confusion here.
 This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entities
which trade certain
 commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on
the Website.
 The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this
but I assume that this
 causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on
the Website depending
 on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplate
this.

2. "Services":  I have removed the references to Services as I am not
sure what this means.
 I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the
counterparty's access and
 utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out
any Transactions.  Therefore,
 I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to
Services, it can now refer to
 "access and utilization of" the Website.

3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3
of the ETA which
 provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron
generates a message of
 confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any
electronic records
 of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage a
document being attached
 which explains this.  This is also acceptable.

4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate for
relevant data protection
 wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.
This is because the
 data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. living
individuals, rather than
 corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providing
appropriate wording for
 this, could you please let me know what information will be
collected by you concerning
 living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  For
example, when a password is
 entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or
can you intentionally or
 unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or other
information on them once
 they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with your
technical people.

Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your
comments.

I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleagues
for their review.  They may have further comments which we will send onto
you as a matter of urgency.

Kind regards

Andrew Wilkinson

Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''

Justin,

I note that the ETA has been revised to include a paragraph which provides 
that Enron's electronic records will prevail over a signed confirmation.  Is 
that how we want this to work?  In the telephone trading context we assume 
that the executed confirmation will control over the oral conversation, even 
when we have a recording of the conversation.

Look forward to your views on the comments expressed by CC, as well as their 
minor drafting changes.  I have not as yet sent this Sullivan &

Further to our meeting yesterday, please find attached a copy of the
Internet Trading Access Agreement ("ITAA") and the Electronic Trading
Agreement ("ETA") marked up with my suggested changes from an English law
perspective.  As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will also
need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any
overriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyers
have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.

I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and
the ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by a
counterparty with a password must "click through" the Agreement before
commencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion.

We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, that
a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was
not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.
It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are
enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitations
of liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that by
entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty
receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a
position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once the
counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made
and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that
the counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is the
approach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing in
mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into
the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had
internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.

Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA
off line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents are
marked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have only
made changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I think
it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have the
following brief comments on the changes I have made:

1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by a
designated
 Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group
undertakings.  The reason
 for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the
counterparty and
 various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure that
such Transactions
 with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these
documents.
 I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need
to list the affiliates
 or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there may
be some confusion here.
 This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entities
which trade certain
 commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on
the Website.
 The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this
but I assume that this
 causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on
the Website depending
 on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplate
this.

2. "Services":  I have removed the references to Services as I am not
sure what this means.
 I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the
counterparty's access and
 utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out
any Transactions.  Therefore,
 I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to
Services, it can now refer to
 "access and utilization of" the Website.

3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3
of the ETA which
 provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron
generates a message of
 confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any
electronic records
 of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage a
document being attached
 which explains this.  This is also acceptable.

4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate for
relevant data protection
 wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.
This is because the
 data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. living
individuals, rather than
 corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providing
appropriate wording for
 this, could you please let me know what information will be
collected by you concerning
 living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  For
example, when a password is
 entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or
can you intentionally or
 unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or other
information on them once
 they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with your
technical people.

Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your

Sorry - I'll be in NYC that weekend and I believe that's T's big swim meet in 
Atlanta.  But thanks for the offer!

I'm not sure whether to feel sorry for you or not - can't wait to hear the 
details  Yes, it was a fun weekend - we were in Austin.  T. swimming at the 
Lake and I stayed around the hotel using the gym and getting a massage.  Good 
food, too.  The only downer was the drive.  

Darlene:

I'm busy on Thursday but Friday looks good.

Our meeting for this morning will have to be canceled due to scheduling 
conflicts.  Please make every effort to reserve this time slot (first and 
third Wednesdays at 10:00) in the future for our group meetings.

Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms 
- including the Omnibus Annex A.  Please give some thought to whether there 
are any other revisions we should make at this time.  We make every effort to 
minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been 
changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many 
necessary changes made at this time as possible.

I currently have a 28800 modem but would like to get the fastest (within 
reason) modem we have available for a Compaq LTE 5280.  Please let me know if 
this is the kind of thing I can get by Friday since I leave for London Friday 
afternoon and would like to take the computer (complete with modem) with me.  
If the new modem is not available in that time frame, I at least need a new 
pigtail for the existing card since the old one is broken.

Thanks and please charge 413/1157.

Mark,

Look forward to your views on the comments expressed by CC, as well as their 
minor drafting changes.  I have not as yet sent this Sullivan & 
Cromwell....may be you would wish to do this as you see fit......

Look forward to seeing you soon in a week or so...

Further to our meeting yesterday, please find attached a copy of the
Internet Trading Access Agreement ("ITAA") and the Electronic Trading
Agreement ("ETA") marked up with my suggested changes from an English law
perspective.  As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will also
need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any
overriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyers
have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.

I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and
the ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by a
counterparty with a password must "click through" the Agreement before
commencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion.

We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, that
a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was
not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.
It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are
enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitations
of liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that by
entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty
receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a
position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once the
counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made
and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that
the counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is the
approach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing in
mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into
the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had
internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.

Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA
off line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents are
marked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have only
made changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I think
it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have the
following brief comments on the changes I have made:

1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by a
designated
 Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group
undertakings.  The reason
 for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the
counterparty and
 various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure that
such Transactions
 with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these
documents.
 I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need
to list the affiliates
 or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there may
be some confusion here.
 This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entities
which trade certain
 commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on
the Website.
 The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this
but I assume that this
 causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on
the Website depending
 on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplate
this.

2. "Services":  I have removed the references to Services as I am not
sure what this means.
 I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the
counterparty's access and
 utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out
any Transactions.  Therefore,
 I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to
Services, it can now refer to
 "access and utilization of" the Website.

3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3
of the ETA which
 provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron
generates a message of
 confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any
electronic records
 of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage a
document being attached
 which explains this.  This is also acceptable.

4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate for
relevant data protection
 wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.
This is because the
 data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. living
individuals, rather than
 corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providing
appropriate wording for
 this, could you please let me know what information will be
collected by you concerning
 living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  For
example, when a password is
 entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or
can you intentionally or
 unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or other
information on them once
 they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with your
technical people.

Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your
comments.

I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleagues
for their review.  They may have further comments which we will send onto
you as a matter of urgency.

Kind regards

Hey Tim -  

Thanks for the note - I needed a smile today.  I've been extremely busy and 
am leaving this afternoon for another trip to our London office.  Were you 
able to make any headway with the Bank regarding the NY house?  I just 
wondered if Greg had been able to help at all.

Mark

One more try......

Hi Marc - 

I just got back from London last night.  Looks like our IT people found out 
about this yesterday too - don't know if it hit us or not but they made 
everybody log off & back on again during the day yesterday - I'm assuming 
that was to install a new virus shield.  Didn't affect me since I wasn't here 
anyway. 

 How've you been?

Does this make sense to you?

We're home this weekend - might go sailing (you're welcome to come if you 
want) but nothing big planned.  I'm in NYC next Wed - Sun., T's in a swim 
meet in Atlanta next weekend, NYC after that.  Nothing planned for the 26/27 
weekend & still toying with the idea of Seattle for the 4th.

Here's a very rough draft of a set of slides we might use.  Let me know if 
this is even close to what you have in mind.  I can have one of our 
paralegals and our graphics dept. fill in whatever we need and make it look 
good tomorrow.

Attached is the form of schedule to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement we use for 
purely financial transactions - swaps and options.  There are a large number 
of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever 
an Enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with 
local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and 
negotiating from here.  To the extent you are interested in using ISDA Master 
Agreements, we will be happy to continue in the same way.  I'm not sure they 
will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements I 
suspect you need.  If you need the printed form of the ISDA Master that the 
schedule relates to, let me know and I can have it faxed to you.

When the transaction is physical, even if there is an embedded swap or option 
of some kind, we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from 
commodity to commodity.  I will ask Elizabeth Sager to send you some sample 
electricity forms and Jeff Hodge or Dan Hyvl to send some natural gas forms.  
In a trading context, since Enron may be on either side of one or more 
transactions with the same counterparty, the forms are drafted in a bilateral 
fashion (basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give).  If your 
situation is different (e.g. our transactions with one party involve only the 
purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity, dramatic 
changes to these forms might be in order.

With regard to loan/finance transactions, I am not at all familiar with forms 
they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent 
that they don't even use forms as such.  I will ask Julia Murray to contact 
you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk 
about those types of transactions.  Unfortunately, I don't know of an 
electronic table of contents to the forms.  There is a project underway to 
create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought.

   

When we met in Buenos Aires a couple of months ago, you mentioned that you 
might
be able to provide Robert George and I with some ECT forms that would help us
with our deals in the Southern Cone. Of course these forms would be used as a
guideline and would be adapted as needed to comply with local laws. We would 
be
interested in any electronic copies of any ECT forms where (i) Enron is a 
party
to either side of a physical or financial swap (fuel and/or electric), (ii)
Enron is a party to fuel or electricity supply agreements (interruptible or
firm), (iii) Enron is a party to loan/finance documents, and (iv) Enron is a
party to construction /O&M Agreements.  Equally useful might be an electronic
table of contents to the ECT form books that  Brent mentioned having when I 
was
last in BA.  Thanks much.

I don't remember if I talked to you about this last month or not.  If not, 
would you mind giving Brent a hand with his broker agreement?  
I am working on preparing a new form of Broker Agreement for Don.  Is there a 
form that ECT has used in the past?  The version we will be drafting will 
have certain non-traditional obligations on the broker such as the obligation 
to find a seller for the buyer's consumption requirements, guarantee to 
seller the buyers payment obligations and so forth.  Do you think Vicky may 
have prepared broker agreements for EES?  If my description is too vague call
me and I can describe it in more detail.  Thanks.

Kevin & I are putting the final touches on our presentation - will we be able 
to have a projector for a computer/powerpoint presentation?

Mark

Yes, we would like to use the PowerPoint presentation.  Sorry for the last 
minute request.  If it's a big problem, I might be able to get our graphics 
dept. to turn it into 35mm slides.

   

Dear Mark,

Kevin had indicated that he would like to use an overhead projector but if
you would like to have a LCD panel for a PowerPoint Presentation, just let
me know so I can make quick arrangements.

Thanks.

I think this has already been sent to you.  Just wondering, though, why this

Maria,  Please follow this message with the attached file to Gareth.  For 
some reason I cannot get it to go to Gareth directly.

Gareth,

Attached is the current draft of the swap confirmation for the Petrobras 
transaction.  The swap has two components -- the fixed/Libor rate swap and 
the "spread" swap.  The fixed/Libor swap is composed of the amounts computed 
pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (i) of 
the definition of floating amount.  The amounts computed pursuant to clauses 
(iv) and (v) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (ii) of the 
definition of floating amount is the spread swap.
This is going to be a very unusual and highly structured swap in many 
respects in order to tailor it to the risk sharing that exists in this 
transaction among Petrobras, the Lenders, and Enron as swap provider. Because 
the swap includes both the rate swap and the spread swap, the benefits and 
obligations under the swap will need to be allocated internally at Enron 
between EI and ECT.  Randy and Scott recommend that a memorandum be generated 
that will reflect the manner in which this allocation will be made.  
Essentially as it is explained to me, ECT will be allocated the benefits and 
obligations related to the fixed/Libor swap and EI will be allocated the 
benefits and obligations related to the spread swap.
One other feature that EI will be responsible for is the Deferral Amount 
mentioned in the confirmation.  This arises if a Reserve Deficiency occurs 
and the Reserve Indemnity is no longer in effect.  In this situation, if any 
amount is owed to ECT on the rate swap the Company will not have sufficient 
cash flow to pay the full amount due to ECT and the Lenders.  The Lenders 
will be deferring a prorata part of their interest and principal, and ECT as 
swap provider will also have to defer a prorata part of the amount due to 
it.  The amount to be deferred is called the Deferral Amount in the attached 
draft.  EI will be responsible for any Deferral Amounts that may arise.  If 
after a Deferral Amount is generated, the Company is able to recoup any of 
the Deferral Amount, the portion payable to the Swap Provider under the 
Participation Agreement would be a "Makeup Amount" and would be allocated to 
EI when received under the swap.
A great deal of additional thought and fine tuning will continue to need to 
be applied to this portion of the transaction to make sure that it 
coordinates as appropriate with the Credit Agreement, Participation Agreement 
and Transaction Documents.  Any suggestions that you or the ECT swap lawyers 
may have would be appreciated.  One thing that would be useful would be a 
"breakage clause" that would describe in as much specificity as posible how 
the breakage would be computed whenever it is necessary to adjust the 
notional amounts under the fixed/libor swap.

I have been unable to reach either Jeff Keeler or Maureen McVicker to talk 
about this today.  I'm a little worried about who is handling the 
Commissioner's itinerary at this point and I don't know if anyone has 
reserved a conference room for the 2:30 meeting.  Fred Lagrasta is now also 
supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make (I don't know 
if he needs any audio/visual equipment).  Can you check on this - maybe 
somebody else in Jeff Keeler's, Steve Kean's, or maybe even Ken Rice's office 
will know where this is supposed to take place?  It is entirely possible that 
no one has reserved a room yet.  If you could do that and then let the 
attendees know where it will be, I'd appreciate it.  Unfortunately, I'm on my 
way out to the airport now and can't take care of this myself.

Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments, 
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge 
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets, 
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it 
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible 
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA 
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets 
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not 
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing 
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this 
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that 
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional 
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing 
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original 
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary 
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized 
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other 
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an 
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these 
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a 
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, 
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade 
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately 
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, 
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be 
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be 
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such 
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert 
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its 
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge 
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets 
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would 
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :

The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities 
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :

I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above 
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into. 
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am 
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information 
please call me.

Please review the attached description.  Per my voicemail I would like to 
have it posted on the Texas Lawyer website.  This is a free site for 
employers.  Please send me back any changes or comments.  

I can certainly be available for a portion of that time - can you tell me the

Hi Debbie:

Thanks for your note - it's always nice to hear from MC friends!  

I'm living in Houston and working in the legal department of a large energy 
company (Enron).  I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, 
options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce 
which is relatively new.  The most fun work project I've had was being the 
lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading 
platform about a year ago.  It has been tremendously successful.  While few 
people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in 
the world!

I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international 
mutual funds in New York.  My work takes me there several times a year and I 
usually try to see him if I have some free time.  The college is thinking 
about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning 
committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).  Ralph V. was there - whom I 
hadn't seen in years! - and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.  I was 
on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.  There were only 2 of us 
from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see 
familiar faculty faces.  With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.

My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a 
terrible commute.  I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.  I 
rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me 
know if you ever make it down this way.

Mark

Sure - it's not secret.

I thought I'd send this around just as a reminder of the RMT guidelines.  As 
far as I know these have not changed since Rhett's memo last year.
	Rhett Jackson
	11/01/1999 10:08 AM
		 
Attached please find the most recent guidelines for confirming swap 
transactions with RMT.  Please distribute this memorandum to others involved 
in the confirmation process, as appropriate, and feel free to call me at 
X34718 if you have any questions or comments.

Regards.
Rhett Jackson

Generally speaking we have only documented that kind of concern when there 
were separate legal entities involved (like getting a comfort letter or 
guaranty from EI when ECT had to do the swap for one of their deals).  I 
think we can get away with pointing out the issue to both commercial sides.

	Mary Cook
	12/14/2000 03:30 PM
		 
The VPP swap vehicle is being structured such that if a major adverse 
reservoir event occurs (no gas!) and as a result the Partnership (owned by 
Trust/banks) cannot fund the swap payments, then as swap default occurs and 
if termination payment is owed to ENA, the termination payment will in 
essence be subordinated to the bank loan repayment.  This is clearly a free 
walk on ENA on the swap (ENA in essence wears reservoir risk on the swap).  
If this is the commercial deal, so be it.  However, I am concerned that the 
"$ fallout" in such event be charged internally to the finance originators 
and not the trading arm, but I do not know who to talk to about this.  Any 
ideas?  Or should I assume it resolves itself internally as and when it may 
occur?  
Mary

Cordially,
Mary Cook

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I have now reviewed this matter with Rob 
Milnthorp.  The status of Bank of Nova Scotia's financing arrangements to our 
counterparty Beau Canada Exploration Ltd., which was recently purchased by 
Murphy Oil  Canada Ltd., remains unclear.  However, until such time as that 
has been clarified, including the Bank of Nova Scotia's consent to our 
security for our mark-to-market positions with Beau Canada (now Murphy Oil 
Canada), Bank of Nova Scotia should not, at the request of Enron Canada, be

Justin, Enron Canada is currently in an unresolved dispute with Bank of Nova 
Scotia where from our perspective Bank of Nova Scotia has essentially been 
telling us to shove off.  The dispute involves BNS's purported requirement to 
consent to collateral security given to Enron Canada for physical and 
financial trading positions with a counterparty known as Beau Canada.  
Neither Bank of Nova Scotia nor any affiliate of Bank of Nova Scotia should

I have spoken with Susan Ruggles at Goldman Sachs (guarantor for J. Aron) a 
couple of times and she informed me that the Assignment Agreement is being 
reviewed by legal.  The attorney is Steve Bunkin, whom I have also left a 
message.  The assignment has been executed by Statoil and Enron, and was sent 
to Goldman Sachs on October 2.  I will continue to contact them, or, if you 
would like to call, Steve's number is 212-902-0952, email is 
steven.bunkin@gs.com.

Gentlemen:

In connection with an analysis of the tax issues presented by the E-commerce 
program, it is important that all Enron entities to participate in such 
system (as well the products to be traded by such entities) be compiled.  
London has undertaken this with respect to Europe (and, shortly, Singapore).  
I have undertaken to coordinate this with respect to North America.  Thus, if 
you could send me a list of North American Enron entities to be incorporated 
in the E-commerce program (and the products they will trade) I can then 
undertake to determine what issues such presents.  In this regard, I will 
coordinate with ECT-Legal in North America to verify that the manner such 
entities are to be incorporated into the E-commerce program does not trigger 
unplanned for tax consequences.

In addition, it would be helpful to obtain copies of the form of agreements 
to be entered into by counterparties prior to such parties being granted 
access to the E-commerce system (i.e., the form of on-line access agreements 
and any agreements ancilliary thereto).  These agreements are important to 
the tax analysis of the E-commerce program because the manner such agreements 
are to be entered into may implicate tax nexus concerns that we will want to 
work to mitigate (for example, if it is contemplated that all such on-line 
agreements are to be administratively executed by a single entity 
("Administrative Entity") on behalf of each Enron trading entity 
participating in the E-commerce system, such process could expose the Enron 
trading entity to tax exposure in the jurisdiction in which the 
Administrative Entity is located - obviously, this may be more complicated if 
it is uncertain where such Administrative Entity is located).

Finally, it is understood that the manner in which trading is to be effected 
through the E-commerce system is such that the Enron trading entity 
established as the entity to trade with a particular counterparty will be the 
only such Enron entity transacting business with such counterparty.  In this 
regard, therefore, it is not contemplated that one Enron trading entity will 
transact in part with a counterparty and that another Enron trading entity 
will complete such trade (for example, it will not be possible for a 
counterparty to obtain an agreement with respect to a particular product with 
EEL that will then be supplied by ECT - though this may occur on occasion in 
a fashion no different that is currently the case).  Please notify me in the 
event that this understanding is not correct so that we can plan to mitigate 
the potential tax issues that will be raised if trading is to occur otherwise 
(in this regard, as was discussed on Tuesday with Dave Mally and David Port, 
if a trade is transacted in a manner whereby one Enron entity executes a 
transaction and fulfills the requirements of such by purchasing inventory 
from another Enron entity, the income derived in such transaction is 
potentially subject to taxation in multiple tax jurisdictions).

Please contact either myself at x30938 or, if I am unavailable, Jeff 
Blumenthal at x35777 in Houston with any follow-up questions.  Best regards.

Thanks - I've asked Sara to give him a call now, too.

Hope you had a good holiday - all too short unfortunately !

Many apologies but I seem to have mislaid the piece of paper with the name of 
the person that I need to contact to get a copy of the standard ENA legal 
opinion.  I would be grateful if you could give me their details again.

Many tks and all the best for the New Year,

Denis

Melba, I am waiting to confirm one outstanding issue before signing off on

from a legal perspective.  I will send you an e-mail as soon as the issue is 
resolved.  Mark, I think that, other than the particular market issues that 
arose at the end of the year, you and I had otherwise agreed on the language 
and were ready to go.  Am I right?

Cheers

Why don't you come in Saturday night & I'll take you to dinner?

I did get Janet the white top (Interlock turtleneck - Medium, color - white 
#A32027)  from Talbots.  It was the fleece vest that they didn't have in the 
stores.  I did not get the towels.

Glad the computer is working better for you.  It makes all the difference in 
the world to have it speed up.  For me it actually becomes more useful since 
I cant stand just sitting there staring at it waiting for something to 
happen.  

My paperwhites haven't bloomed yet - I do remember from the last time I grew 
some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering.  I wonder if people grow 
them outdoors when the weather warms up.  The smell might work better with 
more room to disperse.  This time I have six coming up all at once - I hope I 
can stand it!

Love,

Mark

I think the answers will be the same for Stockholm - i.e. as long as we are 
not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading 
advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange 
Act issues.

I will be happy to let you know as often as you need the percentage of my

Hi Mark --

Attached is Oracle's standard NDA.  We can work with it if you like it or use 
our own.

The Oracle folks are dropping by Enron here in Houston on Friday of this week 
(the 5th).  If we are able to put an NDA in place by then, we will go into 
more detail with Oracle at the meeting.  If we do not have a new NDA in 
place, we will keep the meeting high level.  Thanks for your help.  Best 
regards.

relocating the TV, please let me know. Also, what is the cost for
 removing the TV?
 Charge CO/RC = 0413/105658

(2) We need to have the secretarial cube at EB3875 lowered to 42".  I guess 
this is a request for construction????
 Charge CO/RC = 0413/105659

(3) The copier has been delivered by my desk at EB3855A from 3AC.  Can we get 
a status on the engineers getting the plug ready?
 ( you know what I mean).

(4) We also need to get a drawing for reconstructing the area between my desk 
at EB3855A and EB3858/EB3858A/EB3858C/EB3858B.  We need to   maximize this 
space and add to secretarial workstations and maybe some type of closure to 
block the sound of the copier.

(5) We need to relocate the library currently at EB3858C to the team room at 
EB3872.

(6) Can I please get a current copy of the floor plan.

(7) The Cost Memo has been signed for the final phase of construction by Mark 
Haedicke.  Can I get the estimated date for construction to begin?
  I need to put in a churn request as soon as possible.

Today, Raul w/ McCoy came by and we did a walk through for the offices that 
were just completed.

I would like to take off Friday, Jan. 12 and 1/2 day Thurs., Jan. 11 as we 
have an out of town guest coming on Thurs. afternoon.  Please let me know if 
this will be a problem.

Thanks,

Rumor has it that Jim Newsome will be named Interim Chairman of the CFTC 
today or tomorrow.  No word yet on who will be the Bush selection for CFTC 
Chair, but Newsome wants to stay and has friends in high places.  More to 
follow.

I think this will do for now.  Thanks

I would think adding the name would be adequate; do you agree?

	
	                           
	

Pertaining to the email below--I spoke to El Paso this morning about the 
gty's (there are a total of 3 in question covering financial and physical 
deals w/ENA, HPL, and EPMI).  They agreed to have those three amended to 
include the name El Paso Merchant Energy, LP (as they only include Gas, LP).  
This is what their Legal is recommending in order to have the gty amendments 
executed ASAP and to make it as clean as possible (since 2 of the 3 gty's are 
tied to contracts).  Also, the amendments will be made effective as of 
12/31/00.

Let me know if you think we should ask for completely new gty's.

Veronica
We have received copies of a Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware 
Secretary of State on 12/22/00, effective 12/31/00, wherein El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas, L.P. (Global Counterparty #72297), a Delaware limited 
partnership, merged with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. (Global 
Counterparty #53350), a Delaware limited partnership, with El Paso Merchant 
Energy, L.P. (Global Counterparty #53350) as the surviving corporation.

By virtue of this merger, the ISDA Master Agreement dated 12/01/99 should now 
reflect El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. as the Counterparty.  In connection 
with this merger, Credit will be getting a new parent guaranty from the 
Counterparty.  Upon its receipt, copies will be distributed.

Copies of the Certificate of Merger will be distributed.

Elizabeth Sager, who is responsible for power trading documentation in North 
America and was in large part responsible for drafting the Industrial Master 
several years ago, is reviewing the proposed form.  She will have comments 
for us by Monday morning, Houston time.

Martin Rosell
06/22/99 09:04 AM
Please find attached a copy of the above document, marked to show changes 
from the draft of S&M, together with a clean copy thereof (please disregard 
any layout or file format deficiencies).  Besides further streamlining and 
refining of the doc, I've also styled it somewhat differently why it, on the 
face of the mark-ups, may appear even more amended than is the case. 
I've chosen to call the doc. 'Nordic Power Master Agreement' and inserted the 
Norwegian name of the Nordic Power Traders Association ("NPTA") in the header 
(hopefully, NPTA will be prepared to launch and market the doc. in its own 
name).  I've also prepared a brief Schedule addressing the optionality 
offered by the document.  The document is originally based upon ECT's 
Industrial Master Agreement.  In the Industrial Agreement, terms such as "the 
Contract", "this Contract", "this Agreement" and "the Agreement" are used 
interchangeably and not always with great preciseness.  In the attached 
document the terms "this Master Agreement" or "this Agreement" are used 
consistently (the latter to include all Transactions).  These are my remarks 
to the (principal) changes made, and to some issues that the new doc gives 
rise to:

1.  Transactions.  

I've introduced some ISDA wordings herein (for example, the "Inconsistency" 
provisions) and deleted text that I find less appropriate or necessary in the 
current context.

2.  Obligations

This is a critical Section since it also refers to products for which there 
currently are no NPTA documentation ("Options" and "Collars").  When I 
discussed this with the Nordic trading desk it sounded less thrilled about us 
expanding the current Nordic bilateral power contracts range, and I have 
therefore left references to options (other than swaptions and Asian options) 
within square brackets (including related definitions).  (Supposedly, this 
will be something for the Working Group, Reference Group and the NPTA to 
determine.)  I've expanded the text on SWAPs and included a brief reference 
to ASIAN (options) and also streamlined the Tax clause. 

3.  Representation

Reps are not particularly common in Nordic law contracts.  The "No Reliance" 
reps appear to be typically American and may not be to everyone's taste.  
Since parties seldom are prepared to give "Payee" reps I've cut out that part 
and also taken out the "Payer" reps as something that we should be able to do 
without.   I also feel a bit hesitant towards S&M's proposed "Changes in 
Representation" and therefore rubbed that one out as well (whilst being at 
it).

4.  Market Disruption

Since the underlying reference price (Nord Pool's spot price) is quoted on an 
hourly basis, some wordings have been included to reflect that.

5.  Events of Default

I'm mostly concerned about the cross-default clause.  Insofar as ECTRIC (and 
its possible Credit Support Provider) is concerned, we may, in this 
particular context, lose more than we gain from a cross default provision.  
Also, the cross default  also only appears to apply to "borrowed money" (and 
"such obligation") and not default under any other "specified transactions".  
It's worth considering making cross default optional and part of the Schedule 
instead.

6.  Remedies

As the enforceability of close-out netting in certain jurisdictions may 
require the automatic termination of all Transactions, it's  necessary to 
offer the parties the choice of "Automatic Early Termination" in the Schedule.

7.  Events of Change

I've followed the route of the Nordic 'Amendment Agreement' and pulled 
together "Events of  Change" and "Change in Tax Law" and done my best to 
streamline this sections since it undoubtedly will raise questions from local 
players in due course.

(The former sections 8 (Credit Support), 9 (Set-off) and 10 (Confidentiality) 
have been edited out.  The former because of the streamlining of the credit 
provisions (and related definitions) and the two latter since those concern 
issues that rather should be addressed by the parties bilaterally.)

8.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction

As previously discussed, this part is something for the parties to agree upon 
in the Schedule.

9.  Documents

As above under 8.

10.  Miscellaneous

I've crossed out the former "Currency Provisions" since it won't be 
enforceable in certain jurisdictions.  (Might be something for the Schedule.)

11.  Definitions

Some of the credit terms have been stricken out.  With reference to my 
earlier comment with respect to the uncertainty relating to the inclusion 
into the document of further options instruments, the related terms defined 
are in between square brackets.  Some of the defined terms may need to be 
further refined to better reflect the products, trading routines and 
settlement mechanisms in the Nordic Electricity market.

Exhibit A 

The relevant details can be found in the Schedule.

Please return with any comments you may have before close of business on 
Thursday (Oslo time).

I can't believe you have to change planes in Chicago AND Dallas!  I don't 
remember you being that willing to suffer for a cheaper ticket.

Bummer - looks like I'll just have to be the wimp this time.  There's really 
no way I can get away next week.  I have heard of las ventanas - but I didn't 
know about the evian spritzing.

Maybe next time.  Any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing?  I 
could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister......

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of 
the office construction process will begin in just over a week.  That means 
it is finally time to move into your new offices.  Taffy Milligan will be 
submitting the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and will have details 
directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of 
the office construction project will begin in a little over a week.  There is 
good news and bad news.  First the bad: the office which you currently occupy 
will be in the next construction phase.    Now the good:  it looks like we 
will probably have a place for you to sit until your new office is ready.  
Taffy Milligan will submit the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and 
will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and 
arrange your move.

That's a great idea - I'll see if I can line up a boat - anywhere in 
particular you'd like to sail?  (BVI makes sense if there's a newcomer along.)

Well Charlottesville actually has its own airport (looks a bit like St 
Thomas).  But DC is the only other place close by - and then a rental car (or 
bus or train).  I have an extra room reserved at Keswick Hall - very 
expensive - and at some point I have to release it or pay for it. Check it 
out at www.Keswick.com.    Rooms are tight over graduation weekend.

Mark,

I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to 
certain 
negative pledges.  The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial 
transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES 
person is looking to 
enter into a long term EES transaction.  We sent them a draft ISDA for future 
transactions 
out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit 
Support Annex (CSA) 
is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal.  She has stated that they are 
not able 
to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their 
Credit 
support agreement.  As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot 
have any liens that
secure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 
million.  Can you 
please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a 
lien, and if this type 
collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement.  If this is a breach 
can you suggest 
other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable.

Thanks
Russell

Negative Pledge.   Neither  any Borrower nor  any  Subsidiary  of  any
Borrower  will create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any  asset
now owned or hereafter acquired by it, except:

Liens  existing on the date of this Agreement securing Debt outstanding
on  the date of this Agreement in an aggregate principal or face amount
not exceeding $135,000,000;

any  Lien  existing on any asset of any Person at the time such  Person
becomes a Subsidiary of a Borrower and not created in contemplation  of
such event;

any Lien on any asset securing Debt incurred or assumed for the purpose
of  financing  all or any part of the cost of acquiring or constructing
such asset, provided that such Lien attaches to such asset concurrently
with  or  within  90  days  after  the  acquisition  or  completion  of
construction thereof;

any Lien on any asset of any Person existing at the time such Person is
merged  or  consolidated with or into a Borrower or a Subsidiary  of  a
Borrower and not created in contemplation of such event;

any  Lien existing on any asset prior to the acquisition thereof  by  a
Borrower or a Subsidiary of a Borrower and not created in contemplation
of such acquisition;

any  Lien  arising  out  of  the  refinancing,  extension,  renewal  or
refunding  of  any Debt secured by any Lien permitted  by  any  of  the
foregoing clauses of this Section, provided that the proceeds  of  such
Debt  are  used  solely for the foregoing purpose and to pay  financing
costs and such Debt is not secured by any additional assets;

Liens  arising in the ordinary course of its business which (i) do  not
secure  Debt  or  Derivatives  Obligations,  (ii)  do  not  secure  any
obligation in an amount exceeding $100,000,000 and (iii) do not in  the
aggregate materially detract from the value of its assets or materially
impair the use thereof in the operation of its business;

Liens  on  cash and cash equivalents securing Derivatives  Obligations,
provided that the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents subject
to such Liens may at no time exceed $10,000,000; and

Liens  not otherwise permitted by the foregoing clauses of this Section
securing  Debt in an aggregate principal or face amount, together  with
all  other Debt secured by Liens permitted under this Section  5.09(i),
not  to  exceed  an  amount  equal to 10%  of  Consolidated  Net  Worth
(calculated  as  of  the last day of the fiscal quarter  most  recently
ended  on  or prior to the date of the most recent incurrence  of  such
Debt).

Seems to me that L/C's are the way to go then, rather than asking for cash or 
another asset as collateral.  (Another option would be to mix and match - 
taking cash up to $10 mil. and L/C's beyond that.)   Lenders frequently set 
up the facilities available to the borrower this way so they keep control 
over how much "debt" is supported by the asset base while still giving the 
borrower some flexibility.  As you can imagine, most other extenders of 
credit are willing to take the bank's L/C in lieu of a lien on a hard asset.

Nora - I got your voice mail & will try to call you soon - I'm stuck on a

want to make if we were on the other side.

Mark, what are your thoughts on attached from EOL perspective?  Envera's 
proposal is inconsistent with Enron legal policy on punitive, consequential, 
lost profit type damages.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks, NJD

Envera still has an issue with the indemnity offered under the Linking
Agreements.  As we discussed in our conference yesterday, Envera cannot
permit DealBench or EnronOnline to disclaim consequential damages that may
be payable to a plaintiff in a trademark infringement action.  Envera is not
seeking to recover Envera's own lost profits or consequential damages, just
those that Envera must pay to a plaintiff in an infringement action.

Envera's request is that a statement be added to the indemnity section
clarifying that any damages awarded in a final judgment or paid in
settlement of an infringement claim be deemed "direct" damages.  Dean stated
in yesterday's e-mail that DealBench, as a matter of policy, does not agree
to such requests.

After some discussion among Envera business people, Envera is uncomfortable
with the position taken by DealBench and Enron on this issue.  If DealBench
and Enron are not prepared to stand behind the trademarks that they so
vigorously protect in the Linking Agreements, then Envera is not prepared to
shoulder the risk that Envera would be required come out of pocket for a
plaintiff's lost profits.  Envera is not able to control the risk that
EnronOnline and DealBench have chosen infringing trademarks, other than by
not establishing the links at all.

If the concern of DealBench and EnronOnline is that they could be required
to pay punitive damages that arise from Envera's misuse of the trademarks,
this eventuality is already covered in the indemnity provision.  Neither
party is required to indemnify Envera for infringement claims based upon any
use of the marks not expressly authorized under the Linking Agreements.

I have attached drafts of the two Linking Agreements, marked to show the
language that Envera would like added to Section 4(c).  Please review the
proposed changes and let me know whether they are acceptable to DealBench
and EnronOnline.  If not, Envera will need to consider whether it will even
establish the links.

Jonathan

Have a good weekend and holiday!

There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated 
transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for 
telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk 
the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the 
other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated 
trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the 
internet trading language in the confirm they generate?

I just heard that there is a farewell party for Rainer on Friday afternoon - 
don't know any details.

Ohmygawd!  An e-mail message from Hal!  Now I know we really ARE in the 21st 
century.

I also get to Key West on the 24th and will be there until the 28th and don't 
need a place to stay because I will be at the conference hotel.  Ted will get 
there Friday eve.  I have meetings during the days Thursday & Friday and Sat. 
morning; dinner on Friday is also a scheduled event for me.  Otherwise I 
don't think we have specific plans.  Looking forward to it!

Sounds good to me - let's say dinner on Thursday and then either lunch or 
dinner - your choice - including Ted on Saturday.  We have no plans at all so 
far so we're flexible.

Tana has pointed out that Net Works does not have a policy (at least not one 
we have heard of) regarding the handling of original contract documentation 
after it is executed.  There is not an Enron-wide policy but instead a 
patch-work of policies created by the operating units.  Tana and I would be 
happy to discuss this with you - or whoever you want to designate - and make 
suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind.

	Greg Piper@ENRON

What we need to accomplish in the next few days:

Dave Forster and Mark Palmer will develop and finalize the demo that will be 
used for pitching the sale.  Dave and Mark will create two demos, one which 
shows how Enron uses the tools/system(s) and two, a demo on how a company 
such as Carghill would use the tools in a private application.  This will all 
then be set up so it can be shown on the road or in house to clients.  Dave 
and Mark have started this work today.

Mark Taylor will work the following two legal issues in parallel:  First, 
find outside council that will be able to help with the internal audit of all 
legal contracts associated with EOL as well as be able to assist in legal 
matters associated with the due diligence and assist in contract work 
associated with the actual sale in the future.  The legal audit must be 
prepared and completed by early next week so we can keep our planned visit 
with i2 late next week and feel comfortable that we can sell we are proposing 
to sell from a legal standpoint.

Jay will complete the technical audit and write up his conclusions (or Kevin).

Rex and Greg will continue to refine the list of potential clients and the 
appropriate contacts on the list.  Any suggestions on how to make sure we 
have the right names, etc. just send them in to Rex.

Rex will also refine the actual presentation to be used in the pitch and get 
a copy to Louise in the next day or two so she can review the content of it.

We will also need t o have a separate timeline/calendar that shows who we are 
seeing when, etc.

Any other thoughts or issues from the team?

GP

I see what you mean - the GTC's get attached to the confirms when they are 
sent out so the confirm desk needs to know which ones to attach if they are 
different.

That is correct,  but the possible GTC amendments will be part of the daily 
confirmation process.

 Dave

There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated 
transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for 
telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk 
the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the 
other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated 
trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the

Welcome to Enron!  I usually get to the London office a couple of times a 
year and will look forward to meeting you there.  If not, hopefully we'll see 
you at the Law Conference in the Spring.

Most of your e-mail is well outside my area of expertise.  Are you consulting 
me regarding the regulatory issues and section 10.2?  If so, it would help if 
you told me what 10.2 says.....

Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss.

Mark, I'm a new lawyer at Enron Europe, working with Mary Nell on the 
broadband team.  Robbi and I have had the below email coorespondence, and 
Robbi suggested that I check with you.  Any thoughts?

Peter Traung
18/01/2001 08:18
Robbi, I assumed that to be the way it would work, which seems to require 
that total non-performance is viewed as an SLA failure, presumably then in 
the form of Unavailability - if no seconds are delivered at all, then 
Unavailable Seconds certainly exceed any normal threshold - resulting in 
Credits.  But I was not able to access the actual definition of Unavailable 
Seconds thru the www.ansi.org website, but someone here should have them.  
There would then also be a cut-off date, beyond which Buyer would not have to 
be satisfied with only receiving Credits, when the Unavailable Seconds exceed 
the threshold determined for Product Termination Event thus enabling Buyer to 
terminate.  

But would not this construction become a bit strained if the ANSI standard 
refers to seconds that are unavailable in an otherwise up and running 
connection (as the reference to path performance monitoring may suggest)?  

When you prepared the document, did you consider explicitly dealing with 
total non-performance (for example, by explicitly stating, for the sake of 
clarification, that Unavailable Seconds shall also include the case where no 
seconds are delivered at all)?  

I understand that 10.2 (ii) is based on US regulatory requirements.  Are 
there any other sections that are solely based on such requirements?

Robbi Rossi@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS

Peter,

  In response to your voice message, if our supplier fails to deliver on 
time, we are entitled to collect liquidated damages from such supplier.  If 
we have resold the circuit and are unable to deliver to our customer because 
of the failure of our supplier, we in turn will have to pay our customer 
liquidated damages for late delivery.  This is why it is so important to 
"back to back" the trades to the extent possible.  Please let me know if you 
have any other questions.  Hang in there!

Hey Jim,

Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South 
Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to 
talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out 
what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and 
will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the 
continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's 
and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.

Let us know when you find a place to live

I hope you have access to e-mail in KW.  I'm down with the flu so we won't be

Alan Sommer, Mike Patrick and Bruce Garner have now left Enron Net Works.  
Alan has joined Rick Causey's group to run the SAP function and Bruce has 
moved into EIM to run their European Operations.  Mike Patrick has moved to 
work for Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale's accounting group.

Bruce's European group  will report up under Andy and his Houston group will 
report up under Greg.

Kerry Roper, as you know, has already joined to replace Mike.

We wish them all the best in their new roles and apologies if I have not 
included exactly the right titles for those of you moving on.

I may have missed it, but a VERY quick look at CNN's site showed no reports 
of computer virus activity since November.

Before sending this (or the "No Cure for this Virus") to anyone else, let me
check it out.

I'm suspect of any email - even a warning - that recommends you send it to
absolutely everyone you know.  I've forwarded it to one place, the
anti-virus people here at work.  If they're real (the viruses that is), the
tech'ies will know about them, or will know who to ask.

Hope all is well with everyone.

Very good question - while you don't need to worry about otc swaps, otc 
options might be a problem.  However, if the customer is not a US entity, the 
advice is all given outside the US and does not relate to US futures or 
options, we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there 
would be a problem.

Thanks for the response.  Does the term "futures contract" also include 
bilateral swaps (or it restricted to exchange-traded futures) and will it 
make any difference if the couterparty/customer is a non-US entity?!

I think the answers will be the same for Stockholm - i.e. as long as we are 
not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading 
advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange 
Act issues.

Mark, the business people posted at ECTRIC's office in Stockholm want to 
offer a Swedish forestry group portfolio management services and advisory 
services.  With reference to our previous conversations on the subject below, 
do you think that this may entail problems under US securities laws?!

Mark:

Did you have any luck with your New York law firm contact.   The other party 
has accepted the contents of the contract and wish to sign on Tuesday next 
week, why it's a bit urgent to flag any US securities law implications 
associated with the relevant transaction.

Does 4 central work for everyone for a conference call tomorrow with Ken?  

In case the Four Seasons doesn't work out, there are two other hotels 
downtown you might consider:  The Stephen F. Austin (an Intercontinental I 
think) and the Driskill.  Both are old (by U.S. standards) hotels that have 
been updated.  For several years after its renovation the Driskill was the 
nicest place in town - then came the Four Seasons.  The Stephen F. Austin was 
just completely redone a year or so ago - I haven't been inside but I hear 
they did a nice job.  Both are primarily business hotels so they may have 
good weekend rates.  

Sounds good to me.

Grassley Continues Effort to Overhaul Bankruptcy System
WASHINGTON - Sen. Chuck Grassley introduced legislation last night to
overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system.

The bill he introduced - S.220 - is identical to the final conference report
approved last year by the Senate and House of Representatives but
pocket-vetoed by President Clinton.

Grassley said that he looks forward to Senate action on the measure which
had veto-proof support last year. Senators voted 70-28 for the final
package, and the House gave the conference report unanimous approval in
December. Rep. George Gekas is expected to reintroduce the legislation in
the House.

The Senate Majority Leader has indicated that the bankruptcy reform bill
could be ready for consideration by the Senate as early as next week.
Grassley said the proposal which he sponsored last year with Sen. Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey "is unfinished business that has strong bipartisan
support in Congress and at the grassroots."

The reform measure is aimed at reducing the number of bankruptcies filed
each year by fixing weaknesses in the code and designing a more balanced,
fair approach for debtors and creditors. The number of bankruptcies have
soared during the last decade despite a historically strong economy. And,
according to a study released late last year, experts are predicting a 15
percent increase in bankruptcies in 2001.

The legislation advanced by Grassley and Gekas also includes permanent
status and an expansion of Chapter 12, which is tailored to help farmers
reorganize debt and stay in the business of farming. It also includes a
patients' bill of rights for residents of nursing homes and hospitals that
declare bankruptcy. Another key provision helps to strengthen the Medicare
Trust Fund by prohibiting the discharge of debts arising from inflated bills
and fraudulent claims.

The legislation reintroduced today reflects the bipartisan, bicameral
agreement reached late last year on the most comprehensive reform of
bankruptcy law since 1978.

Grassley said "reforming the system will be good for consumers and families.
It would bring more fairness for those who work hard to pay their bills.
Every bankruptcy filed puts upward pressure on interest rates, so decreasing
the number is good for people trying to buy a new house or pay for a car.
Reforming the bankruptcy system will help usher in a new era of greater
personal responsibility." The Iowa senator began his effort to reform the
bankruptcy system in 1997, when he held a hearing on the relationship
between credit card debt and consumer bankruptcy.

The bill that resulted addresses the problems caused by irresponsible
consumerism, an aggressive credit industry, lax bankruptcy laws and
lawyer-run bankruptcy mills. It sets up a flexible formula for bankruptcy
judges to channel those with repayment capacity to Chapter 13. Currently,
the overwhelming majority of debtors file under Chapter 7, which effectively
wipes away their debts. Only about one-third of debtors opt to file under
Chapter 13, which requires some repayment plan to reimburse creditors.

The measure also seeks to improve the bankruptcy system for consumers by
promoting credit counseling services and educational courses for debtors
prior to filing a bankruptcy petition. The plan strengthens enforcement and
penalties against coercive tactics by creditors. It penalizes creditors who
seek a double-payment and establishes tough penalties for creditors who use
threats to coerce debtors into voluntarily agreeing to pay a debt which
could be wiped away in bankruptcy.

The legislation will minimize court dockets and keep costs down. It promotes
the alternative dispute resolution process by saying that if someone in
financial trouble tries in good faith to work out a reasonable repayment
plan, but a creditor rejects this, then the ability of the creditor to
collect in bankruptcy will be sharply curtailed.

The bill also would make Chapter 12 for farmers a permanent part of the
bankruptcy code. The package strengthens this tool for farmers by making an
increased number of farmers eligible for Chapter 12 protections and making
the federal government last on the list of creditors when a farmer sells
farm assets during reorganization. Changing the treatment of capital gains
taxes under Chapter 12 would give farmers greater flexibility in
reorganizing their financial affairs.

Finally, the reform proposal includes:

- a provision to protect quality of care for patients - especially nursing
home residents - when a health care provider is in bankruptcy. Current law
does not guarantee the well-being of patients in a bankruptcy case. Two
years ago, residents of a California nursing home were literally evicted
onto the street by a bankruptcy trustee.

- a provision setting new requirements for credit card companies and protect
consumers. These provisions reflect some of the most significant
pro-consumer legislation considered by the Senate in a decade. Under the
measure, creditors are required to display prominently a minimum payment
warning on every credit card statement. This feature would include a
toll-free number for credit card holders to learn how many months it would
take to repay a certain balance with minimum monthly payments. It also
requires credit card solicitations to disclose when a low introductory rate
ends and what the subsequent rate will be. And, it requires credit card
solicitations via the Internet to comply with the Truth in Lending Act.

- unprecedented new protections for child support claimants. The reform bill
allows claimants to access otherwise off-limits property and has the support
of key child support advocates.

- limits on the ability of individuals to protect assets by purchasing an
expensive home. Right now, there are no limits on the value of a homestead
that is off-limits to creditors. Although the General Accounting Office
found only scant evidence of systemic abuse of the homestead exemption, the
bankruptcy reform bill includes changes long-advocated by Sen. Herb Kohl of
Wisconsin and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to put a $100,000 cap on home
equity acquired within two years prior to declaring bankruptcy. The
Kohl-Sessions proposal requires that an individual establish residency for
two years prior to bankruptcy in order to claim the homestead exemption of a
particular state. The bill also allows creditors to seize any home equity
acquired with the intent to delay or hinder collection efforts within seven
years prior to declaring bankruptcy. And it says the home equity built up
applies to the $100,000 cap even if an individual relocates from one state
to another.

Since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100
percent. Since 1980, the number of Americans declaring bankruptcy has
exploded from 331,264 to just under 1.4 million last year. Filings began to
increase dramatically after 1985, despite the strong economy.

I'm very flexible on who comes along - no views at all on that score.  It 
would help to know the number and cabin sharing arrangement ahead of time so 
we can book the correct size boat.  You can always change the amount of 
groceries but at some point all the boats will be reserved.

I called Keswick last week and gave them my credit card number for the extra 
room - it looks great from the website.  Will you be golfing or should we 
make massage appointments?  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure which 
days we have reserved - another alternative might be to stay near DC on the 
day we get back from sailing (Inn at Little Washington?).  My guess is it's 
an all day affair getting from a little island to DC so we may get in pretty 
late.

I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo=

The EnronOnline team has asked if we can discontinue sending copies of the 
GTC's when EnronOnline transactions are confirmed.  They have suggested a 
sentence be added to the confirmation to the effect that it is subject to the 
GTC's which can be accessed on the website.  Any thoughts?

I don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way.  Maybe if you 
can give me a little more detail I could help.

I would appreciate your comments.  We are reviewing costs following the 
Africa reorg, and in preparation for the QBR.

Thanks!

April payroll records show that you charged time to J3025 - Benin (Africa - 
Sean Long's Group).  Would you please confirm whether this is the correct 
project?  If these hours need to be moved to another project, we can make the 
transfer if you provide us with the project code.

By now, you should all have your travel plans finalized.  Please help us in 
planning by providing your itinerary including flights and arrival/departure 
times to Marvia Jefferson if you haven't already done so.  We need this by 
tomorrow morning if possible, so we can finalize all plans for meals and 
transportation.   Please review the attached document for additional details 
on the ASE event including hotel, transportation, and schedule.  Changes from 
the previous communication have been highlighted in blue.

In addition, here are driving directions to and from various places should 
you require them.

Should you have any further questions, please feel free to call either myself 
at x3-6079 or Marvia at x3-9165.

See you in Dallas!

As you are all aware, the legal department has grown significantly over the 
last several months.  While so far we have been able to find places for 
everyone to sit, we have not added significantly to the available file 
cabinet space on the floor.  In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in 
locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements.

Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office 
space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible, 
give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.  Once 
we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to 
allocate the available file cabinet space.  Most if not all of us will have 
to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we 
each reduce our file space usage to our fair share.

We have arranged for representatives from tax, accounting, commercial, and 
legal to make presentations relating to the purpose, structure, mechanics, 
etc. associated with the Whitewing/Condor deconsolidated affiliate.  I think 
that the more all of us are "conversant" with that structure, it should 
simplify the legal efforts in closing deals---especially in Q4.  To that end, 
please invite those colleagues of yours that could benefit from this 
presentation and please let my assistant, Darlene Forsyth at x37254 , know 
who will be attending so we can reserve the right size conference room and 
order lunch.

Thanks.

There is a master agreement in place between ECT and Koch Energy Trading, 
Inc.  I have never heard of Koch Carbon.  My immediate concern is as to the 
Enron entity.  It is not clear to me why Peter thinks this trade is between 
ECT and a Koch entity since he does not have authority to bind ECT.

Ken:

I have no idea how any of my time would have been charged to an Africa 
project.  Of course, I have no idea how any of my time gets charged to any 
project so my ignorance shouldn't be used as a guide.  In any event, if it is 
my time, it is clearly there in error.  Is there any detail describing what I 
am supposed to have done during those hours?  That might help me redirect the 
errant time to  where it belongs.  There used to be another Mark E. Taylor at 
Enron.  He worked for EI and was based in London.  Any chance this is his 
time?

Mark

Mark,

In April 1999 we're showing that you charged 184 hours to J3025 Benin (Sean 
Long).  Did you work on this project or any other Africa projects, e.g. for 
Tony Way, during this time period?

Basically, we are evaluating whether some employees may have accidentally 
charged to Sean's projects, whereas they meant to charge to Tony's.

Thanks, Mark!
Ken

I don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way. Maybe if you 
can give me a little more detail I could help.

I would appreciate your comments.  We are reviewing costs following the 
Africa reorg, and in preparation for the QBR.

I wanted to provide you with an update on this dispute.

As you will recall, we originally thought that we were the buyer on a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 and Conectiv/Delmarva was the seller.  At 
least that is what our deal ticket indicated.  Conectiv/Delmarva disagreed 
vehemently, contending that they were the buyer and we were the seller.

Last week I obtained the tapes from the broker, Natsource.  I previously 
forwarded the tapes to you.  The tapes unequivocally indicate that we were 
the seller.  In fact, the tapes reflect that we sold two Nov '00 - March '01 
basis swap @ Transco Z6 contracts at the same time -- one to 
Conectiv/Delmarva and one to Duke.  We have gone back and checked our records 
to see if we actually sold a Nov '00 - March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 
contract to Duke at the same time we entered into a deal with 
Conectiv/Delmarva.  We did.  Notwithstanding the clear language on the tape, 
it would be hard to explain with a straight face why we would sell a swap to 
Duke and buy a swap from Conectiv/Delmarva at the same time.

After the trade, Natsource sent us a confirmation, indicating that we were 
the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva was the buyer.  Although we sent 
Conectiv/Delmarva a confirm (and they signed it) reflecting that we were the 
buyer and they were the seller, we settled the swap for the first two months 
as if we were the seller and they were the buyer.

The long and short of it is that, from a legal standpoint, there is no 
question whatsoever that the intention of the parties was that Enron would be 
the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva would be the buyer.  This is not even a 
close call.  It is my advice that we should settle the trade as if we are the 
seller and Conectiv/Delmarva is the buyer, and move on.

The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.  
Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the 
hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.  
Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at 
the ASE.

Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since 
arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own 
devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday 
night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are 
planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back 
to the hotel. 

I spoke with Susan Bulgawicz again today.  She relates the following points:

Gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for 
the new building generally
While our work is probably in addition to that already agreed (and will 
therefore be billed to us) it should be covered by an amendment to the 
existing agreement rather than a new, separate agreement
Bill Donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as 
near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to 
redo the work (and pay twice) to take into account new factors not apparent 
earlier (e.g. organizational and technology changes)
Bill's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing 
this work for the legal department

Susan suggested that you might want to call Bill to discuss this and talk 
about how you want to move forward.

USA:
INTERVIEW-Online exchange TradeSpark says building critical mass.
By Andrew Kelly

02/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - TradeSpark, an online energy exchange launched late
last year, said on Thursday it was making good progress toward its goal of
establishing itself as a liquid marketplace for trading energy products.

"We expect certainly by the end of this year to have critical mass in certain
instruments, in certain products, and to be the (trading) platform of record,"
Managing Director Mike Williams told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Earlier on Thursday, TradeSpark (www.tradespark.com) said it had clocked up
energy trades with a notional value of more than $16 billion since it opened
for trading on Oct 2, 2000.

Natural gas accounted for over $9 billion of the trades logged so far and
electricity for about $6 billion.

TradeSpark also said that more than 125 companies and roughly 550 traders are
currently registered to use the system to execute their energy transactions.

It was the first time that the limited partnership had released data on
trading volumes and user numbers.

Most electronic energy trading platforms have been reluctant to release such
information and analysts have predicted that only a handful who succeed in
generating large volumes of business relatively quickly, will survive the
inevitable shakeout ahead.

SYSTEM USERS INCLUDE ENRON

Williams said TradeSpark had already signed up "all the big names" in North
America's wholesale natural gas and electricity business, including its
800-pound gorilla, Enron Corp..

"They are a user of the system. They've been a customer of ours since we
started," he said of Enron, though he declined to provide further details
about Enron's use of TradeSpark.

Enron launched its own electronic trading platform, EnronOnline
(www.enrononline.com), in late 1999 and used it to execute deals worth $336
billion last year. EnronOnline is a bilateral trading system on which Enron
posts buy and sell prices and is either the buyer or seller in any deals that
take place.

Williams said bilateral and multilateral platforms were completely different
and that both could coexist in harmony.

Enron, for its part, has said it is willing to use any kind of trading
platform that helps its traders to do business.

TradeSpark's founding partners include electronic commerce firm eSpeed Inc.,
brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, energy firms Williams Cos. and TXU Corp. and
Royal Dutch/Shell affiliate Coral Energy.

Dynegy Inc., which also has its own bilateral trading platform, Dynegydirect
(dynegydirect.com), has used TradeSpark from its launch and has also announced
plans to become a partner in the venture at a later date.

Despite some of the big energy names associated with TradeSpark, Williams
emphasized its neutrality, including anonymity of the prices posted on the
system.

In January, traders who were not associated with one of TradeSpark's founding
partners accounted for 58 percent of all trades, up from 48 percent in
December.

Williams said TradeSpark would expand its product offerings next month to add
physical natural gas products alongside the financial gas instruments
currently available.

Financial electricity instruments will also be added some time this year, he
said, to complement the physical electricity products on offer now.

I just returned from the Bond Market Association meeting this afternoon on
the pending bankruptcy legislation.  Chris Long (Enron) was there with
Ellen Levinson of our Washington office.
The "big" issue discussed was whether to push hard for amendments on
cross-affiliate netting.  The consensus was that while everyone in the room
(and all of Wall Street was there,as well as ISDA and commodities groups)
wants the amendments, they are considered controversial by the President's
Working Group and could derail progress on the version of bankruptcy reform
currently before Congress which everyone also agrees is very good
legislation for financial markets participants.  On the basis that getting
the current bill enacted quickly is of paramount importance, the
Association determined to "back pocket" the cross-affiliate netting issue,
meaning that if the current legislation moves quickly, the Association will
not raise the issue but if the legislation gets bogged down in committee
and other nontechnical changes are being proposed, the Association will use
that opportunity to add cross-affiliate netting provisions.

Feel free to call if you have any questions.

Mark, I am getting complaints by traders and orginators that  they are 
missing significant commercial opportunities, especially in our newly 
deregulated power market, as they are unable to get ISDAs turned around.  
Frankly, I do not know what is the cause for the delay, or whether it is 
Legal, Credit or Enron Corp. Legal, or the specific cases.  I do know that 
Enmax Energy Corp. and Encore Energy Solutions are two specific cases on the 
power side.  Can you look into this and let me know if we (Legal) can speed 
up the process.

My husband and I will be celebrating our first anniversary on August 1st, and 
plan to take trip to St. Maarten.  I would like to take schedule vacation 
time from Friday, July 30th thru Friday, August 6th.  I would return to the 
office on Monday, August 9th.  I hope this meets with your approval.

Thanks. 

Francisco - Here is an ISDA that Peggy needs in connection with a project she 
is working on in Mexico.  Can you take care of this one?  It looks like it is 
a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.  Sara can 
probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that 
would be ok.

Attached are some comments from Enron's outside counel on the draft ISDA 
Master Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier this week.

Could you please advise who is reviewing this document and when their review 
might be completed.

Thank you for your assistance.

Attached is the email forwarding the draft swap agt with SG.

Rogelio--please take a look at the docs required in Part 3-- some changes 
will need to be made I am sure to reflect that EEIM is a Mexican 
company--please fax me a markup with your suggested changes.  It looks like 
we are going to need Mexican Power of Attorney for CT Corp. for this 
agreement also.

Carlyn--please look at the CT Corp. appointment letter and let me know if any 
hedging agt is contemplated to be included.  We may need a separate 
appointment letter for this document (see Part 5, clause (vi)) -- note also 
that the jurisdictional consent language is different than in the Loan Agt 
and most of the other IDB docs--I don't think we care but I will point it out 
to SG--they may want to conform the language to have the same court 
jurisdiction.

Mike--on substantive issues, please call me when you get back into town and 
have a moment to talk.  I spoke with one of my partners in Houston who is 
much more familiar with swaps and he thinks it looks ok for the most part--I 
have only a few questions/comments for you.

Thanks all!

Re: Proposed Regulations Providing for Ordinary Character Treatment
for Certain Hedging Transactions

                     Attached is a memorandum, dated February 12, 2001,
from Sullivan & Cromwell concerning the above subject. A summary is
also included at the end of the text of this e-mail message.

                     The attached file is in Adobe Acrobat
format.  We believe most PCs will already have an Acrobat viewer
loaded; we can provide free copies if Acrobat is not already loaded,
and free copies can also be downloaded from the Adobe Acrobat web
site at www.adobe.com.  To view or print the memo use your e-mail
system's function for opening attachments in their native format.
Hard copies can be obtained from Ivy Moreno at S&C in New York,
telephone 212-558-3448, e-mail: Morenoi@sullcrom.com.

SUMMARY

                    On January 18, 2001, the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") issued proposed regulations (the
"Proposed Regulations") under Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code (the "Code") providing for the income and
loss from most business hedging transactions to be treated
as ordinary.

                   The Proposed Regulations reflect changes
made to Section 1221 by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives
Improvement Act of 1999.  The Proposed Regulations are
practically identical to existing regulations under Section
1221 (the "Existing Regulations") with two modifications
reflecting the changes in the law -- (1) they adopt a risk
"management" standard for defining a hedging transaction
(as opposed to the risk "reduction" standard used in the
Existing Regulations) and (2) they remove the special
rule imposing certain additional conditions on hedges of
non-inventory supplies.  The Existing Regulations have not
been withdrawn, but the Proposed Regulations are proposed
to be effective for transactions entered into on or after
January 18, 2001.

When we meet this afternoon I'd also like to discuss the Canadian traders 
using EnronOnline average prices as an index for financial trades.

Apparently this came yesterday but I didn't see it since it didn't come 
directly from David.  Sorry about that.

Mark,

I have attached our draft version of the Enron License and Services Agreement.

As we discussed on our call, there are a number of issues which require 
clarification and which we have highlighted in the Agreement. There are a 
number of areas, in particular Service Support, were we have proposed 
possible approaches but we obviously do not know whether these suggestions 
will work for Enron or are consistent with the intention to run the service ( 
e.g., Service Levels in Schedule B.)

If you have any comments or questions please email or call either myself at 
(212) 558-3491, David at (212) 558-4680 or Anna at (202) 956-7575.

Regards,

Kieran McIntyre

Mark,
Please find attached our first revision of the EnronOnline Service Agreement 
Draft. As you may notice on your calendar, we asked Holly to schedule a 
conference call with Sullivan & Crom well for today @11:00 to go over our 
comments and their questions. Please, if you consider convenient, forward 
them this document so they have it before the conference call and we can go 
directly to our comments.
Some of the additional issues we want to talk to them/ you are:
We are not licensing the Stack Manager, we are just giving them access to it, 
therefore there is no "Software License"
Prohibit Pipeline's usage of EnonOnline name without our written approval
Default & Remedies
Definitions to be added
Invoicing & Terms of payment
Marketing Brochures & materials
Define Schedule B & C (Support Services & Termination payments), and
Timeline

We really appreciate your help in pushing this, as you know we need to have 
this document finalised by no latter than Tuesday morning, since Dave is 
meeting with NGPL on Wednesday,
Thanks
Carlos

I am forwarding the amendment revisions discussed on this morning's call.

Attached are revised versions of the summary of proposed changes to
S.220/H.333 and the markup of the bill.  The only changes are to the new
provisions (in riders 344A and 352A of the markup) dealing with rulemaking
authority for the SEC and CFTC to address the treatment of accounts in
which both securities and futures are carried.  For your convenience, we
have included both clean and blacklined versions of the summary.  --

No problem - I'm glad we go it straightened out.  Do you do any work with Yao 
Apasu in Legal?  Yao & I go way back.

Mark,

You hit the nail on the head - it is indeed the Mark Taylor in London.  I'm 
relatively new to the Africa organization, and was not aware that there had 
been two Marks at one time.

I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you with this.

Ken

Ken:

I have no idea how any of my time would have been charged to an Africa 
project.  Of course, I have no idea how any of my time gets charged to any 
project so my ignorance shouldn't be used as a guide.  In any event, if it is 
my time, it is clearly there in error.  Is there any detail describing what I 
am supposed to have done during those hours?  That might help me redirect the 
errant time to  where it belongs.  There used to be another Mark E. Taylor at 
Enron.  He worked for EI and was based in London.  Any chance this is his 
time?

Mark

Mark,

In April 1999 we're showing that you charged 184 hours to J3025 Benin (Sean 
Long).  Did you work on this project or any other Africa projects, e.g. for 
Tony Way, during this time period?

Basically, we are evaluating whether some employees may have accidentally 
charged to Sean's projects, whereas they meant to charge to Tony's.

Thanks, Mark!
Ken

I don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way. Maybe if you 
can give me a little more detail I could help.

I would appreciate your comments.  We are reviewing costs following the 
Africa reorg, and in preparation for the QBR.

Thanks!
Ken
Kenneth Horton on 06/23/99 06:13:47 PM

April payroll records show that you charged time to J3025 - Benin (Africa - 
Sean Long's Group).  Would you please confirm whether this is the correct 
project?  If these hours need to be moved to another project, we can make the 
transfer if you provide us with the project code.

Thank you,
Ken

 Here's the article I mentioned.  (Also in today's Press Report -
with same copyright caveat!).

 This is particularly interesting in light of our conversation on the
May 7-8 Mexico City ISDA Conference we are planning.  The agenda is "in
formation".  Jose Manuel (Board liaison) and Diane Genova (Chair) of the
Latin American Committee are enthusiastically involved and Pedro is our
staff liaison.  We have great support from the Bank of Mexico, NAFINSA,
Mexder (the exchange) and the Mexican Banking Association (all of which will
contribute speakers).  We would very much welcome one or more Enron speakers
- particularly from the region.  (We contemplate simultaneous
Spanish/English and English/Spanish translation to accommodate and encourage
both English and Spanish speakers).  Bob, Diane, Jose Manuel will also be
speakers.

 Here's a preview of the still very preliminary (and uncirculated)
Agenda:

 DAY 1:

 _morning
 Intro
 Keynote
 History and Development of OTC Derivatives
 Legal and Regulatory Standards in the Global Derivatives Markets
 Risk Mangement in the Derivatives Markets
 Overview of ISDA and current Activities

 _afternoon
 3 Workshops*
 I.  Comparative analysis:  Local Master Agreements and the ISDA
Master Agreement
 II.  Current Approaches to Risk Management
 III.  Financial Innovation: Growth and New Products*

 DAY 2'

 Keynote:  Economic Outlook
 Panel:  OTC Derivatives in Emerging Markets _ Latin American Focus*
 Credit and Equity Derivatives
 Review of New Bankruptcy Law and Regulatory Developments
 OTC Derivatives and Repo Transactions in Mexico
 Accounting and Tax Treatment of Derivatives and Repos in Mexico
 Synergy between Exchanges and OTC Derivatives in Mexico*

 I've put asterisks in several places where Enron would be a terrific
addition.  Other areas may also be appropriate.  Please let Diane, Pedro or
me know your thoughts.  Thak you.

 Best regards, Ruth

> power in the spot market to keep the plant running at a loss.
>
> During the drought, Endesa was unable to buy adequate hydroelectric output
> and had to rely on older, inefficient fossil fuel power plants to
> supplement hydroelectric production. Since then, Chile has begun importing
> natural gas power through the $325 million GasAndes pipeline from Mendoza
> in Argentina.
>
> Power companies in Brazil currently rely on assured power arrangements in

> The rising number of natural gas-fired merchant power projects, which sell

>
> Jeff Kabel, director of trading and origination for Enron Argentina, says

> Sodeyama "absolutely expects a secondary market as the energy market

>
> Enron's Stoiani agrees that "a couple of years down the road the market

> weather, as well as additional interest from speculators." With the growth
> in liquidity, Stoiani foresees opportunities for arbitrage and
> cross-commodity trading. He says "a hydroelectric plant with no natural
> gas-fired back-up plant could purchase a derivative paying out gas units
> in times of low precipitation."
>

This was the last e-mail from Leslie on the topic.  We talked afterwards and 
I thought she was going to talk to Andy about this but never heard back.

As per my voice mail and Mark's e-mail, Mark would prefer to eliminate 
NetWorks from the review process.  Do you think Andy will object to 
eliminating NetWork's from the process?  Instead, he prefers to instruct all 
traders to flow all necessary documentation through Mark Greenberg or myself 
to ensure consistent legal review.  I have revised the policy accordingly.

Please review and let me know what you think.

Leslie

Vikas - 

Thanks for your note.  Enron does have a policy that somewhat restricts the 
trading that may be done by employees - even when they are not involved in a 
trading function.  No Enron employee is permitted to trade any commodity for 
their own account (or for the account of another) which Enron trades.  The 
only general exceptions to this are for equity and debt securities - and 
there are special restrictions on persons who trade those items for Enron.  
This policy is modified from time to time by the Enron Corp. Board of 
Directors and is monitored by the Risk Assessment and Control Group.  I 
believe Cassandra Schultz currently has that responsibility.  I am sending 
her a copy of this e-mail (so in case I have misrepresented the policy in 
some way, Cassandra please correct me) and if you need any further 
information, please contact her.

Mark,

I am interested in opening a personal commodity trading account.  I'm not 
involved in a trading function here at Enron.  My manager Jennifer Fraser 
suggested I write you to find out what steps I need to take to ensure 
compliance before I open the account.

Your guidance on the subject is appreciated.

Thanks, Vikas

Gentlemen:

Several points regarding the below:

We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement 
with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC 
wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was 
the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact 
someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a 
master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone 
in my group to get that process started.
The e-mail from Dow indicates:
 "TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included 
in the
confirmations sent by Enron."
All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our 
confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them 
should stop immediately on legal grounds.
The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.  Does someone 
here have it?

Let's hope it works out better this time.

Meetings have been held this week on bankruptcy reform with the CFTC and the
Treasury Department. FDIC also hosted a technical meeting this morning with
the FED, SEC, Treasury and CFTC.  Seth Grosshandler, Josh Cohn and Geoff
Goldman attended on behalf of the Bond Market Association and ISDA.

Various modifications have been made to our package as a result of these
meetings in an attempt to facilitate an amendment package the administration
will be able to support and send to the Capitol Hill for inclusion into the
overall bill.  These modifications are reflected in a revised Summary
Document page that will be faxed to you this morning.

I have been through the advice received from Swedish counsel. The position of 
CDs under Swedish law can be summarised as follows.

1.  Regulation

CDs are regulated in Sweden in the same way as commodity derivatives. As 
discussed we are currently working through these issues as they relate to 
commodity derivatives with local counsel and I will be pressing them to take 
a less cautious approach than they have taken to date (particularly in light 
of our expanding presence in Sweden). As you know, our target is to avoid 
Swedish licencing requirements and the accompanying regulatory capital 
requirements. In the meantime, this uncertainty will not prevent us from 
dealing in Norway with Swedish parties based in Norway.

2.  Insurance

CDs are not analysed as contracts of insurance under Swedish law.

3.  Guarantees

  CDs are not analysed as contracts of guarantee under Swedish law.

4.  Gaming

CDs are not analysed as gaming contracts under Swedish law and (unusually) we 
do not even need to go so far as to satisfy ourselves that the contract is 
being entered into by the counterparty for a valid commercial purpose (i e 
hedging).  However, it should be noted that several types of entity may not 
enter derivatives at all for speculative purposes (e g municipalities, 
insurance companies).

5.  Confidentiality

This could be an issue for Enron even where we are selling the CD, where we 
have good reason to believe there is breach of the purchaser's duty of 
confidentiality owed to the reference credit (i e where we are not in good 
faith). The position would of course be potentially more problematical where 
we are purchasing the CD.  That said, it would be difficult in either case 
for the reference credit to establish loss (e g  damage to reputation), so it 
would be hard for them to launch a claim.  Our exposure could be restricted 
further by passing on no more information about underlying reference 
contracts than is absolutely necesssary.   I am pusuing this further with 
Clifford Chance, in particular to find out what the practice is in the London 
and New York credit derivative markets where the issue of confidentaility 
arises and I will revert to you when I have more information. Perhaps 
Merrills could shed some light on this?

6.  Subrogation & Assignment

Since CDs are not guarantees there is no right of subrogation.  It is 
possible to take an assignment of the counterparty's rights against the 
reference credit, but this will not work so as to allow Enron a right of set 
off against the reference credit where Enron is aware of the reference 
credit's insolvency at the time of the assignment (a reasonable bet) or where 
the latter becomes bankrupt within three months of the assignment.  In 
effect, this will make it very difficult indeed to extract any value at all 
(including by way of set off) from the reference credit.

Please feel free to call me on x 6566 to discuss this and to pass this note 
on to other interested staff.

Best regards

Paul

I think the "Wes" we were looking for the other day may be Wes Colwell who I 
think may be in charge of accounting for ENA.  If not, maybe somebody on this

The above PDF file is the latest version of the TBMA/ISDA bankruptcy
amendments reflecting discussions at yesterday's FDIC meeting.  Note that
other regulators (including Treasury, SEC, CFTC, the FED (NY and Washington,
FDIC) were also in attendance at yesterday's meeting.

We currently await the outcome of this morning's staff meeting of financial
regulators. The focus of this meeting was to discuss the BMA/ISDA amendment
package.

Mark -

Francisco thinks that picking up Columbia would not be a big problem and that 
he can manage all of his Wholesale work while watching Columbia.  To my 
knowledge, Columbia should not present substantial work and would benefit 
from Francisco's watch.

I'm trying to keep Francisco working on EGA matters that he knows well and/or 
are less likely to "balloon."  Francisco has been willing to tackle a bit 
more than he currently has on his EGA plate, but he is also sensitive to 
making sure that he has sufficient time for all of his responsibilities.

Let me know if you have concerns.

Bruce

Mark -

Given that South America legal resources are stretched thin, we will be 
checking with Francisco to see if he has time to pick up Columbia.  He knows 
it well and I don't believe that it will be particularly time-consuming for 
him.  But it would help free up Miguel Mendoza a bit for other South America 
matters.

I will expect Francisco to be cognizant of his other Wholesale obligations in 
saying "yes" or "no."

They don't have the exclusive line (brand new) boat for our week but they do 
have this one.  If you can get in the night before we can actually stay on 
the boat and leave early in the morning - effectively getting an extra day of

Attached is the amendment package forwarded to the hill on Friday afternoon.
Note that unlike earlier versions, which amended the Senate Bill S.220, this
package amends the House Bill H.R.333.  It is also a line-by-line mark-up
instead of a hand written mark-up of the actual bill.

House Financial Services Committee staff is working with the Legislative
Counsel of the House of Representatives to put our amendments in draft form.
We will forward the final amendment as soon as it is received.  It appears
that our amendments will be offered by Chairman Oxley and will not be
included in the Sensenbrenner amendment.

The House Rules Committee is meeting on the legislation at 2:00 on
Wednesday. A floor vote is expected on Thursday.

I can be reached on 917-543-9622 should you have any questions.  Many
thanks.   Stacy

Attached is a revised version of the amendment package to H.R.333.  We have
included both the annotated and unannotated versions, as well as a
blackline showing changes from yesterday's version. The only changes are
(1) an addition in the definition of master netting agreement on page 334
relating to guarantees and reimbursement obligations in respect of such
agreements, which we understand is acceptable to Mike Krimminger at the
FDIC, (2) the deletion of an incorrect section numbering change on page
351, and (3) the insertion of a revised "placeholder" provision on page 348
relating to rulemaking by the SEC and CFTC to address the treatment of
security futures products and joint securities/futures accounts in the
insolvency context.  As we have mentioned, the placeholder is intended to
be replaced by substantive language following further discussions between
the SEC and CFTC (and would presumably be removed if the agencies do not
agree on substantive language).   Although we have discussed the substance
of the new placeholder provision with the SEC and CFTC, the SEC has not yet
signed off on the specific language.  We understand that although the CFTC
does not "endorse" the placeholder language, it does not object to its
inclusion as a placeholder for this purpose.

Please feel free to call Seth Grosshandler (at 212-225-2542) or me (at
212-225-2234) with any questions or comments regarding the attached.

The Bond Market Association and ISDA have circulated the attached letter in
support of our amendment package to other trade associations asking for
their decision about joining the letter by noon tomorrow.  The purpose of
the letter is to signal widespread support for the netting amendment
package.  It has been proposed that individual firms also have the
opportunity to sign the attached letter. To that end, would you please let
me know if your firm will be or will not be in a position to sign the letter
tomorrow.  Many thanks --   Stacy

Senate Activity - The Senate Judiciary Committee completed its mark-up today
on S.220.  Senator Schumer offered an amendment reflecting the majority of
our amendment package.  The Schumer Amendment was adopted except for
provisions relating to Section 708 which received objection by Senator
Grassley.  Schumer's staff indicated they will attempt to work this out
w/Grassley before floor consideration tomorrow.

House Activity - The House Rules Committee made in order the Oxley-LaFalce
amendment, which reflects the majority of our netting amendment package.
Better news is that the amendment is alloted only 10 minutes of debate.
Note that the Financial Services Committee was not able to get language on
Section 708 and the SEC savings language included in the legislation due to
objection by the House Judiciary Committee. The amendment will be offered on
the House floor tomorrow.  Attached is the Oxley Amendment filed with the
Rules Committee and the letter we circulated to Chairman Drier, House
Leadership, and contacts on the Financial Services, Judiciary and
Agriculture Committees.  The SEC issue prevented release of our letter
earlier because they would not authorize PWG agreement without the savings
clause language.  They were convinced to withdraw their objection on a
promise that the Financial Services Committee would work to get this
language adopted in conference. Additionally, we understand that Chairman
Sensenbrenner may grumble about the Oxley amendment but will not raise any
formal objection.

To the extent you are able I would recommend sharing our letter with any
contacts you have with Members that are inclined to be involved in
tomorrow's debate and are inclined to be helpful -- particularly those on
the Financial Services and Judiciary Committees.

Note:  Due to the SEC snafu we were not able to circulate the letter to the
Senate today.  We are attempting to rework the letter to reflect the Schumer
amendment in hope that it still may be useful tomorrow.

We have received word that Conyers and House Judiciary Democrats will oppose
the Oxley Amendment based on jurisdiction and acceptance of substantial
amendments.  We further understand that Gephardt remains supportive of the
amendment.  I would encourage as many calls as possible to the list of
members below encouraging support of the Oxley/LaFalce Amendment.

Points to keep in mind/mention:
- Most of the amendments are necessary to conform bankruptcy statute to the
Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed last year.
- Certain other provisions are necesary in order to update the bankruptcy
code for financial product netting.
- These are necessary to diminish systemic risk to the financial system.
- This is a bipartisan amendment supported by John LaFalce.
- Please support the Oxley-LaFalce Amendment.

Just wanted to say hello.  I hadn't heard from you lately and wondered how 
things were going.  Have you moved out of the hotel yet?  I know how 
depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night.  Even though the 
hotel where I lived for the first three months I was in Jakarta was very 
nice, it was still just a hotel room.  I was so glad to get out of there into 
an apartment - major quality of life improvement.

We've been just busy enough for me this month: Austin for a couple of days on 
Presidents' Day weekend, a Rockets game last Friday, and we're off to the 
Diverse Works annual gala on Saturday.   Ted wants to leave town to do 
something - anything - next weekend but I'm trying to talk him out of it 
since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following Saturday.  
Since my arguments carry no weight, I'm just lucky that air fares are 
surprisingly high right now - $1000 rt to Ft. Lauderdale is even too high for 
Ted.

Ted's brother is working on a  project here in town so we had him over the 
other night for dinner.  Ted had planned - can you guess - tuna steaks, 
having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish.  How do 
you just forget something like that?  Luckily they went to the gym ahead of 
time and Ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and 
bought his brother a steak on the way home.

That nice January bump in Enron's stock price is ancient history now - pretty 
much the whole thing has been given back.  I'm still going to buy a new car - 
looks like an Audi A6 - but just one.

Hope you are doing well!

The cruise is a western Caribbean cruise on a Carnival Lines ship - leaving 
from Galveston on the 17th.  I'm actually looking forward to it.  I may not 
be partying with the best of them (or have a body that would entitle me to 
even try) but a week in warm weather in a deck chair with a good book and a 
waiter bringing tropical drinks is sounding really good right now.

As for Europe, Ted is thinking London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Finland, Iceland 
and Norway (think blond and English speaking).  Personally, I'm reasonably 
flexible, but I'd rather go biking or barging through the wine country in 
France or relaxing in a Tuscan hill town or villa than disco-hopping through 
another Scandinavian capital or revisiting the bars in London.  Berlin, 
Prague and Budapest appeal since I've never been to any of them.  Or maybe I 
can get over to Barcelona just before your cruise with Ted - maybe with a few 
days in the wine country or Madrid beforehand?

Rahil,

According to Clifford Chance, our European Legal Advisor, this disclaimer 
must be driven by regulatory and investment issues in US, i.e. SEC 
requirements. 
In Europe, the paragraph like this would not be necessary in the ress 
release, but as our press release will be issued in US, it may need further 
investigation with US lawyers.... 

Rahil Jafry
29/06/99 11:10
Pls. note the disclaimer at the end of the message (highlighted in red).
Justin/Gary, is there a specific legal or PR related reason for this?
Would we have to make similar disclaimers in our press release?  Gary and I
are working on draft press releases currently and will forward those for
your approval soon.

Trading Megawatts On the Web: Houston Street Exchange
Launches First Fully Web-Based Trading Floor and Portal for
the Electric Power Industry

Business Wire - June 28, 1999 08:32
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 28, 1999-- HoustonStreet.com alters
power trading
landscape by increasing the efficiency of how power is bought and sold
Electric power. It's quickly becoming one of the world's largest traded
commodities, yet it's one of the last to be bought and sold over the
Internet. But that's about to change today when Houston Street Exchange
introduces HoustonStreet.com, a new online electric power trading floor that
allows power traders to buy and sell electricity faster and better than
before.
Houston Street Exchange hopes to do for the power industry what E
rade did for the stock market: turn the industry upside down by bringing
together buyers and sellers in a real-time, efficient online format. This
will shift the control of the $70 billion wholesale power market in the
United States by putting it directly into the hands of power marketers,
utilities and other traders that are entering the increasingly deregulated
energy market. HoustonStreet.com serves as a portal for power traders,
providing critical information regarding weather, energy news, stocks and
other direct links necessary for trading electricity. HoustonStreet.com is
pioneering the emerging business-to-business e-commerce power trading
market.
Lights out for phones, static Web sites
HoustonStreet.com delivers what has so far been elusive to the power trader:
an easy-to-use, fully Web-based trading floor that gives power traders all
the information and flexibility they need to post offers, make bids, counter
and re-counter instantaneously, until they close the deal.
Historically, power marketers have attempted to finalize deals while
juggling numerous phones and praying no one is undercutting their
transactions because they can't see a real-time picture of market pricing.
They lose precious time because they must call around to get the latest
market prices.  HoustonStreet.com eliminates that by giving power traders
instant access to current pricing fluctuations in different regional power
markets.
"The real-time environment of the Web naturally lends itself to trading
wholesale power," said Paul Messerschmidt, manager of Power Markets Services
at Energy Security Analysis, Inc. "But existing online products are
inflexible and they typically require proprietary hardware or software to
operate.  Until these issues are rectified, wholesale power trading online
will remain dormant. Houston Street Exchange is positioning itself as the
industry's wake-up call by providing a secure, reliable and flexible
platform that allows traders to trade power the same way they do today, but
more efficiently."
HoustonStreet.com enables traders to make deals based on the product and
term of their choice, providing them the flexibility to buy and sell the
same way they do now, only utilizing a much more efficient and easy-to-use
medium-the Internet.
"The leadership of Houston Street Exchange has a vision for changing the
power marketing industry" said Alan Herrick, senior vice president at
Sapient Corporation (NASDAQ: SAPE) the e-services consultancy that helped
create HoustonStreet.com. "They understand the importance of first-mover
advantage and the need to continually provide a world-class experience for
their targeted market.  Sapient is delighted to be Houston Street's
partner."
Built with power traders in mind
Designed by power traders for power traders, HoustonStreet.com enables users
to maintain total control over each transaction, view their complete trading
history, sort offers and bids by price, term, volume and delivery point, and
trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year using an online service that ensures
the security and anonymity of each transaction.
Easy to access, navigate and use, HoustonStreet.com gives traders
up-to-the-second market information, allowing them to make the best deals at
the right time without having to leave the site.  Traders are able to
customize their Web page so they can see information that may impact
decisions on trading strategy such as updated weather reports, news
headlines about the energy industry and stock prices.
HoustonStreet.com provides users with the ability to enter their own
information regarding trading agreements and credit status without betraying
the anonymity of other parties. Knowing whether an enabling agreement is in
place and credit issues have been resolved beforehand gives a power marketer
a tremendous advantage in making split-second decisions.
Because of its ease of use and real-time environment, HoustonStreet.com will
allow power traders to make more transactions and become more efficient.
HoustonStreet.com will initially cover the Northeast regions (NEPOOL, PJM,
NY) and expects to roll out the remaining trading regions of the country
over the next several months.
"Wholesale power trading in the United States has grown by about 900 percent
since 1996. In 1998, more than 3.0 billion megawatt hours were traded, with
virtually all of it done over the telephone," said Frank Getman, Houston
Street Exchange's president and CEO. "We are redefining how power is traded
in the wholesale market, making it much more efficient and easy for power
marketers to buy and sell electricity. HoustonStreet.com represents a
powerful convergence of two major trends: growth of business-to-business
e-commerce and deregulation of the electric power industry."

developed the first Web portal for trading wholesale electric power.

marketers to trade power faster, more efficiently and more easily than they
do today.  Launched June 28, 1999, Houston Street Exchange is headquartered
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  Houston Street Exchange is a wholly owned
subsidiary of BayCorp Holdings, Ltd., (AMEX: MWH). For more information,

This press release contains forward-looking statements. There are a number
of important factors that could cause these forward-looking statements to be
materially inaccurate. These factors include, without limitation, that (i)
power traders may be unwilling or unable to use Internet-based power trading
systems, including HoustonStreet.com, (ii) HoustonStreet.com may not be able
to operate profitably, (iii) technological or systems outages could occur
and (iv) competitors with greater financial, marketing or other resources
could emerge. HoustonStreet.com is a registered service mark of Houston

Any thoughts, recommendations?

Any news on us getting Enron On-Line?  My understanding is the attorneys need
to file with FERC for approval.  However, the bigger question is whether Enron
will allows us to file with FERC and that it won't be counter productive with
the corporate strategy for PGE.

Obviously, we're anxious to start trading on-line so let me know if you have
questions.  Thanks.

This is one I did for steel.  It should probably be beefed up to include

We think the HoustonStreet disclaimer is not just overkill but entirely 
unnecessary.  And I plan to remind all of you of this the next time you claim 
the Enron lawyers are too conservative!

Elena Kapralova

Rahil,

According to Clifford Chance, our European Legal Advisor, this disclaimer 
must be driven by regulatory and investment issues in US, i.e. SEC 
requirements. 
In Europe, the paragraph like this would not be necessary in the ress 
release, but as our press release will be issued in US, it may need further 
investigation with US lawyers.... 

Rahil Jafry
29/06/99 11:10
Pls. note the disclaimer at the end of the message (highlighted in red).
Justin/Gary, is there a specific legal or PR related reason for this?
Would we have to make similar disclaimers in our press release?  Gary and I
are working on draft press releases currently and will forward those for
your approval soon.

Trading Megawatts On the Web: Houston Street Exchange
Launches First Fully Web-Based Trading Floor and Portal for
the Electric Power Industry

Business Wire - June 28, 1999 08:32
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 28, 1999-- HoustonStreet.com alters
power trading
landscape by increasing the efficiency of how power is bought and sold
Electric power. It's quickly becoming one of the world's largest traded
commodities, yet it's one of the last to be bought and sold over the
Internet. But that's about to change today when Houston Street Exchange
introduces HoustonStreet.com, a new online electric power trading floor that
allows power traders to buy and sell electricity faster and better than
before.
Houston Street Exchange hopes to do for the power industry what E
rade did for the stock market: turn the industry upside down by bringing
together buyers and sellers in a real-time, efficient online format. This
will shift the control of the $70 billion wholesale power market in the
United States by putting it directly into the hands of power marketers,
utilities and other traders that are entering the increasingly deregulated
energy market. HoustonStreet.com serves as a portal for power traders,
providing critical information regarding weather, energy news, stocks and
other direct links necessary for trading electricity. HoustonStreet.com is
pioneering the emerging business-to-business e-commerce power trading
market.
Lights out for phones, static Web sites
HoustonStreet.com delivers what has so far been elusive to the power trader:
an easy-to-use, fully Web-based trading floor that gives power traders all
the information and flexibility they need to post offers, make bids, counter
and re-counter instantaneously, until they close the deal.
Historically, power marketers have attempted to finalize deals while
juggling numerous phones and praying no one is undercutting their
transactions because they can't see a real-time picture of market pricing.
They lose precious time because they must call around to get the latest
market prices.  HoustonStreet.com eliminates that by giving power traders
instant access to current pricing fluctuations in different regional power
markets.
"The real-time environment of the Web naturally lends itself to trading
wholesale power," said Paul Messerschmidt, manager of Power Markets Services
at Energy Security Analysis, Inc. "But existing online products are
inflexible and they typically require proprietary hardware or software to
operate.  Until these issues are rectified, wholesale power trading online
will remain dormant. Houston Street Exchange is positioning itself as the
industry's wake-up call by providing a secure, reliable and flexible
platform that allows traders to trade power the same way they do today, but
more efficiently."
HoustonStreet.com enables traders to make deals based on the product and
term of their choice, providing them the flexibility to buy and sell the
same way they do now, only utilizing a much more efficient and easy-to-use
medium-the Internet.
"The leadership of Houston Street Exchange has a vision for changing the
power marketing industry" said Alan Herrick, senior vice president at
Sapient Corporation (NASDAQ: SAPE) the e-services consultancy that helped
create HoustonStreet.com. "They understand the importance of first-mover
advantage and the need to continually provide a world-class experience for
their targeted market.  Sapient is delighted to be Houston Street's
partner."
Built with power traders in mind
Designed by power traders for power traders, HoustonStreet.com enables users
to maintain total control over each transaction, view their complete trading
history, sort offers and bids by price, term, volume and delivery point, and
trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year using an online service that ensures
the security and anonymity of each transaction.
Easy to access, navigate and use, HoustonStreet.com gives traders
up-to-the-second market information, allowing them to make the best deals at
the right time without having to leave the site.  Traders are able to
customize their Web page so they can see information that may impact
decisions on trading strategy such as updated weather reports, news
headlines about the energy industry and stock prices.
HoustonStreet.com provides users with the ability to enter their own
information regarding trading agreements and credit status without betraying
the anonymity of other parties. Knowing whether an enabling agreement is in
place and credit issues have been resolved beforehand gives a power marketer
a tremendous advantage in making split-second decisions.
Because of its ease of use and real-time environment, HoustonStreet.com will
allow power traders to make more transactions and become more efficient.
HoustonStreet.com will initially cover the Northeast regions (NEPOOL, PJM,
NY) and expects to roll out the remaining trading regions of the country
over the next several months.
"Wholesale power trading in the United States has grown by about 900 percent
since 1996. In 1998, more than 3.0 billion megawatt hours were traded, with
virtually all of it done over the telephone," said Frank Getman, Houston
Street Exchange's president and CEO. "We are redefining how power is traded
in the wholesale market, making it much more efficient and easy for power
marketers to buy and sell electricity. HoustonStreet.com represents a
powerful convergence of two major trends: growth of business-to-business
e-commerce and deregulation of the electric power industry."

of important factors that could cause these forward-looking statements to be
materially inaccurate. These factors include, without limitation, that (i)
power traders may be unwilling or unable to use Internet-based power trading

to operate profitably, (iii) technological or systems outages could occur
and (iv) competitors with greater financial, marketing or other resources
could emerge. HoustonStreet.com is a registered service mark of Houston

Mark,
I am taking Thursday off for my son's birthday.  I know it is late notice but 
I would also like to take Friday off since my children have spring break this 
week.  I do not think anyone else is off on Friday.   It it is ok with you I 
will email the group.
Thanks,
Brent

I think this is probably OK.  You should probably just check with Samantha & 
Tana to make sure they aren't planning something then.  Since it is Good 
Friday, it might be a little slower than usual.

	Stephanie Panus@ENRON
	03/12/2001 08:17 AM
		 
I would like to take off April 9 - 13.  Although its not on the calendar, I 
know Susan is scheduled to be off that Fri, April 13.  I can come in on that 
Friday if need be.  Just wanted to check with you first.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Greg:

It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.  There is nowhere else on 
the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical 
Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and 
calls.  So far there have not been any collars, straddles, etc. offered.

On the second change, it looked to me like the preceding sentence already 
covers the treatment of holidays:  

...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or 
for Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, at the end of the day on the 
preceding business day)...

which makes the deleted language redundant.

	Greg Johnston
	03/12/2001 11:30 AM
		
Melba, I have reviewed the proposed changes and I do not believe that they 
should be made.  The change to the calculation of the Cash Settlement Amount 
to specify it is the Strike Price minus the Index doesn't work unless the 
option is a put.  We want this long description to work for all options 
(puts, calls, collars, etc.) and for each of those the calculation of the 
Cash Settlement Amount is different.  That is the reason that we originally 
put in the generic language that the Cash Settlement Amount is "the greater 
of zero or the amount calculated as set forth on the Website", such that the 
actual calculation mechanism for the Cash Settlement Amount will be set forth 
in each specific product.  Therefore, I would suggest we change it back to 
the original wording.

On the second change, I know that the wording that was removed is important 
to our traders.  If the description is silent on holiday pricing (which will 
be the case if we make the suggested change), I am not sure as to what the 
default is.  We need to make sure that the default where the pricing for 
holidays is not specified is exactly the same as the wording removed, 
otherwise the wording removed needs to be put back in.  I am also not clear 
on why we would remove the wording in the first place and create any 
uncertainty as to holiday pricing.

Thanks
Greg

Greg,

Attached please find the language for the Option products.  I need final 
approval from you. Changes were suggested by Mark Taylor.

Thansk,

Melba

napcameback.com

If they can figure out a way to do it, more power to them - but there are 
only just so many characters available in the short description line.  

	Greg Johnston
	03/12/2001 02:18 PM
		
Mark, you are right on the second point.  I think we are probably okay 
there.  I understand from our option traders that they intend to set the 
products themselves up on EOL to address the different calculations in the 
products themselves rather than coming up with different long descriptions 
for each.  Does that make any sense or should we be setting up separate long 
descriptions for each of the types of options they want to offer?

Greg:

It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.  There is nowhere else on 
the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical 
Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and 
calls.  So far there have not been any collars, straddles, etc. offered.

On the second change, it looked to me like the preceding sentence already 
covers the treatment of holidays:  

...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or 
for Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, at the end of the day on the 
preceding business day)...

which makes the deleted language redundant.

Melba, I have reviewed the proposed changes and I do not believe that they 
should be made.  The change to the calculation of the Cash Settlement Amount 
to specify it is the Strike Price minus the Index doesn't work unless the 
option is a put.  We want this long description to work for all options 
(puts, calls, collars, etc.) and for each of those the calculation of the 
Cash Settlement Amount is different.  That is the reason that we originally 
put in the generic language that the Cash Settlement Amount is "the greater 
of zero or the amount calculated as set forth on the Website", such that the 
actual calculation mechanism for the Cash Settlement Amount will be set forth 
in each specific product.  Therefore, I would suggest we change it back to 
the original wording.

On the second change, I know that the wording that was removed is important 
to our traders.  If the description is silent on holiday pricing (which will 
be the case if we make the suggested change), I am not sure as to what the 
default is.  We need to make sure that the default where the pricing for 
holidays is not specified is exactly the same as the wording removed, 
otherwise the wording removed needs to be put back in.  I am also not clear 
on why we would remove the wording in the first place and create any 
uncertainty as to holiday pricing.

Thanks
Greg

Greg,

Attached please find the language for the Option products.  I need final 
approval from you. Changes were suggested by Mark Taylor.

After our last discussion from Friday I thought I would outline the next 
Steps as I see them:

? Establish a corporate entity as a sub of Enron Corp. to conduct business 
under.
? Develop a consulting contract (Sample sent to you by Cassandra Schultz)
? Develop a confidentiality agreement from sample provided.
? Price Professional Liability Insurance based on contract provided.
? Hold off customers until said items are in place.

Thanks for your note - here is the form.  I think we should be able to find 
someone internally so let's at least try that first.

I have canceled my earlier plans so I have a lot of flexibility now.  If my 
preference enters into the equation, I would say 2 or 6 August would be 
perfect (I could tack a holiday on to one end or the other) but I recognize 
that may be too late.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

I guess it looks OK to me.  I'm surprised that they will have the ability to 
identify their own company as a counterparty.  Don't we limit the companies 
they can designate to those already signed up to trade on EnronOnline?  

	David Forster@ENRON

Mark,

There is a new message to add to the set you previously reviewed, covering 
the case where a broker tries to transact when identifying their own company 
as the counterparty:

Failure Reason: Cannot Complete Transaction to Broker Company
Text Body: The requested Transaction has not completed as the Counterparty 
identified for the transaction attempt is your own company.  For further 
information or to request a change in status, please contact us.

I have passed this text along for incorporation (we have very tight timelines 
as we are hoping to go live tomorrow night).

If you have any significant concerns about the above, let me know so we can 
change it.

Thanks,

Dave

has reviewed and approved the language for use on his product.  I will be 
setting this product up for testing once I receive word back from you.

Thank you.
Kevin

Shari Stack has resigned but Marcus Nettelton has been appointed to take over 
from the physical power side.  I'll sit down with him today and get him up to 
speed.

Do you know anything about this ? Do you think we will be in shape to lanuch 
these on Monday ?

We should have the first one out Monday if we can get legal to sign off. 
Apparently the person handling long descriptions for physical products quit 
and we have no replacement to look at the descriptions.

Savita

Where are we on this ?

I think the "sm" is their attempt to designate "enymex" as a service mark.

I tend to agree with you, but Nora Dobin is the lawyer who knows the most 
about the DealBench system - you should probably check with her.

Certain of my commercial folks have asked if they are able to access 
Dealbench which requires a point and click acceptance of the site access 
agreement.  As dealbench is an Enron site I think it is okay for us to agree 
and access the site; however, I wanted to know if you know of anything 
unusual about the site or access thereto.

I have the feeling that Koch finally decided to consolidate their financial 
trading with us into Koch Energy Trading.  They recently did a trade with our 
coal desk between ECT and Koch Carbon Inc.  Do we have a contact in legal (or 
elsewhere) at Koch we should call to see if they are willing to use Koch 
Energy Trading?

Looks good to me.

Hi Tana -

We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron 
I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to 
date:

1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary

2. Certificate of Secretary

3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
the part starting from RESOLVED ..)

Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your 
help and guidance whether I have done the above correctly.  If there is 
anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.

Many thanks
Angie

I will be on vacation from Monday the 19th through Monday the 26th (returning 
to the office on Tuesday the 27th).  My cell phone and pager will not work 
either at sea or in the countries I will be visiting.  I can be reached via 
Maritime Communications Network at (877)225-7447 - you will need to give my 
name and the name of the ship - Celebration.  Since the rates are around $10 
per minute, I don't plan to check my voicemail as often as usual but will 
call in when in port.

I don't know anything about the Daishowa transaction but have to wonder why 
this information could be relevant to much of anything not directly related 
to EnronOnline.  To the extent we can't avoid disclosing it, I would think 
that the traders in Calgary will know how many of them trade using the 
system.  If that doesn't work I would try Savita Puthigai (x31787) or David 
Forster (x31861) on the EnronOnline team.

	Peter Keohane
	03/16/2001 11:36 AM
		
Chris, I think Mark is the person to ask, or Mark can refer you to the right 
commercial person.  I assume Investment Canada wants to know how many traders 
in Canada trade on EOL?  I also assume that this might in fact be a 
confidential matter that should not be disclosed and which should be 
irreleveant to an ICA application for the Daishowa transaction.  In any 
event, why is del Vecchio not dealing with this?

I have been asked to confirm this as it will form part of the Daishowa 
acquition Investment Canada Act filing.  I am advised that the filing will be 
confidential so I do not think it should be an issue.  Do you take any issue 
with this?  And if not, do you know who would know the answer?

ps - I lost all of my voice mails the other day and I think there was one

Mark,

I have attached two word documents for your review, both of which contain the 
two long descriptions.  The document with filename TAS Descriptions most 
likely will be two new product types.  The other document (Nymex-GC Spreads) 
shows the long descriptions for the existing product type US HeatOil2 Fin 
Spread and US UNL Fin Spread.  We will create a new index for each of these 
product types that will be the Nymex vs Gulf Coast prices for the commodity.  
Savita has reviewed each of these documents and her only concern is how we 
capture the "Trade Date" for the TAS products.  These products have been 
requested by Larry Gagliardi, Phil Clifford, and John Wilson.  Please let me 
know your thoughts.

Thank you.

Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions:
Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest?  
If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there 
- in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the 
customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.

	Peter Keohane
	04/02/2001 07:02 PM
		 
Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash 
collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an 
"instrument" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property 
Security Act, and an "instrument" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties 
were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could 
rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate 
further?  Peter.

Yes - Thanks!

Thanks for the message back - I'll see you Friday!

Gentlemen -- 

The background on this message from Greg relates to his potential involvement 
in an advisory board for Internet Week magazine.  Essentially, this means 
that Greg would attend a couple of meetings per year and participate in a 
handful of telephone conversations all aimed at helping the editors at 
InternetWeek calibrate themselves in terms of what's important and what's not 
in the technology world.  Here are the advantages I see:

Greg gets to work with several high-level CTO's and technology CEO's who also 
participate on the board.  This is good exposure for our plans to provide IT 
services as a business.
Good exposure in terms of IT recruiting.  The more high-profile places we 
are, the better.
Good media relations and the potential for us to track editorial thought in 
the technology world.

Philippe had originally planned to do it, but I think we're concluding that 
it's a perfect place for Greg to be as part of his efforts to put new 
origination activities in motion.  

From my PR perch, I see no conflicts but Greg is right to suggest that we run 
it by you first.  Ok with you?

Mark,

I have attached new audio and new slides of Jeff Skilling's Enron Overview 
presentation to be reviewed by Legal before being posted on the EnronOnline 
site.  We would like to post this new presentation as soon as possible 
because the existing one is rather dated (it was done last September).

 <--- This is a Windows Media Player file  

The existing presentation (if you'd like to see it for comparison) is at 
http://www.enrononline.com/docs/marketing/Markets/ - click on Presentations / 
Enron Overview in the left-hand navigation.

This is Skilling's "standard" presentation, so there is nothing in it which 
has not already been presented publicly before.

Please let me know if these files have your approval for the EnronOnline 
site, or contact me if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks,

Here's a draft of the bullet points you requested:

I found this on a sailing magazine web page:

An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick 
O'Brian to my attention, claiming him to be the finest living author writing 
in the English language. Being an avid reader who had consumed about 
everything including, of course, all of Forster's Hornblower books, I had my 
doubts. But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen 
O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation 
and awe, I wholeheartedly concurred. After a second reading of the entire 
series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt 
compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful, 
life-enriching experience he had given me. Since O'Brian obviously loved the 
sea, it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight's cruse aboard my 
Perini ketch, the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea, for himself and his friends 
without any interfering presence from myself. 

I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O'Brian would be offended by receiving 
such a letter and her interesting reply was, "I get about 20,000 letters per 
year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do 
anything for me - he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent 
him from accepting." So I wrote via his publisher, having literally no idea 
where in the world he lived, and after some forwarding delay I received his 
handwritten reply, in his fine and precise penmanship, saying "I accept your 
kind offer with perhaps obscene haste."
As Mr. O'Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 1995 
that included San Francisco, I invited him to dinner the week of his visit 
and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall. His 
host was the poet laureate of America (Robert Haas). I was both charmed and 
alarmed when introduced to O'Brian's lightening quick wit and rather acerbic 
manner. 

The following evening he and his wife, Mary, came to my house in Belvedere 
for a 'literary' dinner with admirers and one or two other authors. Mr. 
O'Brian was utterly charming, if perhaps a little aloof. He took tremendous 
interest in an Admiralty Board (dockyard) model I have of an English First 
Rater of 1702. He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented 
my own knowledge. After the other guests departed, we settled into a series 
of brandies by the fire and I discovered: 1) his capacity for serious 
drinking greatly exceeded my own; 2) his reserve only eased very slightly in 
the presence of this unknown American (me) and; 3) his knowledge of the 
practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil.

After a half liter of cognac had vanished (and we were still calling each 
other Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Perkins), I produced a chart of the Mediterranean 
and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise. 

I had learned that the O'Brians' home was in Collioure, a village on the 
Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border, in Basque 
country. The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby, where Andromeda could pick 
all of them up. O'Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily, a 
stop in Greece, dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour 
of the Balearic islands. I was stunned! How, I wondered, could this old salt 
possibly comprehend a tour of over 3,000 nautical miles with numerous port 
calls, in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots? 

As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a 
desire to drop the hook in Naples, Capri and Tangiers as well. While I could 
not reconcile this plan with reality, I assumed it was the wine in control 
and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening's end 
that he had a major non-negotiable condition to accepting my offer; namely 
that I personally would join him, Mary and their guests aboard my yacht. 
?
In May 1995, as the departure date appoached, I had a rough time getting 
Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up. 
Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions, I have been pasted and this was 
one of the worst. Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all 
telecommunication as well, but after a real dusting we made it and O'Brian 
and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and 
charming home. He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes, 
pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar. I was fascinated by his 
office, where the books were written. It was lined floor to ceiling with 
reference works on an array of subjects (botany, geography, zoology, 
medicine, etc.) in several languages, but not a single volume dated later 
than 1820. He was literally immersed in the period of his work. 

The following morning we were joined by his close friend, the scholar (and 
foremost authority on Peeps) Richard Ollard, his publisher Stuart Proffit and 
his agent Vivien Green. We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit 
all the Balearic islands and O'Brian, somewhat wistfully, asked if an 
additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible? Told it was not, he 
boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver, 
short-changing him on his yachting holiday.

Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind, 
the sailing was marvelous and O'Brian was delighted. I introduced him to the 
helm, but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and 
frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to 
suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth 
were fanciful. He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like 
Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a 
day. However, he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of 
seasickness. Mary, quiet, kind, interesting and interested, was wonderful to 
have aboard. However, she was very frail. They were both nearly 80 and I 
constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship's motion, but 
thankfully this never occurred. 

Before dinner O'Brian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink 
called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with 
relish. All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the 
center of the talk and controlled its direction totally. I found the level of 
sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had 
ever experienced, and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I 
was left far behind. My MIT engineer's degree had, alas, not prepared me for 
cultivated discourse at such a level. It was literally exhausting, but a 
marvel to follow. 

The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca. 
O'Brian suggested that we sail (sail, not motor) into the long narrow channel 
leading to the port of Mahon, the location of the first meeting between 
Aubrey and Maturin. This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromeda's size, 
but I carried it off, happily, without mishap. We had an interesting 
afternoon ashore with O'Brian showing us about the old city with intense 
enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan, the local tongue. 
That evening, while at dinner back aboard the yacht, he suggested for the 
first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me.

And so our cruise continued, with Patrick showing keen interest in 
everything; we fished with some success; we sailed every day; we visited the 
port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor 
on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands 
of sea birds. Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character 
Stephen Maturin, who is clearly modeled on Patrick's physique and personality.
?
One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which 
led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal. It started with Patrick 
asking me if I had heard of a place, Indiana, and a school, the University of 
Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible? The University's 
English department had purchased (and not yet paid for) two or three of 
Patrick's manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on O'Brian which 
Patrick found intensely offensive. Patrick then mentioned that he was 
destroying all of his diaries, his journals and all of his correspondence so 
that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels. 

Richard Ollard was aghast, and Ms. Green was very upset with this quite 
startling revelation. Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and 
reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picasso's 
letters when he had written a well-received biography of the artist. 

Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him, but that he, 
Patrick, could not rely upon the goodwill of "some post-doctoral American 
fool." So the tension-filled discussion continued. The analogy of an artist 
framing his painting was raised; it was then complete and should not require 
either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist's frame 
of mind at the time of creation. 

Now, after Patrick's death, we understand some of his thinking. He was his 
own construct, born Patrick Russ, English not Irish, not university educated, 
not a sailor, a father who abandoned his family, and altogether a piece of 
his own fiction. But, that night aboard Andromeda, only Mary knew the truth 
and understood his deep motives.

The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine 
Mediterranean weather. While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in 
light wind, with our centerboard keel raised and guided by - as it turned out 
- an inaccurate Spanish chart, we decided to sail between the coast and a 
small island, and we ran firmly aground in shallow water. In the Med one 
can't simply wait for a higher tide, so we emptied all our fresh water tanks 
and tried to back off. No luck. I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk 
with compressed air, over ten tons. Still no luck. Finally, we tied a long 
hawser to a rock astern and, using our anchor windlass to bar-tight tension, 
we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster. 
Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations. He nearly believed, 
I thought, that we had arranged the event for his entertainment. 

One morning at breakfast, after our friendship had become more firmly 
established, Patrick said, "Tom, I wish to ask you an embarrassing question 
which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern 
world. What is software?" My answer, "The piano is the hardware and the sheet 
music is the software," satisfied him and upon reflection, myself as well.

Every afternoon between two and five, Patrick retired to my on-board office 
to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral, then in progress. He borrowed the 
yacht's charts of France, particularly the area around Brest, to incorporate 
detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book. Very much to 
Mary's surprise he showed me each day's progress. She said that he had never 
shared his work with anyone before completion. Later, Patrick sent me the 
original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I 
treasure.

Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business 
required that all of Patrick's guests and I depart. He and Mary continued on 
to Ibiza with the yacht's crew for three further days, mostly to study that 
island's renowned bird colonies. Then they sailed, uneventfully, back to Port 
Vendres.

My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year. 
We corresponded. He and Mary stayed in my home. They were aboard my schooner 
Mariette. We met at his club, Brooks, in London. He was a genius and his 
books remain a towering, towering achievement. I miss him greatly.

Bill -

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie    

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Thanks Doc - sounds like fun - see you Saturday!

Paul -

Sorry for the delay.  I see no problems with this in the current format.  
There might be an issue if the description of the product included the word 
COMEX or any other trademark of the exchange.  I'm not too concerned about 
the presence of "COMEX" in the long description since presumably that will 
not appear on Reuters.

Hi Mark - I see Mark Greenberg is away until tomorrow , so would you be able 
to help us out with this one? Just need to make sure we're okay to feed our 
physical metals prices to Reuters.   Specifically, can you confirm we don't 
have any agreements in place with NYMEX and/or COMEX which would restrict us 
from doing so (specifically the same live bids/offers posted on 
EnronOnline)?  The only reference to 'COMEX' in these products is in the long 
description (see below).   

Thanks,

Hi Mark - Justin suggested I contact you to see if there would be any issues 
with us feeding our live EOL COMEX physical metals quotes to Reuters (as part 
of our new deal with them to feed them various live bids/offers for various 
markets).  Our sense is that this is fine, but we want to be sure.    

Example Products (both Short and Long Description would be viewable on the 
customer's Reuters terminal):

Product Short Description    Product ID
US Cu Phy Hi-Grd Whse  May 01  36916
US Cu Phy Hi-Grd Whse  Jul01  45368

Sample Long Description (references to COMEX) 

Q1:  Do we have any restrictions on us that would preclude us from doing 
feeding these 'COMEX' quotes to Reuters? (e.g. legal agreement with NYMEX / 
COMEX in place ?)
We are hopeful that no such restrictions exist but want to make sure before 
proceeding further.   

Q2:  Are you aware of any other restrictions that would restrict us from 
feeding quotes for any of our other physical metals products to Reuters?   
(Unfortunately, we cannot post our financial LME quotes to Reuters as this 
would violate LME rules, hence our desire to at least feed our Physical 
quotes).

Sorry for the short notice but could you get back to me today on this?  We 
are trying to finalize today the list of metals products which we can include 
in the feed.   
Many thanks,

Just spoke with David Lilley and he is onside for us to post the 2 physical 
US Cu products listed below (36916 and 45368), and if possible, the following 
other Asian (Shanghai and Singapore) products as well:

41457
41465
41467
41469
41459

444513

He is also keen to add European copper soon , but needs to work on tightening 
the spreads on these products first so would like to hold off just now.

Imelda/Julie - can you look at mapping these if there are no other issues? 
One possible issue is that the long description for the 2 US Cu's may still 
contain the reference to 'COMEX' .  Apparently legal had concerns with this , 
so they were planning to change this to 'CX' or similar.

Hi David - wanted to check with you to see if you would be okay with us 
feeding live bids/offers to Reuters for the COMEX products shown below.   
Originally, when I met with Joe Gold some weeks ago, we had intended to feed 
many of our LME prices to Reuters, but due to the LME member rules 
restricting us, we were precluded from doing so.  

As such, we are hoping that we could at least feed the live quotes we have in 
place for the 2 physical COMEX products (and , if possible , the financial 
COMEX lookalike).  As part of our deal with Reuters, both we and Reuters are 
very keen to feed some quotes for metals products. Also, if there are any 
other non-LME restricted physical products you know of, we may be interested 
in feeding these as well.

Could we have a quick chat about this before the end of today ?  

Many thanks,

Good Afternoon,

The spring Monmouth College Board of Trustees meeting is just around the
corner and we are in the process of scheduling meals and reserving hotel
rooms.  The meeting packets are on their way to you by mail today, but
thought I would try electronic mail instead of the standard return card for
inquiring about your room reservations and dinner selections.

If you are planning to attend the meeting please let me know by return email
or by phone (309) 457-2127, and answer the following:

Hotel rooms are on hold for April 19 and 20.  Do you need a room reserved at
the Hawthorn Inn for the 19th and/or the 20th of April,  and for how many
people?  (If you have responded to the Development Office for the 19th, I
have received that information.)

Menu selections for Friday's dinner are:

1. Herb Crusted Dijon Lamb
2. Roasted Duck Breast
3. Mushroom Ravioli with Roasted Pepper Coulis (no cheese or cream in/on
this selection)

Please select Option 1,2 or 3.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,
Deborah

That's probably OK - just a little further into the gray.  The main concern 
is that we not be "marketing" the product with reference to the exchange - in 
our view using the exchange in the name of the product would be a problem but 
references to the exchange may be acceptable in the product description - an 
example of what would not work would be describing the product as a "COMEX 
lookalike" or something similar.

Thanks Mark - my understanding however is that the long description with the 
reference to COMEX will be viewable by Reuters users so does this change your 
view or would we still be okay, given that the reference to COMEX is quite 
benign (i.e. we have similar references in our long descriptions for IPE, 
Platts etc.)? 

Bill -

Sorry for the delay -- I was out of town and believe it or not Enron doesn't 
have a local access number to its computer system in Monmouth, IL so I just 
got your message this morning.

Don't worry about sailing skills.  Among the rest of us we have that pretty 
well covered.  We may be a bit rusty but I'll bet we can keep the boat moving 
in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any 
serious damage.  We're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in 
the world to sail around for a few days.  Navigation is easy (you can always 
see where you're going), the waters are protected (no big waves) and the wind 
consistent and not too strong (so the boat will move but not be hard to 
handle).  The skills you mentioned (sitting, drinking & socializing) are in 
fact the critical skills for a trip like this.  We sure don't want anyone on 
board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas!

If you want a sneak preview, try The Moorings website -- www.moorings.com.  
Under "Destinations" we're going to the British Virgin Islands.  Under 
"Charter Fleet" we'll be on a Moorings 463.

Since you have your tickets, please send me your flight arrival information.  
I need to pass that along to The Moorings so they will pick you up at the 
airport.  About the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food 
and drinks.  Amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so Linda & I will 
take care of most of that.  Any particular beverage requests?  Beer, wine, 
liquor, sodas, juices, mixers?  

And finally, just a bit if extra info:

1.  Your cell phones will not work in the BVI.  We will have a local cell 
phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there.  If you need 
to leave a contact number with someone, give them the Moorings' number in 
Tortola (284)494-2332.  They'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if 
a call comes in.

2.  A lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for 
renting moorings for the night (much easier than anchoring - Amanda can 
explain), meals out, departure taxes, incidentals and whatever but there 
aren't going to be lots of ATM's everywhere so you should bring what you 
think you'll need.  US Dollars are the currency.

3.  You will need your passport but there are no visa requirements.

4.  Use soft-sided luggage (easier to stow  on the boat) and try to carry 
everything on -- if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later.  

That's about all I can think of right now.  Feel free to ask any other 
questions.  I'm starting to get excited now too.  It's hard to believe it's 
less than 3 weeks away!

hesitant to confirm in writing that he knows how to sail.

Mark --

Amanda and I have the following flight plans:

Friday May 11

Leave Washington  AA Flight 771 7:00 a.m.
Arrive San Juan 10:41 a.m.
Leave San Juan AA Flight 5682 1:04 p.m.
Arrive Tortola Beef Island 1:47 p.m.

Our departures are as follows:

Bill -- Tuesday May 15

2:32 p.m. AA Flight 5541 from Tortola to San Juan

Amanda -- Thursday May 17

2:32 p.m. AA Flight 5541 from Tortola to San Juan

No, the ETA says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs 
trades in the relevant commodities.  In fact, we used that language to 
mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms 
when they first signed up for EnronOnline.  To the extent we want to 
eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their 
agreement.  

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms 
for GTC-governed  transactions without asking the customer first.  Whether or 
not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will 
leave to others.  Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you 
might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up 
for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally 
available......

	Andy Zipper/ENRON@enronXgate
	04/25/2001 08:41 AM
		 
Question:

Does the ETA trump any language in an existing ISDA regarding the signed 
confirm being the governing doc for a trade ?
Leslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss 
the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on 
EnronOnline.  Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of 
confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.  This 
elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by 
counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  

Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution 
of a transaction (ease of availability, type of   record available, retention 
schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?)

        Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for 
elimination of confirmations - large number of    transactions, those that 
have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot)

         Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, 
Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth   Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie 
Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on   
ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting) 

Bill,

Thanks for the info.

Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be 
somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs 
who will get you into a van or bus to the base.  It's a little harder to get 
to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get there 
until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at 5:21).

 It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.  Mind sending 
yours along?

Mark

Yes, silly me.  But just so there's some hope that Bill makes his flight 
back, we should plan on being in the general vicinity of Tortola on the day 
of his flight.

It turns out I need everybody's birthday and address.  I assume you're still 
at 200 W 86th but don't know your birthday.

Further information about the firm, a list of the Partners and their 
professional qualifications will be provided upon request.

I'm pretty sure this is going in across the board for US deals.  If you guys 
want to, I have no objection.  We came up with some language to insert into 
the first paragraph of the confirm indicating that it is subject to the GTC 
and incorporating it by reference.  Bob Bowen has the final version of the 
language (I think it varied slightly between various commodities).

Just as a 'heads up' we are also starting down the road of doing away with 
confirmations altogether for certain US EnronOnline transactions.  Maybe we 
should chat about that and I can give you all the details.  It's going to be 
a lengthy and painful process.

	Greg Johnston
	04/25/2001 09:51 AM
		 
Mark, I wanted to get your thoughts on whether ECC can implement this online 
GTC policy for its financial and physical transaction completed through EOL.  
I would suspect that, if ENA has passed on this, it should be okay for ECC to 
follow suit.  Are you implementing this policy just on the financial 
transactions or across the board?

Let me know.

Thanks
Greg
Dianne Seib
04/23/2001 01:42 PM
Peter and Greg,

Attached below is more information on the subject of Online GTC's.  This will 
affect the financial transactions we confirm as ENA as we are currently using 
ENA's templates for these transactions.  Can we implement this change for our 
ECC financial transactions as well as for physical transactions?

Let me know.

Dianne
Bob Bowen
04/23/2001 12:53 PM
Good News!  We finally received approval of the language to be used for 
EnronOnline transactions 
subject to General Terms & Conditions so that we do not have to attached the 
GTC's to every 
confirmation sent.  Again, the language attached is for particular products, 
so please check with your 
respective legal groups to get their approval.

I would like to start this process next Monday, April 30, 2001.  Can everyone 
meet that deadline?  If 
this does not affect you, please reply so.

Attached is the final language (don't let the file name fool you):

Valuing dot-coms after the fall
The Internet roller coaster may rank as the market's most dramatic
upheaval over the past 20 years, but it certainly hasn't been the only
one. Remember biotech? Real estate? Leveraged buyouts? What about Japan
Incorporated? Sooner or later, investment values always revert to a
fundamental level based on cash flows. Get used to it.

Mobile portals mobilize for scale
As investors have cooled to new ventures, survival is now at the top of
the agenda for mobile portals. Whether a portal stays alive will depend on
its ability to offer accessibility, awareness, and the right services. The
rest of the struggle---rapid expansion to ensure long-term survival and,
eventually, global dominion---will come down to guts and determination.
http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1022

The innovative organization
The idea that new businesses prosper best when separated from their
corporate parents has now become conventional wisdom. Although new
ventures do need space to develop, strict separation can prevent them from
obtaining invaluable resources and rob their parents of the vitality they
can generate. The solution? A balance of partitioning and integration.

Programmers abroad: A primer on offshore software development
More and more companies are going offshore to develop and maintain their
software. The reason is simple: this approach saves time and money.
Without discipline in managing offshore relationships, however, a company
not only can squander the cost and time savings it had hoped to gain but
also may face late deliveries, escalating costs, mismatches between
expectations and deliverables, and even outright failure.

I'm not sure if you guys have seen this before or not.  Lousie seems to think 
that you are preparing the U.S. version of this.

I am not quite sure the context of this - if I were to issue a password to 
someone (because I was going to give them readonly access) they would not 
have to sign anything - the requiremetn is for a document to appear on the 
screen though when they login - a read only ETA.  how doe these fit together?

   

Justin,

I attach a revised Read Only Agreement. I understand that you will circulate
this to the appropriate people. You will see that I have already copied it
to Louise and Elena.

Kind regards.

Thanks for the credit card number - I'm sure it will come in handy some day.  
I was actually planning to pay for the Moorings portion of this as a 
graduation present.  Is that OK?

I need your birthday and address to finalize the info for the Moorings.  
Finals going OK?

Ken - 

I have a question about the interpretation of this paragraph of the 
EnronOnline Legal & Privacy Statement.  Maybe we can talk about it when we 
talk about the clearing issue.

14. In the course of your use of this website, you may provide, or Enron may 
otherwise obtain, information about you or your business activities. By using 
this website, you expressly consent to Enron (1) using this information to 
assess the function and performance of this website, to assess the needs of 
its customers, to market Enron's products and services and for the other 
purposes set out in this paragraph 14, and (2) transferring this data to 
Enron subsidiaries throughout the world for the purposes specified in (1) 
above. Any information which you provide or which Enron otherwise obtains 
will be used solely by Enron and will not be sold or made available to third 
parties, with the exception of the third parties providing data processing or 
similar services to Enron, or in connection with Enron's provision or 
marketing of products and services to you. 

Thanks for the info.  And I sure hear your --  especially re: crim pro!  On 
the evidence front, I did the same thing you did -- took it for bar purposes 
-- but I never cease to be amazed at how often it comes up in my 
non-litigator's practice.  So don't despair, it may yet be helpful.\

 I'm really looking forward to sailing too.  Just two weeks!

Attached is a brief outline of the requirements for electronic trading 
facilities for transactions in exempt commodities.  Exempt commodities are 
all commodities other than financial commodities (e.g. interest rates, 
currencies, securities) and agricultural commodities.

I'm afraid I already have plans but thanks for the invite.

We have reservations with Eric, the golf pro, on Friday afternoon at 3:00.  
He thinks 4 or 5 holes will takes us 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  We don't have to play 
just holes 1 through 5 but can pick and choose -- based to some extent on 
where other people are playing.

Saturday afternoon you have a massage appointment at the club at 2:00 with a 
manicure/pedicure to follow at 3:00.  My massage is at 2:00.  Amanda decided 
not to participate since she will need to get ready for the party.  She is 
going to try and get lunch reservations for us all at Boar's Head for 11:45.

Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he 
would be with Amanda on Saturday.

We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done with 
golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your nails 
until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq and 
Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.

Using your numbers:
1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to.
2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending 
on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund 
group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 
in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting 
certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.
3. Yes
4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a 
one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules. 

	David Forster/ENRON@enronXgate
	04/27/2001 05:18 PM
		 
OK - so based on this document:

1) Are we registered with the CFTC?
2) Are we prohibited from transacting with hedge funds ("investment company")?
3) Are the "exemption conditions" with which the facility must comply just 
the conditions listed in the document?
4) Could you clarify: Do the conditions described in the document apply to us 
now, or only if we become "regulated"?

As per our conversation, I understand that FX is subject to even less 
stringent requirements than our current commodities are. 

Thanks,

Dave

something for Fri. afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the golf

Sorry to hear you're having computer problems.  I haven't gotten a virus yet 
but I have had 2 hard drives crash and burn on me -- one at home and one at 
the office -- you definitely loose everything when that happens!  My fairly 
new work computer (the little one you saw at Christmas) started making 
strange noises a couple of weeks ago so I called in the tech support guys.  
They agreed that is sounded odd so they took everything off of my hard drive, 
replaced it with a new one and then put all of my stuff back in the new one.  
Took them a day or so but the weird noises are gone so I feel better.

I'm off to San Antonio this week for a couple of days and then leave for 
sailing on the 11th, returning on the 21st.  The last few days (18 - 21) I'll 
be staying at a place called Keswick Hall in Virginia.  I may be able to send 
that number before I leave.

Love,

Mark

I thoroughly agree about tea -- if you can reschedule your manicure the 
timing would be perfect.  And you're right about Sunday afternoon too -- I'm 
sure by then we'll be ready for a rest.  Do we have plans for Sunday eve.?

I love manicures but maybe tea would be more fun - If I cancel or move the 
manicure maybe we could have a sip in the lounge before we head off to the 
BBQ - I don't think we have to be the first ones at the BBQ.  Also, maybe tea 
will fit in on Sunday too.  It will probably be a good point in the day to 
sit down and to relax.  I'll call to see if they can reschedule the maicure.

Did the pro happen to mention anything about dress codes on the course.  Most 
courses require a shirt with a collar (a polo  - not a t shirt) and one or 
two courses in the world require golf shoes - most are fine with sneakers.

I hope you like golf.  I took a lesson at the Doral ( the partner's retreat 
was there this year) and they have a golf school there. It was a great little 
school.   I'd like to go back down for a weekend to the golf school. I don't 
think that I will ever be good at it.  But there are clearly some tricks to 
the game ( it is like sailing - all degrees and very scientific) that you can 
pick up at a golf school and its enough I think to go out with other 
beginners.   If you like golf maybe you will want to go the weekend golf 
school too ( on your way back from south america maybe).  Every resort I ever 
go to has a golf course - I feel like I am always paying an extra $50 per 
night for the golf - but never use it.  I'd like to take a few lessons so I 
can play when I am on vacation.

was there this year) and they have a golf school there. It was a great
little school.   I'd like to go back down for a weekend to the golf school.
I don't think that I will ever be good at it.  But there are clearly some
tricks to the game ( it is like sailing - all degrees and very scientific)
that you can pick up at a golf school and its enough I think to go out with
other beginners.   If you like golf maybe you will want to go the weekend
golf school too ( on your way back from south america maybe).  Every resort
I ever go to has a golf course - I feel like I am always paying an extra
$50 per night for the golf - but never use it.  I'd like to take a few
lessons so I can play when I am on vacation.

The pro understands there are only three of us 'golfing.'  Since we needed
something for Fri. afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the
golf I went ahead and made the reservation that way.

The manicure was Amanda's idea.  Never having had one, I just assumed they
dried them for you.  Would you rather have a facial?  I didn't ask about
the morning.

Do you still want to do golf without Bill?  I think I'd like to do it - the
pro will probably be happy to lose a body.

I think I will call and cancel the manicure/pedicure.  I think it is too
tight for me to hurry back to get ready with wet nalis.  You don't happen
to remember if they had any morning appointments?  I'll call.

Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he
would be with Amanda on Saturday.

We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done
with golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your
nails until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq
and Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. William (Bill) Eke, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria, Lagos
Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.

On June 6, 1997, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$75,000,000.00 (Seventy Five
Million Dollars) in my branch.  On maturity, I sent a routine notification
to
his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder
and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident.
On
further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and
all
attempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including
his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of total US$75,000,000.00 is
still
sitting in my Bank as dormant account.  No one will ever come forward to
claim
it, and according to Nigerian Law after 5 years, the money will revert to
the
ownership of the Nigeria Government if the account owner is certified dead
and
nobody comes forward to claim it.

This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for an American
who
will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly.  A bank account abroad
will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to the beneficiary/next of kin.
This
is simple all you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank
account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer
paperwork.  The money will then be paid into this account for us to share in
the
ratio 70% for me; 30% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done
by me using my position and connection in the Banks in Nigeria.  We shall
employ
the services of an attorney to draft the Will and obtain all necessary
documents
and letters of administration in your favour for the transfer.  This
transaction
is guaranteed.

If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email
address
below.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require
your
assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: billeke0@lycos.com

Thank you and regards.

Mr. William (Bill) Eke.

Bill:

I am sending you by FedEx tonight a copy of the most recent edition of the 
cruising guide to the Virgin Islands.  It's not required reading but I 
thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be 
sailing.  Please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if 
we try and go to any spots we haven't been to before and since it will have 
the most up to date information on navigation, restaurants, bars, etc. (you 
will see little hand-drawn charts of the most popular anchorages - these are 
surprisingly useful).

There's a lot of information in there.  If you want to focus on just a few, 
the places we are (in my humble and easily overridden opinion) most likely to 
visit are:

Road Town - that's where we will pick up the boat so we're pretty certain to 
be there
The Bight on Norman Island - deserted island but a floating bar/restaurant, 
good snorkeling nearby
Jost Van Dyke - we have always liked Sydney's Peace & Love in Little Harbor 
and Foxy's in Great Harbor
Sandy Cay - the classic deserted island, very small - probably just a lunch 
or quick swim stop
Cane Garden Bay - a little tricky  getting in but well worth it - the 
quintessential Caribbean beach (swath of white sand, palm trees, steel bands, 
etc.)
Trellis Bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a 
restaurant called The Last Resort
Cooper Island - nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining 
option
The Baths - wouldn't be a trip to the BVI without a stop here
Bitter End Yacht Club - probably about as far as we'd want to go

There are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on St. John but it 
is in the US Virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and 
customs in the BVI, then clearing into the US at Cruz Bay on St. John and 
then back into the BVI when we go back over there.  Kind of a lot of trouble, 
particularly since the anchorage in Cruz Bay is so crowded it's impossible to 
find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in.  We've done it 
before but my view is that with limited time it just isn't worth it.  Of 
course, we started this with the assumption that my view isn't necessarily 
controlling here and I know that Linda particularly likes the restaurant at 
Caneel Bay (fancy resort) on St. John.  So stay tuned.

We will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near Tortola (which 
probably just means not at the Bitter End or on St. John) the night before 
your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport.  One alternative is 
to stay at Trellis Bay - or right across at Marina Cay - that night and just 
dinghy you over to the dock - it's a 5 min. walk to the airport.  Or we can 
drop you anywhere else there's a phone since there are taxis that can be 
called and the island just isn't that big - I don't think it could take more 
than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other!

I put the Moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide.  They aren't that 
important unless you check bags.  Please be sure to use them if you check 
anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up 
with us some day.  I'm not sure, but it may also make it just a tad easier to 
get through BVI customs when they see those familiar tags.

Here are some BVI links if you have time to do a little surfing:

La Fogata is approx. ten minutes from the hotel by cab.   Please just let me 
know if you can attend by 10 am tomorrow so that I can expand our reservation 
appropriately.  I hope to see you tomorrow.

Since we will all be swamped trying to get out of here on time tomorrow, I 
think we should defer the group meeting.  I will be out of town on the 16th, 
so please check your calendars to see if 10:00 on the 9th will work as a 
substitute.

 ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Aare-Tessin AG (Z.AAR), the Swiss power company known as 
Atel, said
 Thursday that it has set up a company for derivatives trading. 

 Atel said it's launching the new company, derivAtel, amid the deregulation 
of Europe's electricity
 markets.

 "In this manner the market position of Atel will be strengthened," Atel said 
in a press release. 

 The company will offer derivatives to hedge volatile electricity prices. 

 Atel said it received permission for derivative trading from the Federal 
Banking Commission on July

so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs 
together.  Dress is casual.  The phone number for the restaurant is 
210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar 
(this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).  If you 
haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count

You always make me laugh.

Why don't you just pay for you.  You've been footing the bill for Amanda & 
her friends all these years; it's your turn to take a break!

By the way, I don't remember pointing out that she is spoiled - thinking it 
often enough, but not pointing it out.  Of course we both know how my tongue 
loosens and my memory locks up in direct proportion to the volume of alcohol 
consumed.....

speaking of this bucket.  I think it is lovely that you are giving Amanda a 
graduation gift but -  trust me -  should would rather have another pair of 
earrings than have a free seat for me on the boat.  I didn't even know you 
when I graduated so it is much too late to give me a graduation present.  
Won't you let me pay half ( the half of the boat that Bill and I are 
occupying)?  As you have pointed out amanda is too too spoiled.

Did anyone get you a yacht when you graduated?

The recent amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act essentially codified the

rules. I will try to find it.
Rajen Shah
15/12/1998 17:53
Telecon with Douglas Harris (AA New York):

1. The "$10m total assets" requirement technically needs to be satisfied at 
all times.

2. No clear definition of total assets but his view is that total assets on a 
US GAAP basis should be satisfactory.

3. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and on 
lends the proceeds to Affiliate 2 then the receivable from Affiliate 2 would 
qualify for the $10m total assets test.

4. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and the 
proceeds are used to fund on going trading then if due to losses total assets 
were to fall below $10m then technically LLC would need to top up total 
assets for the losses incurred.

It would appear from the above that the most effective route is to fund the 
LLC by way of an interest free loan and for the LLC to on lend to affiliates.

I have a legal question for you.  I was told recently that Carol St Clair was 
going to help support the West Trading desk on physical transactions.  Since 
she came from the financial legal group I was wondering if she would be able 
to help with financial transactions as well.  I feel there are synergies to 
having the same Enron lawyer represent us for both the EEI and ISDA.  A 
recent example of this could be the SMUD relationship.  Carol recently 
completed an amendment to the existing ISDA and now is looking at sending 
them a EEI.  The SMUD credit and legal personnel are the same so the process 
should be quite smooth.  I was interested in your thoughts on this.  You can 
reach me by phone (503-464-3810) or email.  Thanks.

NEW RULE 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018)

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the=
=20
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing=
=20
Members, the following rules shall define the respective=20
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The =01&executi=
ng=20
broker=018, as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member =
Firm=20
or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)   Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its=20
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up f=
or=20
a customer=01,s account from an executing broker, provided however, that th=
e=20

Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be=20
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice=
=20
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (=01&DK=018) a trade on=
ly if: =20
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of=
=20
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing=

ch=20
the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for=
=20
rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions o=
f=20
Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred=
=20
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and=
=20
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. =
=20
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing=20
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1) Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once=
=20
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker=01,s clerk must:

(a) confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b) accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as=20
practicable; and
(d) transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as=20
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2. Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing=
=20
broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with=
=20
the broker=01,s obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remain=
s=20
responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules.

3.  Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member =20
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order=
=20
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the=20
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g) the account number;
(h) the brokerage rate;
(i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with=
=20
the executing broker for that account; and
(j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifi=
cs=20
of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time,=
=20
and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information=
=20
shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4. Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed=20
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in=
=20
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker=01,s discret=
ion,=20

Mark, 

Further to my e-mail to you of last week on the above subject, I have now 
reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local 
Indian Counsel (Crawford Bailey & Co.) on the above topic in January 1997.  
That due diligence reveals the following:

Prior Reserve Bank of India ("RBI") approval required to do business in 
India:  If  Enron is considered to be "doing business in India" (which it 
would, for example, if we had a branch or entity there) we shall require the 
prior consent of the  RBI under Section 29 (1) (a) Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act 1973 ("FERA") e.g. to set up the branch or entity.  Please 
note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel (14th January, 
1997), Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any 
conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain 
approval from the RBI to do business in India.  This needs to be revisited as 
to the requirements.

Repatriation of proceeds / Exchange Control:  Please note that in the 
approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI, such approval would 
state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated e.g., to 
the USA, or not.  I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate 
and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it.  We also 
need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation.  

FX / Interest Rate dealings:

A. It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate 
Products for the Enron Group (i.e., an internal Treasury Desk) to trade with 
dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with 
either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the 
RBI.  

B. FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and 
would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by 
the FERA.  Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the 
general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically 
approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA.  It is not 
clear what are the exact ramifications of  dealings in contravention of FERA; 
this needs to be investigated. 

C. What are the Rules of FERA (see A above)?  It appears that the RBI 
requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are 
actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying 
transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their 
exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates, and authorised 
dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are 
firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated 
deals.   The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the 
dealer.   It appears, however, that there was a relaxation of the Rules 
shortly before the 1997 due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised 
dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to 
corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a back-to-back 
basis without seeking the approval of the RBI.  These transactions are the 
following:

1. Interest Rate Swaps.

2. Currency Swaps.

3. Coupon Swaps.

4. Purchase of Interest Rate CAPS/Collars.

5. Forward rate agreements.

 In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers 
are required to ensure that:

(i) The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying 
loan transactions.

(ii) The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the 
outstanding amount of the loan.

(iii) The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to 
maturity of the underlying loan

(iv)  The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved (a once and 
for all basis is sufficient) the relevant financial limits and the authorised 
designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions.

Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of 
underlying "loan" transactions.  Hence query, e.g., whether a simple currency 
swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual 
underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption - and if not, query how one 
obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this.  This needs to be 
investigated.  If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall 
need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a 
transaction.   

Speculative transactions are void:  Please note that transactions entered 
into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section 30 of 
the Indian Contract Act 1872.  Indian counsel opines that provided the rate 
or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or 
protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid. 

Capacity and Authority: It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that 
the transactions were covered by its objects' clause and similarly that our 
counterparties' objects' clauses covered the products in which we wish to 
deal - there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside 
their capacity.  Furthermore, in relation to authority to enter into 
transactions, it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron 
officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or 
Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties' 
documentation in this regard.  

Derivatives and Borrowings:  If we were to establish a company in India, we 
would be subject to the Companies Act 1956 in relation to limitation on the 
quantum of monies which it could borrow.   Any borrowing in excess of 
stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the 
company in general meeting.  Accordingly, in relation to derivatives' 
transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency, one 
would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by 
the members of the company in general meeting. The power to borrow itself, 
must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors. 

Collateral: It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided / 
received, for example, in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master 
Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India, would be legal, 
valid and binding, as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its 
insolvency; however, the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge, 
pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance.  The due 
diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due 
diligence consider outright transfers of collateral (e.g., under English law) 
rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral 
situated locally in India;  these issues need to be checked. 

Choice of Law and Arbitration:  It would appear that Indian entities may 
enter into agreements (e.g., ISDA Masters) governed by New York or US law and 
it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work.

Insurance business:  Indian counsel opined that interest rate/FX derivative 
transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India.

Income Tax:  Please note that if an Enron entity, or a branch of an Enron 
entity, was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake 
such business, then any income arising to the Enron entity / branch in India 
from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax.  Please 
note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA, UK and 
Singapore with India.  However, no details of rates of taxation or further 
explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in 
the opinion.

Gross-Up Clauses:  Contractual gross-up clauses re withholdings (e.g., the 
standard gross-up clause in the ISDA Master) would need to be approved by the 
RBI.  Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved. 

Close-out netting:  Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA 
Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel, the existing due 
diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator 
or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim 
unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum 
(e.g., if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a close-out against 
them in their insolvency).  This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel.

Oral Contracts:  Please note that in relation to oral contracts, whilst it is 
possible to sue upon an oral contract in India, it is not possible to take 
any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the 
permission of the RBI under section 47 of FERA.  Indian counsel does not 
state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to 
obtain. 

Mark, I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above 
before I take any further action on the above.

Kind regards

Mark

Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a 
subsidiary in India, and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the 
US any proceeds of such business, there did not appear to be any other trade 
control or other laws which would inhibit Enron's ability to do business in 
India. 

As you already know, it's that time again.  Since I am leaving on vacation 
Friday morning, please use the system to input your suggested reviewers no 
later than noon tomorrow (Thursday) so that I can approve them and get the 
process started before I leave.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

Mark

Can you please see if you can get me out of this?  I have to talk to Ken 
Raisler with Brent & Julia at 2 and with tomorrow being my last day before 
vacation it will no doubt be too hectic to do an interview.

I apologize for the title mess-up. Please find the revised schedule with the 
correct titles:

 

She's right - there are a couple of high class resorts that require long 
pants and a collared shirt but we can easily avoid those.  The first few 
years we went sailing down there I always took long pants and even a sport 
coat "just in case."  The sport coat NEVER got used.  I usually wear a pair 
of khakis on the plane since they are sometimes cold and have used them a 
couple of times down there over the years but for the most part it's a tres 
casual part of the world.

p.s.  Did you get the cruising guide I sent?

Approved.

Glad you got the  package.

I view chess as one of the incontrovertible pieces of evidence that the Peter 
Principle is in operation in my life.  I know how all the pieces move but I 
can't see more than one move ahead -- proving that I am basically an idiot 
and have advanced well beyond where I long ago should have maxed out 
professionally.  So if you want someone to use to provide nearly unlimited 
examples of how to make mistakes in playing (while nevertheless following the 
rules), I'm your man.

Yes I did.  It looks great.  We will use the luggage tags as you suggested
and will probably be able to do all carry on.  Although, if we do it will be
a first for Amanda.  See you on Friday.  Bill

P.S. Do you play chess?  I just got a travel set and was going to teach
Amanda.  I will also have my trusty bartenders guide so I can help out with
the "sailing."

p.s.  Did you get the cruising guide I sent?

Oops - I didn't notice that your first message this morning went to Linda & 
Amanda also.  I guess we'd better bring a pair of long pants.
	"Linda Hayman" <LHAYMAN@skadden.com>

That is because amanda picked The Crab Hole in Little Dix on our last trip I 
can guaranty you that I picking the Rock Resort this time!

rn, William" <McGovernW@SEC.GOV> 05/09/01 11:52AM >>>
I was thinking of not packing long pants in favor of a shorts/bathing suit
only vacation.  Do you think I will need dressier attire for a restaurant or
is it "all casual all the time" down there.  Amanda said the restaurants are
converted shacks and shorts will be fine.  I just wanted to double check.

Bill

Here is a first draft of an amendment agreement.  Please feel free to rip it 
to shreds.

Peter:

My only concerns would be:

 (1) To the extent of any overlap in customers (which seems unlikely but it's 
happened here), we would want all of the transactions to be in the same 
entity for netting and setoff purposes.
 (2)  It's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail 
financial transactions in Canada.  We are pretty restricted in that area in 
the US.  As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we 
unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada.
 (3)  If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a 
Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, 
they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron 
Canada and ENA.

Let me know if I can be of any help.

Mark (and Mark) are there any concerns with Enron Direct Canada (EDC) (the 
mass markets retail affiliate, that is soon to be a subsidiary of EES) as 
opposed to Enron Canada (as wholesale affiliate of ENA) entering into 
financial transactions?  To date EDC has been entering into physical 
transactions only for gas and power under forms that have been developed 
based upon our wholesale physical contracts, Enron Direct UK's form, and 
compliance with the local regulatory requirements for retailers.  If EDC was 
to enter into financial transactions, they would tend to be papered under 
omnibus financial GTCs with EDC (as ISDAs would likely not be marketable).  
Of course credit would need to be obtained in advance, and the transactions 
are not booked until the counterparty executes the paper.  Please let me know.

Peter.

All Delaware corporations are registered with the Secretary of State's office 
in Wilmington, Delaware.  Since that office is notoriously slow, if your 
counterparty is trying to get information on ECTRIC they might have better 
luck going through CT Corporation Systems, a company that is in the business 
of dealing with corporate information and issues which has access to the 
Delaware state records.  They have offices all over the place, including 
Wilmington.

Hope this is helpful.

Mark

   

Hello Mark:

a German counterparty asked me where in Delaware ECTRIC was incorporated. 
Obviously they want to  research the company.

Can you give me the name of the city ?

Thanks

I don't have copies of any of the FASB pronouncements.  I suggest you find 
one of the accountants who handles these things.  I don't know who that is so

In connection with my continued efforts as co-chair of the Ontario Standard 
Bilateral contract committee I am once again going to be called upon to 
debate Ontario Power Generation as to whether the Ontario market rules allow 
for physical trading (which is our position) or is a purely financial market 
(OPG's position).  
As part of their argument they are pointing to certain FASB rules that 
distinguish between physical and financial/derivative transactions.  Do any 
of you have a copy of or reference to such materials and/or commentary 
thereon.

My debate is to occur Monday so if you could get back to me as soon as 
possible it would be greatly appreciated.

Ken Raisler will be here on Monday, May 21 to conduct several training 
sessions for the weather and steel trading desks.  If you can work it into

Sorry I haven't been able to respond.  I have been swamped trying to get away 
for a vacation and in fact am leaving in the morning.  I will have to get

I was just cleaning out my e-mails (well, a few of them anyway) and ran

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals i=

Dear Mark,

Thanks for keeping us updated on Tom. I am pleased to hear that he is making 
a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the 
hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a 
convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home 
address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.

I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on 
Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him 
this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the 
Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has 
had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I 
think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how 
much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for 
the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now 
but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in 
some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden 
walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with 
some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer 
so that I can feel the benefit of it.

I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns 
from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got 
his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be 
happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and 
Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come 
she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in 
it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some 
help.

Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into 
exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking 
piling up).

At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping 
that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring 
few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down 
to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of 
cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for 
Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing 
very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might 
be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.

We will look forward  to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.

Bye for now,

Deb

Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda 
and have the following suggestions:

1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this 
one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.)
2.  German Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year 
that might also be appropriate:

Christophe's panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active 
in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions

Thanks for this memo -- definitely comforting for the vast majority of our 
swap business.  I think the additional interesting question is whether or not 
we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when 
we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting 
and joint credit support arrangements.  If we net all of our trading 
exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, 
coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be 
posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do 
we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap 
agreement?"  Would you like me to ask Emory to expand?

In an effort to get the concept off the ground here in the States, 
particularly Houston, to that of equal extent presently being experienced in 
London, we need to come up with a marketing/educational assault on the States 
market. When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted 
by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other 
than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any 
faith or could agree on a pricing index.  Fortunately, the market is starting 
to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here 
shortly.

The Baltic Exchange would like to thank its panellilsts for their 
contributions.
Names of the panellists are available from the Baltic Exchange website 
(www.balticexchange.com) and in the manual for the panellists.

When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are 
assessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 
11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the 
exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a 
total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker 
market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The 
tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.  

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact same 
concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight 
market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 
route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus 
Christi - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual 
voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (May 
11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did 
a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the 
market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 
p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,100 USD; vice versa if 
you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London 
trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that 
should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it 
pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In 
addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul 
crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the 
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time 
- contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market 
when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are 
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill 
liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a "last 
done" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC 
Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl 
market.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 
x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where 
the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most 
of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...  
This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the 
traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of 
buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 
million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, 
North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off 
loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize if this 
is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big 
ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the 
lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight 
which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x 
ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, 
or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly 
dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they 
deliver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will 
probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, 
Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.  

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) 
etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, 
a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to 
them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  Some of 
the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as 
contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. 
with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves 
p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula 
off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. 

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if 
have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash 
flows.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it 
to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping 
in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal 
with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are not 
going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that 
trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much 
more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined 
result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates 
which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as 
limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any 
supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems 
and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz 
with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast 
S.America.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once 
again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far 
in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off 
the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with 
Citibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was 
interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but 
setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn 
presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing 
would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a 
bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is 
always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals 
concluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor 
of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would be in 
his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one 
presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to 
manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was to take 
off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futures rates 
are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off 
of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, 
first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers weren't just 
owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing 
tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to get this going 
was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was 
coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with 
legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of 
Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott advises me 
that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the 
physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the 
global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow 
now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to 
pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the 
buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the 
freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a 
explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in 
London.

As per my call.

11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the 
exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a 
total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker 
market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The 
tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.  

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact same 
concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight 
market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 
route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus 
Christi - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual 
voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (May 
11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did 
a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the 
market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 
p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,100 USD; vice versa if 
you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London 
trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that 
should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it 
pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In 
addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul 
crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the 
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time 
- contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market 
when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are 
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill 
liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a "last 
done" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC 
Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl 
market.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 
x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where 
the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most 
of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...  
This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the 
traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of 
buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 
million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, 
North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off 
loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize if this 
is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big 
ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the 
lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight 
which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x 
ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, 
or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly 
dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they 
deliver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will 
probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, 
Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.  

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) 
etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, 
a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to 
them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  Some of 
the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as 
contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. 
with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves 
p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula 
off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. 

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if 
have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash 
flows.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it 
to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping 
in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal 
with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are not 
going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that 
trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much 
more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined 
result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates 
which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as 
limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any 
supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems 
and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz 
with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast 
S.America.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once 
again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far 
in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off 
the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with 
Citibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was 
interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but 
setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn 
presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing 
would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a 
bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is 
always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals 
concluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor 
of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would be in 
his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one 
presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to 
manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was to take 
off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futures rates 
are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off 
of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, 
first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers weren't just 
owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing 
tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to get this going 
was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was 
coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with 
legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of 
Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott advises me 
that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the 
physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the 
global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow 
now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to 
pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the 
buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the 
freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a 
explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in 
London.

Homer - 

The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any 
term that is longer than a month.  As far as I know, we have never had a 
product that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us 
here?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the 
second issue (deals shorter than one month):

Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction.

In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the 
payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month 
(rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a 
commercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.

If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up 
with alternative language.

Mark,

Looks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping 
products that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.

I'm a little concerned about the line: "Each calendar month during the term 
of the Transaction will be a Determination Period"...

Is it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to 
mid-month?
As in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another 
Long Description that we would have to draft for another product type?

Also, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller 
increments than one month?  
Let us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.

May be something like:
"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates"

That's my two cents,
Homer

Peter -

We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not 
been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of 
the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver 
of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled 
carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls 
generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the 
point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem.

Mark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter 
for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit's 
requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i.e. 
use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timing, 
notice addresses, etc.).  It seemed to me that the form they are using may 
have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is not a 
drafting exercise on a case by case basis.  Practically, to the extent that 
the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no substantive 
concern.  However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in commodity 
markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circumstances 
where their credit is getting "tight", I can see the lack of contractual 
compliance perhaps being problematic.  Can somebody in your group develop a 
template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron 
form, the "industrial" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please call 
Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter.

Mark,

Whether or not the mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, you should 
probably ask Scott Moncrieff or Joe King to answer that question.

I was just suggesting the possibility...  I do like the additional language 
that covers deals shorter than one month

"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction."

Perhaps we should proceed with the current Product Description and worry 
about the mid-month to mid-month description if/when we need it.

Notice No. 01-191

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:
NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

RE:
EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION 
LIMIT RULES

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has 
approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current 
position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, 
heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the 
Friday, June 15, trading session.

For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of 
those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots.

The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the 
accountability levels. These are:

   Any one month         All months
Crude oil  10,000   20,000
Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000
Heating oil  5,000   7,000
Natural gas  7,000   12,000

Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted 
by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging 
requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to 
require that the position be reduced or capped.

There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can 
be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the 
market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, 
October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for 
December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 
contracts).

These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures 
contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a 
minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract.

These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the 
COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
prior to implementation.

Mark,

I just wanted to drop you a quick note on the feedback process. I declined 
Carol's feedback form, but that in no way is intended as a reflection on her 
performance.  I just have not worked with her enough yet to feel that I can 
contribute meaningful feedback. The few issues that I have worked with her on 
have given me a very favorable impression of her abilities. I certainly 
expect  to work more with her in the future.  Also, I will get Sara's and 
Susan Flynn's done, just not today. I will be in the office tomorrow, and 
should complete them then. I received a dozen feedback requests this period, 
and it is just taking me awhile to get them all done. I would prefer they be 
a day late, but meaningful. Sorry for the delay.

Thanks,
Tanya

In this case, I would view you as Andrea's supervisor and I would be her 
representative at the PRC which would be here in Houston.

Mark,

Can I schedule the following vacation days?

Monday, July 26
Wednesday, August 18 through Tuesday, August 24

Please let me know if there is a problem.

Thanks!

Marie

It turns out that quite a bit has been happening without us so we may be 
inundated with information over the next day or so.  Let me know if the 
message below does not come through in color since it will be difficult to 
decipher.

Louise is quite anxious to finalize the ETA, PA and Read-only PA and I 
explained that we were still waiting for the proposed changes from London.  
Knowing Louise I have a feeling we may see that stuff soon.

Since we seem to be a bit behind schedule, Louise agreed that an all-hands 
legal meeting next week might be premature and she is contacting the London 
team to discuss scheduling.  I'll let you know as soon as I have anything 
more to report on the calendar.

Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how 
to register,  this is what we are doing.  Any comments or problems please 
reply.  I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email).  

1.  Current Customers

We are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the 
launch.   These customers will not  receive any documentation from us apart 
from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy 
marketing brochure.

They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation.  
All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these 
people.

Procedure
1.  A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled.
2.  Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc.
3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and 
a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details 
nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process 
(to include whether to send to UK os  US office).  The PA will be specific to 
each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to 
each counterparty.
4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to 
Enron. 
5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login.
6.  The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as 
loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the 
country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the 
customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice 
of either "I accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This 
ETA must be printable.
7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.  If the customer is 
transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not 
need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any 
person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords 
can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under 
this SA password).  The system will need to be loaded with the information as 
to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type.

Elena's questions
Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the 
"House"?  No only in the garden.  PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be 
available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion).

2.  New Customers

There are two alternative routes possible.

Procedure 1: Off Line Registration

Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade 
online, i.e. get the ID and Password
Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for 
appropriate jurisdiction.
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either "I 
accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  

Procedure Two:  Partial OnLine Registration
Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in 
the Garden
Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out 
appropriate Registration Form and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and 
mail it to Enron
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either "I 
accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  

The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but 
clearly Janine may want to add more on her side.

Elena's questions
Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both
 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.  YES - 
In the  garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and 
that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for 
all applications)
 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC 
prefers them to be available...YES

3.  Read Only Customers

If a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore 
has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading 
counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are 
missing.  So we will be sending them a password and login for read only 
access.  We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but 
that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this 
would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we 
would authorise readonly access.  We will no be advertising read only access 
as available.

They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be 
capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a 
customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but 
view only.  

Procedure
1.  Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered 
against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has 
not registered.  The trading desk with primary trading contact with such 
counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only 
access for a period of time.
or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only 
access for one of his customers.
2.  The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time 
dated (only valid for a certain period).
3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA  - 
these are to be country specific.  
4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the 
site where he has been given READ ONLY access.  
5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of 
creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password).
6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they 
should register to continue seeing prices.

Elena's issues
1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable 
when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden)
2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in 
session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to 
put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all 
jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although 
one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period 
of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.  Some customers 
may be allowed in for one day others for one month.
3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be 
granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not 
be mentioned in the garden.  The only phrase in the garden refers to 
customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above).
4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to 
Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line, 
but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner 
way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs.

Mark's comments
System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned. 
If they are in reality that is none of our concern.  Agreed - we need to 
change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator
ETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would 
expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it 
(which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System 
Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA.

Guest only users
This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some 
process queries on it. See above.
How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above.
What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for 
full rights?  They need to receive a notice when their password expires which 
prompts them to follow the application process.

2 other queries  -
Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade 
electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understanding
Limitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will 
be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn't

Bob's comments

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.
The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his 
users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?  
Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR 
PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD

3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access
Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer 
base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / 
System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we 
cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed 
off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, 
single point of reference).
The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there 
will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives.

Tim's comments

 The process you have described is as I understood things, except
that for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators,
Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).  As we discussed on Wednesday and
as Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows:

 The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online,
that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator.
Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address,
country of incorporation  etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guest
user, the System Administrator will  e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read Only
ETA.  The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to
Enron (by fax or post).  Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.  The
Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest.
This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going 
to advertise this read only capability.

OK?  

Louise

From the NYT article:

The business that Thomas D. Gros is building for Enron remains untested.
 But his entire career seems to have been aimed at the opportunity. 

 He studied aerospace engineering, worked as an analyst for the Central
 Intelligence Agency, earned an M.B.A. and set up a natural-gas trading
 operation -- competing against Enron -- for British Petroleum. He also did a
 stint on Wall Street with Chemical Bank. 

Edmund Cooper
07/13/99 03:53 PM
Mark, here is a summary of the telephone conversation I had with Clifford 
Chance earlier today - I outlined to you the issue which was raised earlier 
today on the telephone.  Perhaps you could apprise Louise of the situation, 
and find out for definite (if possible!) what will in practice occur with the 
trading system (viz. viewing the long descriptions).

If we need to cross refer to the GTC in the short description, my thought is 
that option 4. below would be the simplest solution based on what we've done 
to date.  I would be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.

Regards, Edmund.

Edmund

Many thanks for this. I agree that it is very important to ensure that the
product descriptions, both long and short, are incorporated into the
contract and that this incorporation is very clear. The ETA states that if
there is no master agreement in existence between the parties the GTCs on
the website will apply. It must be clear from the website which terms these
are.

As we discussed on the telephone, there are a number of ways in which we can
deal with this:

1. the GTCs could state that the long and short form descriptions apply
when trading on the particular GTCs - it would be necessary to list the
products in the GTCs to which those GTCs apply. However, I am not sure how a
counterparty makes the connection between the short form description and the
GTC (possibly by accepting the GTCs when entering the website on the first
occasion).  In any event, if you add a new product later which will be
traded on those particular GTCs it will be necessary for the counterparty to
accept those GTCs again;

2. a new column to be inserted on the trading screen which shows which
GTCs apply - I assume this is unacceptable from an aesthetics point of view;

3. a reference to the GTCs to apply and the long descriptions to be
incorporated in the short form descriptions - I assume that when a
counterparty clicks on a price to bid, this reference would appear in the
bid box with the short form description ;

4. a reference in the short form descriptions to the GTCs being as
stated in the long form descriptions and that both are incorporated - this
is on the assumption that by clicking on a price to bid, this reference
would appear in the bid box with the short form description.

It is very difficult to advise properly as to which of these methods is the
most appropriate without seeing the design of the website. The essence of
incorporation is whether it is clear to the user that the terms have been
incorporated. That said, I assume that 2 and 3 will be unacceptable. With
this in mind,  you may prefer option 4. However, I would want to see the
design of the layout of the website before confirming this advice.

Please let me know if you have any queries concerning this.

Kind regards.

Andrew

Since the recent pet coke swap (deal 8025) is really a US deal, we should 
probably do the documentation here.  Would you please send me a copy of the 
confirm for the coal swap you worked on for us to use as a starting point?

Thanks,

Here are the most recent versions from Clifford Chance.  They were sent to 
Sullivan & Cromwell yesterday to be "Americanized" and are still drafts with 
a number of open issues yet to be resolved - so we can easily make changes as 
necessary to solve issues you may raise.

The PA = Password Application - to be signed by counterparty & sent to us 
before a password is issued.
The ETA = Electronic Trading Agreement - to be agreed to online before 
trading is permitted.
The ROETA = Read Only ETA - to be agreed to online by persons wishing access 
to the site to view but not trade (probably misnamed - should be ROPA or 
something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade).

Dear Louise

Thank you for your e-mail to Tim.  Please find attached revised versions of
the PA, ETA and ROETA taking into account Scott Sefton's comments and our
recent telephone discussions.  Please note that I have not referred to the
NBP side letters as I have agreed with Edmund Cooper that this will be dealt
with in the long form descriptions.

These documents are identical to the documents I sent to Edmund yesterday
save for a minor change to the limitation of liability clause.

I look forward to receiving your comments as soon as possible so that I can
prepare country specific versions.

Kind regards

This is the e-mail I mentioned yesterday.  It is not exactly what had been 
described to me and I do have concerns with it.  My preference would be to 
limit the clause to the providing of letters of credit whenever we ask (as 
opposed to any security in form and from a provider satisfactory to us).  I 
understand that London legal was doing some tinkering with the language but I 
haven't seen anything from them yet.  Let's discuss.
David Hardy
07/09/99 11:54 AM
Mark,

Following the Online Trading conference call, here is the first stab at the  
Credit Clause to include in the GTC's for less credit worthy counterparties :-

"If, for any reason [ Enron ] determines it is necessary to obtain security [ 
Enron ] may in its sole discretion and within one business day upon notice to 
[ Counterparty ], require [ Counterparty ] to provide [ Enron ] with 
satisfactory security, in a format and from a provider acceptable to [ Enron 
].

Without prejudice to any legal remedies available to [Enron] and without 
[Enron] incurring any other costs, losses or damages (whether to 
[Counterparty] or to third parties) arising from any delay or other, [Enron]  
may withhold or cease delivery (whether or not delivery has commenced) until 
[Enron ] receives prepayment, or  cash collateral or an acceptable letter of 
credit or guaranty, as the case may be. All bank charges and other fees, 
commissions, costs and expenses incurred with respect to furnishing security 
to [Enron] shall be for the account of [Counterparty]."

The second paragraph provides a remedy for contracts involving  physical 
deliveries, but  requires some re-working to provide Enron the right to 
terminate specific contracts with a counterparty for trades which are purely 
financial contracts, if the Counterparty failed to provide adequate security 
in suggested time frame.   
Please call if you have any questions.

Regards

David

I will be handling the derivatives side of the ETOL transaction this time so 
future communications should probably come to me directly.  I will be 
reviewing the ISDA draft this weekend and it would be helpful if I could get 
some sort of description of the overall transaction.  Is there a term sheet 
or executive summary of the deal?  If so, my fax # is (713)646-3490.  

Thanks for your note.  Yes, I am available for the call and have asked 
Sullivan & Cromwell to have someone available as well.  As soon as the time 
is firm, I will be able to let you know who at S&C to call.

07/16/99 11:38 AM
After our meeting this coming Monday morning with you, me and Justin, I think 
we're ready to have another all hands telephone conference on Tuesday (like 
the one we had last week) to resolve the issues that have come up over the 
last week or so. Please ask your assistant to schedule something, with the 
meeting to include me, you, Justin, Mark Taylor, Louise, Elena, Andrew, Tim, 
Christopher Millard, anyone else Louise wants to attend and S&C if Taylor 
thinks they should attend. The meeting shouldn't take more than an hour. 
Following our meeting on Monday morning, we'll prepare a list of issues which 
we can circulate late Monday so people can consider them before the meeting. 
Thanks!

P.S. If necessary, we'll cancel our Tuesday afternoon legal trading meeting 
to accomodate everyone's schedules.

Unfortunately, I already have a meeting from 11 to 1 Houston time.  I'm free 
from 9:45 to 11 and then after 1.

Louise - I believe we need a copyright notice on every page on the website.  
AGENCY is aware of this (so far it's only on the Quotes page), however we 
need to give them the exact wording.  I would suggest one of:

   1.   , Copyright 1999 Enron Corp.   (however, I think the word "copyright" 
may be redundant legally speaking)
* 2.   , 1999 Enron Corp. 
    3.   , 1999 Enron Corp.  All rights reserved.  (this may be a space issue)

EnronOnline site currently has:

Legal and Privacy Information
Copyright 1999 Enron Inc.       - (I've told them we'll be changing the 
wording of this.  We should be able to make this a hyperlink as well if need 
be)

Other sites:

Merrill Lynch:

, 1999 Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.   -  hyperlink which then displays all third 
party trademarks, etc.
Important Legal Information  - links to disclaimers and privacy info. etc.

Microsoft:

, 1999 Microsot Corporation.  All rights reserved.  Terms of Use.  Privacy 
Policy.      -  terms of use gives disclaimers, info. on third party links, 
etc. and privacy policy is a separate link

This looks a lot better to me.  What do you guys think?

Mark,

Following the message below, please be informed that I plan to come over to 
Houston 15 January next year and stay for 6-7 weeks (at Murphy's Montecito 
apartments).  Maybe we could change a few words on this before Christmas.  
Also, do you know to whom I may turn in order to settle the practicalities 
(invitation letter to show immigration authorities, insurance, car, etc.)?!

We ought to investigate the possibility of having a Wikborg lawyer over every 
afternoon, with the understanding that the Wikborg lawyer would also be 
available to work on our stuff in the morning. This is our chance to develop 
a relationship with a new Wikborg lawyer who could replace Jarle Erik. Please 
confirm the dates that you will be gone. I assume that you will be back in 
Oslo by March 1. Please co-ordinate your Houston visit with Mark Taylor. 
Thanks!

I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the "green book" and 
my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an 
Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far 
enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number 
when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the 
Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against 
us, we are cushioned by our "out-of-the-moneyness" and will be able to ask 
for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in 
the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption 
that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We 
need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the 
credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be 
given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the 
paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language 
(taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells 
us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far 
we go out of the money:

 "Credit Support Amount" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as 
provided in the definition of that
  term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts.

I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would 
like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of 
alternatives for Paragraph 13.

Mark, I apologize for not having responded sooner, however I have been in and 
out of the office and did not see your email until yesterday.  Let me know if 
you still need me to fill out David's performance review.

Thanks
John 

   
	
	

My apologies for the late notice in requesting your performance review for 
David Portz.  He was incorrectly listed in the system as an employee under my 
supervision and I didn't see his suggested reviewer list until today.

Mark,

further to our recent conversation, I attach the senior debt intercreditor 
agreement which ECTRL and all the other parties will be required to resign as 
part of the sub-debt / equity deal.

However the resigning is necessary purely in ECTRC's capacity as party to the 
Financial Hedge Swap (a contract which ECTRC signed at new year 1998), and is 
nothing to do with the current draft currency swap. 

Concerning your comments on swap itsself, the ability of the Delaware Trust 
to perform under the swap is purely a function of Enron (in this case ETOL) 
performing its obligations under the subdebt agreement. Milbanks (acting for 
the investors and the draftsmen of the swap docs) have no doubt provided that 
whilst ECTRL need only pay $ when it receives o, ECTRL may not terminate the 
swap or cash out if the Delaware Trust does not perform because ETOL has not 
performed. This is probably the optionality to which you referred when we 
spoke.

Robina is aware of this. She is awaiting pricing from Harry. Both you and 
Harry should feel free to contact Robina (on 171 316 7438) to discuss any 
terms of the swap which are not clear to you. (I am now on holiday until 2nd 
August).

In case you don't already have it, I also attach the deal structure chart 
which may be of some assistance.

Our timetable is to CLOSE on August 12th. We would like to have all docs in 
agreed form by the end of July.

Thanks for your help.

       Mark

  
PS: Paul Coleman is from Slaughter and May and is representing Enron on the 
deal.

Dan,

Thanks for the drafts.  I believe our only comment comes from our 
confirmation desk that the Commodity Reference Price in Enron3.doc should be 
"OIL - WTI - NYMEX".  Give me a call (713-853-7459) if you have any questions.

Mark

   

Jung / Mark,

I've attached amended trade confirmations in connection with the June 29/99
swaps, black-lined to show Enron's requested changes.  Please note that
moving one of the swaps under the TD Bank ISDA agreement will require a new
guarantee from Enron Corp. (I imagine you'll simply duplicate the guarantee
provided for the TD Texas swap?) - can you please forward same to Anne
Scully in Houston.

Please give me a call at (416) 983-9473 once you've had a chance to review
the attached.

Thanks,
Dan

I don't have a problem with Brent being our primary contact there.

Sara Shackleton
07/23/99 09:44 AM
I've been working with our desk to create draft confirm which Brent received 
yesterday.  Should I be dealing with Julian?  SS
A few minutes ago Scott Neal spoke to Claudio Majul from C. Puerto and 
executed the swap.
Puerto is now waiting for the confirmation.

Sara, let's work on the terms of the confirmation, and once ready send it to 
Scott for him to fax it to Puerto.

If anyone has questions pls. call me

Julian

One day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to Heaven. There he meets the 
Lord himself. The Lord says
to the cat, "You lived a good life and if there is anyway I can make your 
stay in Heaven more comfortable,
please let Me know."

The cat thinks for a moment and says, "Lord, all my life I have lived with a 
poor family and had to sleep
on a hard wooden floor."

The Lord stops the cat and says, "Say no more," and a wonderful fluffy 
pillow  appears.

A few days later six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to 
Heaven. Again the Lord is
there to greet them with the same offer.  The mice answer, "All of our lives 
we have been chased. We have
had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms.  Running, running,  
running;  we're tired of running. Do
you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore?"

The Lord says, "Say no more," and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller 
skates.

About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep 
sleep on the pillow. The Lord
gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing. The cat replies better 
than I could have ever expected.
And those Meals on Wheels you've been sending by are theeeeeeee best!!!"

Here is the draft form for the US derivatives GTC.

I think this is the most recent version of the ETA.  Obviously, this is the 
UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document.  The US 
version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.  We're 
also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process 
since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be 
different from the UK version.  Speaking of which, I was surprised to find 
that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site 
records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.  
What's the practice in your part of the world?  One alternative is to insert 
the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which 
says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time 
(2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed 
acceptance.  Would that work for your deals?

Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is 
insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.  I'll be 
calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since I'm sure you 
will have issues to discuss - and now is the right time to get changes made 
to the ETA if necessary.

FROM:  Andrew Wilkinson

Dear Mark

Further to my various emails on Friday 16 July 1999, please find attached a
copy of the UK ETA which shows the amendments from the drafts I sent to you
on Friday.  All of these changes have been inserted into all Electronic
Trading Agreements for each of the primary jurisdictions.  These changes
have been made following my conference call with Scott Sefton, Justin Boyd,
Louise Kitchen and others yesterday afternoon.

I also attach a revised draft of the UK Gas Physical Beach GTC and the
Zeebrugge Gas Physical GTC marked up to show the changes to the versions
sent to you last Friday.

I would be grateful for any comments on these documents as well as those
sent to you on Friday.

Kind regards.

Mark,

Following the message below, please be informed that I plan to come over to 
Houston 15 January next year and stay for 6-7 weeks (at Murphy's Montecito 
apartments).  Maybe we could change a few words on this before Christmas.  
Also, do you know to whom I may turn in order to settle the practicalities 
(invitation letter to show immigration authorities, insurance, car, etc.)?!

We ought to investigate the possibility of having a Wikborg lawyer over every 
afternoon, with the understanding that the Wikborg lawyer would also be 
available to work on our stuff in the morning. This is our chance to develop 
a relationship with a new Wikborg lawyer who could replace Jarle Erik. Please 
confirm the dates that you will be gone. I assume that you will be back in 
Oslo by March 1. Please co-ordinate your Houston visit with Mark Taylor. 
Thanks!

Taffy - the airline called to say I have to leave a day earlier on my

I particularly like the grand prize winner.

   

The grand prize is just crazy enough to work...

A contest was held for people to submit their theories on ANY subject.
Below are the winners:

4th RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Probability Theory).   If an infinite number of
rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an infinite
number of shotgun rounds at an infinite number of highway signs, they
will eventually produce all the world's great literary works in Braille.

3rd RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Bio-Mechanics).  Why Yawning Is Contagious: You
yawn to equalize the pressure on your eardrums. This pressure change
outside your eardrums unbalances other people's ear pressures, so they
then yawn to even it out.

2nd RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Symbolic Logic).  Communist China Is
Technologically underdeveloped because they have no alphabet and
therefore cannot use acronyms to communicate technical ideas at a faster
rate.

1st RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Newtonian Mechanics).  The earth may spin
faster on its axis due to deforestation. Just as a figure skater's rate
of spin increases when the arms are brought in close to the body, the
cutting of tall trees may cause our planet to spin dangerously fast.

HONORABLE MENTION (Subject:  Linguistics).  The quantity of consonants
in the English language is constant. If omitted in one place, they turn
up in another.  When a Bostonian "pahks his cah," the lost R's migrate
southwest, causing a Texan to "warsh" his car and invest in "erl" wells.

GRAND PRIZE WINNER (Subject:  Perpetual Motion).  When a cat is dropped,
it always lands on its feet, and when toast is dropped, it always lands
buttered side down.  It was proposed to strap giant slabs of hot
buttered toast to the backs of a hundred tethered cats; the two opposing
forces will cause the cats to hover, spinning inches above the ground.
Using the giant buttered toast/cat array, a high-speed monorail could
easily link New York with Chicago.

FASB133 One Way vs. Two Way Payments- EB3325  

Here are the most recent versions of the US documents.

Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

Best regards.

Attached is a  memo from Jeff Hodge regarding the above.

The memo below is the attachment referenced in the above memo.

My apologies for any confusion resulting from my e-mail yesterday.  While the 
GTC's must be finished this morning, Legal's revisions to the short and long 
descriptions are not due until Friday August 6.  I think it would make sense 
for us all to get together to discuss how these work early next week.  I will 
ask Taffy to set something up.

Mark

Here are my revised versions - I look forward to your comments.

As discussed the table to be completed by August 4th in order for us to start 
loading the customer profiles into the system.

The following worksheet is split into two tabs for the counterparty groups 
suggested by the North America commercial versus those counterparties 
suggested by Europe commercial.  The US tab consists of the following 
information:  

Column A Fed Tax ID (needed for physical global products counterparties)
Column B Country where Headquarters is located
Column C State of Incorporation
Column D Country of Incorporation
Column E Counterparty Name
Column F Dunnes Link ID
Columns G-CU Product Types/Enron Legal Entity

The Europe Tab is set as follows:

Column A Country of Incorporation
Column B Counterparty Name
Column C Dunnes Link ID
Columns D-CR Product Types/Enron Legal Entity 

The matrix is blank assuming that all counterparties can trade all product 
types/Enron Legal Entity.  The above  responsibility groups will need to 
perform a detailed review by placing a "X" in the intersection of the 
counterparty/product types indicating that that Product Type should not be 
offered to that counterparty.

This review needs to be completed by no later than cob August 4, 1999 so that 
we can remain on our overall click trading schedule.

Regards,

Kevin

Here are the contract forms which I delivered in hardcopy this afternoon.

Louise,

I hope you had a pleasant weekend in N.O.  If you have a few minutes to 
spare, I'd like to get together with you this afternoon  to talk about the 
weather deal documentation.  As I tried to draft up the standard GTC's I 
realized there are more variables in these transactions than are currently 
listed in the short & long description lists.

Mark

I will be there.

let me know asap if this is going to be a problem.  

I am waiting to hear from David Gilbert/Ken Raisler of Sullivan & Cromwell to 
ascertain who will be attending.  I will follow up this pm.

Andrew Wilkinson will not be able to attend this meeting - he is on paternity

Thank you.

was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the 
first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus 
musculus.  Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the 
wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure 
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose 
folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the 
second part).

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective 
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual 
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through 
their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head 
coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness 
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such 
a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from 
my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this 
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected 
as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be 
said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my 
incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered 
conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,  
piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it 
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. 
With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more 
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, 
expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of 
the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et 
al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through 
which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 
180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity 
and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad 
entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of 
carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His 
resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of 
assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary 
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The 
capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with 
blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the 
coloration of Albion's floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, 
or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much 
as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared 
like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, 
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative 
seasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when 
he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the 
manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in 
short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the 
optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every 
effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one 
eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that 
trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, 
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the 
aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned 
previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this 
task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in 
lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in 
a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating 
(in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector 
onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his 
contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded 
to soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the 
seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting 
exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits 
of visibility:

"Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency,
and to that self same assemblage,
my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly 
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn."

As requested a "final" meeting has been arranged on Monday, 9th August at 
Clifford Chance (a room has been booked for the full day).  Could you please 
let me know asap if this is going to be a problem.  

I am waiting to hear from David Gilbert/Ken Raisler of Sullivan & Cromwell to 
ascertain who will be attending.  I will follow up this pm.

Andrew Wilkinson will not be able to attend this meeting - he is on paternity 
leave at present.

Thank you.

Here are the contract forms which I delivered in hardcopy this afternoon.

Here is the spreadsheet which lists all of the existing counterparties 
proposed to receive access to the online trading system.  Louise has asked us 
to identify for each counterparty those products from which, for legal 
reasons, such counterparty should be restricted.  As you might expect, our 
goal is to have as few restrictions as possible.  

Since it is so wide, you may find that it is easier to modify the spreadsheet 
(by hiding various columns) in order to print it out.  If you need any help 
in this regard, please let me know.
As discussed the table to be completed by August 4th in order for us to start 
loading the customer profiles into the system.

The following worksheet is split into two tabs for the counterparty groups 
suggested by the North America commercial versus those counterparties 
suggested by Europe commercial.  The US tab consists of the following 
information:  

Column A Fed Tax ID (needed for physical global products counterparties)
Column B Country where Headquarters is located
Column C State of Incorporation
Column D Country of Incorporation
Column E Counterparty Name
Column F Dunnes Link ID
Columns G-CU Product Types/Enron Legal Entity

The Europe Tab is set as follows:

Column A Country of Incorporation
Column B Counterparty Name
Column C Dunnes Link ID
Columns D-CR Product Types/Enron Legal Entity 

The matrix is blank assuming that all counterparties can trade all product 
types/Enron Legal Entity.  The above  responsibility groups will need to 
perform a detailed review by placing a "X" in the intersection of the 
counterparty/product types indicating that that Product Type should not be 
offered to that counterparty.

This review needs to be completed by no later than cob August 4, 1999 so that 
we can remain on our overall click trading schedule.

Regards,

Kevin

I understand that you may be in the Houston office at some point this week.  
If so, I would like to get a few minutes on your schedule to talk about South 
American Legal staffing issues.  Could you give me a call (713-853-7459) or 
drop me an e-mail with what might work for you?  If you are not actually in 
the office but have some time to talk on the phone, that would work too.

Thanks,

Digital Frontiers 
 Calif. Says Digitally Signed Broker Contracts Are Valid
 By ROSS SNEL
   
 08/03/1999 
 American Banker 
 Page 12 
 Copyright (c) 1999 American Banker, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

 A new California law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most, if not 
all, of their business in
 cyberspace.

 The legislation, which applies only to broker-dealers, validates brokerage 
contracts that are digitally
 signed.

 Though Internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line, most 
require customers to enroll
 and order account transfers by sending in paper documents. The law makes 
such paperwork no
 longer necessary.

 Digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds 
customer identities to
 documents-are seen as a way to "legalize" on-line exchanges of information.

 The California legislation, which California Governor Gray Davis signed into 
law last week, "gives
 people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable," said Thomas J. 
Smedinghoff, a partner in
 the Chicago law firm McBride Baker & Coles and a leading authority on 
digital signatures.

 He added, however, that the law's specific definition of a digital signature 
could limit the flexibility of
 its application as the technology evolves.

 Certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important 
to securities brokers, because
 securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise 
transactions on the Internet, said
 Christopher Musto, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors Inc. in Concord, Mass.

 E-Trade Group Inc., the Menlo Park, Calif. on-line broker, pushed for the 
California bill, bringing the
 issue to the attention of state Sen. John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San 
Jose. Sen. Vasconcellos
 introduced the proposal in February, and it passed the Senate July 15.

 San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., the leading Internet brokerage, 
also offered input on
 the law's definition of a digital signature, according to Sen. Vasconcellos' 
chief of staff, Rand Martin.

 Schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level, 
however, a spokesman for the
 company said. "This action is a step in the right direction," the spokesman 
said. "But the real objective
 would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the 
use of digital signatures."

 E-Trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its 
transactions with customers in all
 50 states, but the Schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond California 
is "murky."

 E-Trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law 
applying across the
 country.

 Mr. Smedinghoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's electronic 
commerce division, said the
 only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated 
that a contract was
 governed by the laws of California.

 Legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state. For example, 
Connecticut law covers only
 medical records at hospitals, while Illinois makes electronic signatures 
applicable to all
 communications.

 In 1995 California became one of the early adopters of digital signature 
legislation, but that legislation
 was limited to communication with government agencies.

 Utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter, with a 
comprehensive law that
 preceded California's in 1995 and resulted in the pioneering designation of 
Digital Signature Trust
 Co., a Zions Bancorp. subsidiary, as a licensed certificate authority.

 To bring consistency at the federal level, Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) 
this year introduced two
 bills addressing the issue. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act sets out to 
clarify the legal status of
 electronic signatures in general, while the Electronic Securities 
Transaction Act focuses on the
 securities industry.

Alan Aronowitz's group is handling actual bandwidth.  If it ever becomes 
financially traded, we will treat it like any other derivative.

Just curious, which legal group will support global bandwith trading?

I'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night.  I'll bring along some 
sailing info. but thought I'd let you know now what we've got in mind.  Dan & 
Jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 6 of 
us.  We have gotten a quote for a relatively new 46' sailboat in the British 
Virgin Islands for the week of Thanksgiving.  We'd fly down there on Saturday 
the 20th, pick up the boat the next day and return either Saturday the 27th 
or Sunday the 28th.  [The return date is still under discussion - so far we 
have (i) Jamie who wants to fly Saturday so we have a day at home before 
going back to work, (ii) Mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as 
possible so wants to come back Sun., and (iii) Ted who when he heard the 
question said "Let's start back Saturday and spend the night in South 
Beach!"]  The charter company is the Moorings (their website is 
www.moorings.com) and the specific boat we reserved is called a Moorings 
463.  You can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three 
separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom.

Each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible - get up whenever (I seem to 
remember Jamie getting up pretty early & making coffee), have breakfast on 
the boat, decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked 
out, maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way, maybe 
not.  Maybe stopping for lunch somewhere, maybe making sandwiches while we 
sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day.  Most days we only 
actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 2 or 3:00 
and spend the afternoon swimming (Ted's favorite), snorkeling (the masks, 
etc. come with the boat), hiking on shore, exploring the coastline in the 
dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading, chatting, napping or 
whatever (my favorite).  There's a CD player and we listen to a variety of 
music - luckily Ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal 
proclivity for the duration of the trip.  If you scuba dive there are dive 
companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip - there is 
at least one really good wreck dive (in 70 - 90') in the BVI.  If you want to 
learn to dive, you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in 
NYC and do your certification dives in the BVI (Dan & Jamie might be diving, 
Ted & I probably won't).  Sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail 
hour for me.  There's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of 
these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the 
boat with food (there's a fridge, stove & bbq grill on the boat) and as you 
might guess Dan and Jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board 
if we don' feel like going ashore.  While no one is excluded from any 
activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary, we don't 
always do everything together, either.  Everybody usually pitches in and 
shares what work (cooking, cleaning up, sailing stuff) there is, although if 
only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and Ted probably wouldn't 
be expected to cook.  In the past Jamie has been the only smoker and he has 
invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck.

As for $,  the boat, provisioning (food on board for breakfast lunch and a 
few dinners), taxes, airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night 
we get there all comes to about $760 per person.  Extras include drinks (only 
fair since you and Jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us) and any 
dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare.  I've tentatively got  
flights for you (through the boat company) that come to $544 per person, 
though if we decide to come back on Saturday that might go down.  Ted & I 
usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're 
not always successful.  It's such a popular week to sail we need to decide 
pretty soon so we can put a deposit down - the boat is not actually reserved 
until we do.

I'd better stop & send this - it's turned out to be a good bit longer than I 
intended but I get carried away sometimes when I daydream about sailing!  
Check out the website & let me know if you have any questions.

Sorry about all these - it looks like people who don't know my address are 
just guessing and they get you instead.  I'd appreciate it if you could 
forward them on to me when they come to you - I'll let the sendersknow the 
correct address as I get them and hopefully that should cut down the number 
going forward.

Mark

Do I need to continue to forward these to you, or are you already receiving 
them?

<<July 20th Meeting Minutes.doc>>               <<mastlist.doc>>

 - July 20th Meeting Minutes.doc - mastlist.doc

Let's add this as an agenda item to discuss when Sara and I are there.

We're thinking about flying down to some nice sunny spot and renting 
("chartering" is the technical term) a boat for a week.  We've done this 
quite a few times in previous years: British Virgin Islands, Martinique, St. 
Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Grenada, etc.

I'll be there!

   

We've actually reached and passed our target of 300 executed master swap 
agreements, so Bill Bradford and Mark Taylor would like to invite the 
Legal/Credit financial trading team to  a celebration!  Please join us on 
Wednesday, December 9 from 5:30 to 7:30 (or longer!) at Cafe Noche located at 
2409 Montrose (just north of Westheimer at Fairview).   Please RSVP so I can 
get a head count.

 To give you an idea of where we were and where we are now, the earliest 
Pending Swap Update I have dated 7/27/94 (shortly after I started with Enron) 
shows:

ISDA Masters:  10
Other Masters:  44
Total Counterparty Masters:  54
Internal Masters:  3

Our current master total per Lotus Notes are:

ISDA Masters:  164
Other Masters:  158
Total Counterparty Masters:  322
Internal Masters:  57
Current drafts out to counterparties:  595

Kudos to everyone for a job well done!

Just to give you an idea of the kinds of things Brent and Andrea are working 
on.
Priority schedule for Brent and Andrea, as of Tuesday August 3rd.
Here is the order we will work on documents and issues:

1.  Preparing response to Neuquen request for additional stamp taxes (to be
sent out today)
2.  Renault gas termsheet (John reviewing final draft)
3.  Central Puerto 10 year gas termsheet (Gaby reviewing final draft with
Guillermo's comments)
4.  Gas contract for Ferrum  (John to review final draft)
5.  Refineria San Lorenzo (parties have agreed on final form, last draft to
be sent today)
6.  Quintana long term deal  (cp reviewing stamp tax letter)(cp has sent
comments on draft for our review)
7.  Quintana short term deal (cp reviewing stamp tax letter)(cp has sent
comments on draft for our review)
8.   Answer Beth Rosen's tax question on legal status of ECEASA if it doesn't 
pay taxes pending award of tax exemption (review Steve's lawsuit issues for
relevance to our request for exemption)
9.  Preparing new response and documents to be sent to ENARGAS (to be sent
out on Wednesday)
10.  Review YPF confidentiality agreement for offtake side of prepay. 11.  
Central Puerto Power swap (Scott Neal to readjust deal ticket and new
confirm to be prepared today)
12.  Review of status of EPCA in purchasing and selling natural gas (answer
for Guille)
13.  Brazil power trade (Brent to co-ordinate with Andrea Bertone)

We will try to get to all the priorities, but will not likely be able to 
complete everything today.  If anyone wants to change the order of priorities 
or add to the list please let me know so we can discuss our schedule.

We are waiting for comments on the following documents which are listed in no
particular order:
1.  Preparation of modification to Bagley addendum for delivery after payment
(Bagley reviewing proposal)
2.  Y2K mission critical plan and meetings (Brent to co-ordinate)
3.  Total MOU for Austral Basin (Waiting for executed copies to come back
from cp)
4.  Vandenfil (waiting for financials)
5.   Minera Alumbrera power swap or power sale (waiting for further
information on proposal)
6.  VW gas termsheet  (Draft prepared that needs review, now on hold) 7.  
Bagley meeting to discuss ENARGAS issue (John to arrange for Andrea and
Guillermo to be a part of meeting)
8.  Power offer for ICI  (sent to cp for review)
9.   Seeking return of final portion of deposit on Scott Porter's and Bill 
Butler's apartments.
10. YPF on new stamp tax proposal (pending execution)
11. Cenral Puerto MOU (sent to cp for final sign off)(Gaby recieved comments?)
12.  Preparing drafts for possible restructuring for four Demand Marketing
customers  (sent to cp for review)
Power offer for Ferrum (final offer sent yesterday)
Preparing extension of PDA contract (on hold pending pricing)

I am also still working on another draft of the Broker Agreement format but 
it is low on my priority list at the moment.   ECT is also in the process of 
a trading contract audit which we will participate in (this will give us an 
opportunity to try and finalise our various contract forms for review in 
Houston).  Based on comments from Guillermo Canovas and EI litigation 
managers I need to review the dispute resolution provisions in all our 
contracts.

Please do a card for my rolodex.

Thanks

Marcus:

When we were in New Orleans I mentioned that I might be planning a holiday in 
Germany - well, I've finally gotten around to scheduling it.  I'm flying into 
Munich on the 27th and leaving from Amsterdam September 9.  If you are going 
to be in the office next Monday or Tuesday (when I'll be in the London 
office), I'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time to get whatever 
suggestions you would like to make.  If you will be out next week, maybe we 
could chat by phone tomorrow or Friday.

Thanks!

 Tanya   - Is it possible that Credit could include the restrictions listed 
on the Executed Master Agreement list (see current version in attachment 
below) on your department's  Credit Watch List?    In one of our group 
meetings, we were discussing this idea.   We thought it might more sense to 
include the information on an existing report, instead of creating another 
report.    Please let me know.

 Please send the attached list to all ECT North America as a WORD DOCUMENT 
today, Wednesday, August 4, 1999.   The subject should read as follows:   ECT 
North America Executed Master Agreements.   The text should read as 
follows:   See the attached list of executed Master Agreements (covering U.S. 
and Canada financial transactions only).

 

In order to complete the approved list of counterparties fo the new online 
trading system I need a list of master agreements you have negotiated that do 
not have all the necessary representations (e.g. trade option exemption) and 
definition references to permit trading energy commodity derivatives.  Friday 
noon would be soon enough.

Thanks,

Mark

Dear all,

As already promised to some of you, attached is a copy of the transaction
summary (very big picture) which we prepared for the purpose of distributing
among the senior lenders.  It includes a structure chart.

Please note that, also as already indicated to some of you, ECT Europe Inc.
is to play no part in the transaction.  In this respect both the attached
summary/chart and the documentation are out of date.
This will need to be taken account of when preparing your opinions.

Kind regards,  Paul Coleman.

Apologies for my delay in responding to you.  Carol St. Clair is helping me 
with this transaction now.  She will get back to you on the confirms.  Please 
copy her on future e-mails.

If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, 
 it's just possible you haven't fully grasped the situation.

I'm off to London tomorrow (after a stopover day in NYC and back next Wed.) 
but T will be around all weekend.  Are you guys here or traveling again?

I will not be available for the call on Friday.

Here are the revised North American documents.  Those with "(credit)" in the 
document name contain the letter of credit language.  I suggest that you not 
consider the EGLI and ELFI documents as final until we get sign-off from 
Credit as to the "Buyer posts" language which I suspect they contain.

I like to leave for London at least a day earlier than absolutely necessary 
so I have a day to get adjusted to the time change - otherwise you get off 
the plane and go straight to the office (with a shower on the way if you're 
lucky) and I'm exhausted at that point.  I don't ever sleep well on the 
plane.  This time I'm leaving on Friday afternoon to stop in NY for a party 
Friday night and then leaving for London from there on Sat. night.  Since the 
company pays for business class, there's no savings for going over the 
weekend.  I could get a free companion ticket for T but he's never been able 
to get off work at the same time I have to go.

The rest of our August is a bit hectic, too.  Next weekend T has a swim meet 
in San Francisco and I leave that Mon. night to spend the rest of the week in 
S. America. The following weekend we had tentatively set a trip to Laguna 
Beach but I think it's been canceled for lack of funds if not just so I can 
catch my breath.  We leave on our big trip to Europe (Germany, Belgium & the 
Netherlands) on the 26th and don't get home til 9/12.

I have to pack tonight so I think we'll pass on the film.  I hope we get a 
chance to get together some time in the next few weeks - maybe a weeknight 
dinner some time since the weekends look pretty full?

It strikes me that it would be appropriate to offer this service without the 
application fee and deposit to Platinum Elite members and Presidents Club 
members.  If not, the fact that ANY spaces are being removed from the already 
inadequate supply will only infuriate me, not make me happy. 

   

As a frequent traveler in the Houston area, Continental Airlines would
like to tell you about a new guaranteed parking service at Bush
Intercontinental Airport (IAH) being introduced by the City of Houston
Aviation Department.

The IAH Sure Park is a members-only service that guarantees you a parking
space on a secure floor (2nd level) via a private entrance in the C East
Garage, along with a private expedited exit.  The C East Garage is
adjacent to Terminal C and parking will be available 24 hours a day, 365
days a year.   There is a one-time application fee of $200 along with a
$50 refundable deposit for the access card.  When you use the IAH SurePark
facility, the charge is $15 per 24 hour period.  For more information or
to obtain a membership application, please call the Houston Airport
Management office at 281-230-3006 or e-mail your request to
iahsurepark@has.ci.houston.tx.us.

IAH Sure Park is a service managed in whole by the City of Houston
Aviation Department and is offered on a first come, first served basis.

Thanks for the update - I can't say I'm too sorry about any delay since I 
haven't had a spare moment to look at them yet anyway.  This project moves so 
fast and there's so much to do it's scary!

Hey Marc - what time is your soiree tomorrow?

Do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ECT that did not 
contain the necessary elements for trding energy commodity derivatives?  In 
particular I'm thinking about things like the trade opiton exemption 
representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions.

over to London on Saturday - any chance you'll be in that part of the world?

1.  Finance deals for total return swaps may not have had such language.
   2.  A couple of masters may have excluded trade option exemption with 
respect to counterparty or used our "deemed" language.
   3.  Maybe some of Shari's weather masters excluded commodity items.
   4.  Credit Lyonnais AAA Master didn't address commodities.  Are there 
other AAA masters and/or bank masters like this?
   5.  The paralegals may remember something.

Hey Mark,
Nice to hear from you. Sorry we missed all those appointments. I even missed 
the happy hour with Tana and Marie. How long are you going to be in London. 
There is no chance I'll be there before the 15th. I was scheduled to be back 
in Houston  next Monday but it looks like I am spending the next week in 
Abuja, Nigeria. Let me know what your plans are for the following week. 

I don't recall any such deviations from the norm, on the business note , that 
is. The agreements were pretty much standard. You did such a great job, I 
wouldn't want to temper with perfection, would I? Miss you all. Say hi to the 
rest of the gang for me.

Please add OEXP in the cost catalog description:  OEXP covers all expenses 
except for payroll including meals, travel, and hotel (for your expense 
reports).

This work order is being set up in the ATES payroll system.  It will be 
available for this pay period.

I hope this change has not inconvenienced anyone.

Unfortunately, you have the wrong e-mail address for me.  My correct address 
is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.

It's not clear to me which form you want - we have (i) an "Annex A" which we 
use like a general terms and conditions to attach to a one-off confirm (i.e. 
where there is no master agreement in place) and is sometimes called the 
"Omnibus" (because it's a single form for any type of commodity derivative 
which replaced a multitude of separate forms) or (ii) a "Schedule" which is 
attached to the ISDA form agreement to make it our version of the ISDA master 
which can then have a collateral support annex attached.  Just to make it a 
little more complicated, we also have our own form of master agreement which 
we use with less sophisticated counterparties and where we need to translate 
the document into another language (which we don't want to do with the ISDA). 
 Just let me know which one you want & I'll have Tana e-mail it to you.  This 
stuff is all covered in Tana's short-course on ECT derivatives documentation 
- maybe you'd like to sit in on it when she comes over?

Scott Sefton
12/08/98 03:45 AM
I flubbed in my last message. I don't want the deemed ISDA, I want the full 
form Annex A. Thanks!

I'm headed to South America next week.  Any particular issues you think I 
need to be aware of or anything you want me to look into?

   
	
	

The proposed changes to the Risk Management Policy have been approved today 
as requested without amendement by the Board of Directors.
The changes can be implemented as of close of business today (8/10/99).  I 
will forward the revised policy to you asap.
Please let me know if there are others that you wish to inform of those 
changes.
FYI - the next Board meeting is to be held October 12th.  The deadline for 
submission of materials is Monday September 27th.
Thanks 
Ted

Cindy - I won't be able to make the 8/17 meeting.  I will be at the 8/25 
meeting.

   

The Monthly Audit Meeting will be held in two parts this month because of the 
number of issues on the agenda.  Please note the dates/times/locations below 
(the August 17 meeting is new; the August 25 meeting is the regularly 
scheduled meeting you should already have on your calendars).

 Tuesday, August 17, 9 am - 10 am in EB 30C2
 Wednesday, August 25, 9 am - 10 am in EB 32C1

Here is the North American legal issues list I prepared for Mark.  He 
actually called me down to ask for it yesterday (my first day back no less).  
Obviously I've kept it to just the major areas where there might be residual 
legal risk.  He seemed satisfied enough with the format.  I explained that I 
had mentioned his request to you and that you were working on a European 
version which might turn out to be somewhat longer since you have so many 
jurisdictions to deal with.

The Online Trading IT people have sent us a revised version of the long 
descriptions and a document spelling out the "rules" for how they are put 
together.  Louise is asking for our final comments by close of business on 
next Wednesday (August 18th).  Since I will be out of town then, please 
forward your comments and/or approvals directly to Mark Dilworth.  Questions 
can be directed to Mark Dilworth, Marcello Romano or Louise Kitchen, all on 
the online trading team.

Mark, 

Attached are:

A word document detailing the 'rules' by which product long descriptions are 
structured. 
A spreadsheet containing a tab for each data attribute. 

The spreadsheet first page (LONGS) includes examples of the long descriptions 
for a product out of each product type group (Canadian Gas, NA Gas etc.) 
(these are in column V) - please note ANDY there are no definitions for Coal 
or Emissions locations. 

On each of the subsequent sheets are the long description sentences for each 
underlying data attribute that can contribute to a product (including one for 
each product type) for legal review. 

The product type long description sheet also indicates which GTCs are 
required. 

Please let me know if you have any queries - if I am not available Marcello 
is in the right time zone, and is familiar with all aspects of the procduct 
descriptions. 

regards

Mark

Please note that my correct e-mail address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.  

I understand that there may be a few additional changes but these are the 
revisions from our meeting on Monday.
David Forster
08/10/99 08:49 PM
Attached are copies of the documents which have been revised in accordance 
with our meeting last Monday. Each document can be viewed in "native" or 
redline format to highlight the changes.

I'm not sure if outside counsel needs to see these, or just be told by inside 
counsel that the changes have been made - I'll leave it to you to forward in 
the morning if required.

The Help Guide contains a new Glossary of Terms, but we will be adding (and 
subtracting) to this tomorrow. We will send a revised glossary when complete.

Dave

Mark H. has asked me to let him know exactly what we will be sending out on 
9/13.  Would it be accurate to say it will be no more than a flashy brochure 
with the recently circulated content together with a blank password 
application all in a very exciting package of some kind?

Joao - 

I'm making another business trip to Brazil - this time just to Sao Paolo.  
I'll be there Tuesday to Thursday of this week.  Any chance you will be 
nearby?  I tried to arrange a meeting in Rio too but unfortunately our office 
there is quite small and the only people I need to see will be in Sao Paolo 
then.  I also still get to London every once in a while.  Let me know when 
you are there - maybe we can have dinner.

Mark

Please Note - these are NOT ready to be uploaded to the system!  There are 
blanks for the weather agencies for the European deals - these are not 
referenced in the earlier UK drafts and I don't know who the appropriate 
agencies are.  I have not spelled out the data sources for the European 
transactions either.

Mark -  Would you be available to sit down with me Monday morning (say 
beginning at 10:30) to go over the spreadsheet?  I have quite a few comments 
on the financial transaction items that I was able to understand and several 
questions on areas I haven't yet been able to decipher.  I am particularly 
concerned about the Weather Products generally and the Floating Prices for 
all financial products (the Index tab).  If you could let me or my assistant 
know so I can work out my calendar for the day I'd appreciate it (I've 
blocked out 2 hours but it might not take that long).  Unfortunately I'm 
leaving town mid-afternoon so I have to get these wrapped up.  I'm at x37459.

Thanks!

Mark

p.s. - It might make sense to have somebody from the Confirmation Desk come 
too - what do you think?

Here is the spreadsheet with my comments to date.

The letter looks fine to me  (one typo on the last page where the "O" in 
EnronOnline is not capitalized).

I have suggested that Mark Dilworth, one of the guys responsible for the web 
site development, schedule some time with each of you to discuss the latest 
Long Descriptions spreadsheet.  He can walk you through exactly how it works 
for your commodities so you can make informed comments.

 The addition of Paris is news to me so we may have to make a few extra 
modifications I had not anticipated.  Once you get the info why don't you 
take a crack at making the necessary changes & let me know.  It may be pretty 
obvious but I think I can walk you through it on the phone if it's not.

Louise,

In case you didn't get my voicemail we have been through the GTC's.  
Everything is fine with the exception of some blanks to be filled in 
concerning some European meteorological reporting agences (equivalent of the 
UK Met Office and US NWS) and the data sources.

 US is complete and as we have deals in UK and France this should be 
finalised with Mark's paralegal tomorrow.  On roll-out we only envisage US 
and UK cities, Paris and Oslo so we're only awaiting Norway info as a matter 
of urgency.  We're working Stewart Peter to get this info and the same for 
the other European cities for when they're added over time.

Regards,

Mike.

Who knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre.
__________________________________________________________
Stick with this.....it's worth it!  This is the strangest thing I've ever
heard.  The series of events that had to have taken place in order for
this
to happen are astounding!  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for
Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his
audience
with the legal complications of a bizarre death:  On March 23, 1994, the
medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he
died
from a shotgun wound to the head.  Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a
ten-story building intending to commit suicide.  He left a note to that
effect indicating his despondency.  As he fell past the ninth floor his
life
was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed
him
instantly.  Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety
net
had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some
building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to
complete
his suicide the way he planned.  "Ordinarily," Dr. Mills continued, "A
person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though
the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as
committing
suicide.  That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have been
an
unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused the
medical
examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.  The room on the
ninth
floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and
his wife.  They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with
a
shotgun.  The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he
completely
missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus
as
he passed by outside.  When someone, intending to kill person "A," kills
person "B" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.  When confronted
with
a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they both
said
they thought the shotgun was unloaded.  The old man said it was his
long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He
had
no intention to murder her.  Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appeared
to
be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.  The
continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son
loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.  It
transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and
the
son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun
threateningly,
loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his
mother.
The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.  Now
comes the final twist!  Further investigation revealed that the couple's
son
was in fact, Ronald Opus.  He had become increasingly despondent over his
failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.  This led him to jump off
the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgun
blast
passing through the ninth floor window.  The son had actually murdered
himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a
suicide.

I won't be able to attend the forum since I am travelling but do have a 
suggestion that would make TAP a bit more attractive.  When a traveller is 
placed on a "wait list" the agency should check back with the provider 
regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared.  If you wait for the 
provider to get back to you, as appears to be TAP's policy, the chances are 
significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the 
person on the phone before anyone on the list.  Other agents have done this 
for me, I have done this for myself, and it works.

Tana - please send a copy of the Stikeman memo to Peter Keohane.

Thanks!

Mark

Sorry Paige - I was in South America last week - will respond today.

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner (I was out of town last weeek) - 
unfortunately, I have a 2:00 already on my calendar but am available later.  
If you want to meet with Alan & Jeff first and see me afterwards, that's ok 
with me.

Tara Sweitzer
08/19/99 01:22 PM
Torrey, and myself would like to set-up a time for Monday to discuss a few 
EOL issues that we feel pertinent to the Legal Department. If you could let 
me know if  the afternoon ( 2:00) works for you I would greatly appreciate 
it. Once I hear from you I will set-up a room for us all to meet. 

Thank you for your time, TARA SWEITZER

Any idea what database he's talking about?
Paul Simons

It was good seeing you on home ground the other day.

This is just a brief note to remind you of ECT Legal Department's policy 
regarding trading documents.

As you know, all trading documents must be approved by Legal before they can 
be used.  We maintain on a database in London all approved forms of trading 
documents and this database needs to be promptly up-dated as new market 
documents surface.

As our "first line of defence" it is very likely that you will encounter new 
trading forms before anyone else in the organisation. I would therefore ask 
you please to send to Martin Rosell any non-approved form of trading document 
(whether in the form of a broker confirm, an amendment to the NPTA Terms etc) 
as soon as you receive it. This will enable Martin to implement the approval 
process as quickly as possible.

Many thanks, as always, for your help.

Regards

Paul

All,

please review the timetable detailed below for the delivery and final reviews 
of the commercial and Help Guide.

Important dates:-

Monday 23rd August have to review the screen shots to be used in the Help

this so it is ready for delivery to us by Thursday 2nd September.
We get Beta Help Guide to do our UAT on.  To provide comments back on Monday 
6th September to Agency.  So this weekend is again very importatnt to review

I'll be on vacation then - see you in September!

I see what you mean, and I can't explain the bcc - unfortunately, unless they 
use "mtaylo1@ect.enron.com" it doesn't get here.  It must just disappear into 
cyberspace.  Thanks for continuing to send them on.

Mark

Please note that my e-mail address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.  If you use 
mtaylor it goes to someone else and may or may not get forwarded to me later.

Paige - I can be more argumentative here but if it's not going to make any 
difference in the outcome, I don't really see the point.  Let me know if you 
disagree.

While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default 
provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do 
not believe that Statement 133 is appropriately applied to any contract which 
requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a 
default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment 
which may be payable to the defaulting party.  An event of default and 
resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative 
implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract 
itself (e.g. damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults, 
etc.).  

Attached please find a copy of some of the current open issues that must be 
resolved prior to printing the Offering Memorandum.

I'm almost certain you continue to receive these without my forwarding them 
to you.  They show up to me as a bcc:, however I believe they also get to you 
under "mtaylor@ect.enron.com".  I don't know why it would come to me as a 
bcc.  It must have something to do with your ect address.

Attached please find a copy of the Offering Memorandum for Project Tornado, 
marked to show changes from the previously distributed version.  I have also 
included a clean copy for your convenience.

This is an interim draft, but in the interest of keeping to the timetable we 
wanted to distribute it tonight.

Please fax any comments to (212) 451-7679.

If you have any questions please call me at (212) 735-3152.

Mark - It looks like the new version (that I received from Andrew last week) 
does not contain the comments I had already made.  Have those been lost 
somewhere?

Marie - would you please check with Credit and see if you can help with this 
issue.

There will be meetings in Houston at Enron to discuss the new draft of the 
Offering Memo and the To Do Checklist as follows:
1.  Wednesday, August 25th, 2pm-7pm, in EB2868; and
2.  Thursday, August 26th, 8AM-10:30AM in EB 27c1, and continuing after 
10:30AM in EB2868.

The Wednesday afternoon meeting is the MOST CRITICAL because Larry, John 
Osborne of Skadden, and a few others are only available to meet on Wednesday. 
Please make every effort to attend.  In addition, please review prior to the 
meeting not only the revised OM, but also the checklist, a revised version of 
which will be distributed later today to include Bob Baird's and my addition 
thoughts.

For those flying in from NYC, when you reach the Enron Building, please have 
Enron Security call Larry's assistant, Kim Zachery, at 853-1971, who will 
meet you on the 28th floor.  In her absence, please have Security contact my 
assistant, Chaundra Woods, at 345-7621.

I reviewed the ECT confirmation templates today and found that a reference is 
made to a telephone conversation on most of the templates for transactions 
under a ECT Master Agreement. 

The offending sentence is as follows:

"This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into with you 
pursuant to a telephone conversation on <<DealDate>> between the parties:"

I would like to change it to read as follows, with your approval:

"This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into between us 
on  <<DealDate>>:"

This change will allow the current templates to handle both telephone and 
internet trading.

Please advise.

Per our meeting, attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's 
incorporating the tax language and completing the  Reporting Service, 
Reporting Agency and Data Source information.

 

  

 

  

Do you want to set up a time to meet tomorrow?  How does 10 a.m. look for

Welcome to the Legal Dept.!  I think Taffy was coordinating with you 
regarding my dinner with Mark this week,  Unfortunately, my trip was canceled 
at the very last minute this afternoon.  Mark is already aware of the change

Mark would like to meet you for dinner on either Monday or Wednesday night 
next week.
I am doing his itenerary and would appreciate it if you could e-mail me and 
let me know what suits you.  I am of course assuming that you will be in 
London next week.

Thanks

m

Do you want to set up a time to meet tomorrow?  How does 10 a.m. look for you?

Hey Dave!

Thanks for your note.  Believe it or not, it actually is "good to be back."  
And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston 
this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.

We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions 
yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers 
actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I 
are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your 
note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the 
lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.

The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching 
of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.

Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this 
process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long 
descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.

Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the 
lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for 
which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result 
in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be 
able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last 
couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.  
Maybe you can help me prioritize:  should I look first at areas with 
predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the 
quality of work to date?

Talk to you soon.

Mark

David Forster
09/14/99 07:06 AM
Mark,

Welcome back!

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of 
EnronOnline:

1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email)
2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as 
the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to 
individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of 
the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed 
this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a 
representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes 
coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I 
have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - 
otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from 
the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.

It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access 
the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. 
Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access 
the long descriptions in the Product Manager 

3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these 
with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who 
should be looking after this?

  Mark Taylor
  Leslie Hansen
  Jeff Hodge
  Janice Moore
  Alan Aronowitz
  Harry Collins
  Stacy Dickson 

4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have 
been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work 
together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this 
area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's 
against the products and see what you think?

Thanks for your help

Dave

Thanks for the itinerary.  Please note that my e-mail address begins with 
mtaylo1, not mtaylor (which goes to Mitch Taylor).

Please note that Mark Dilworth's demonstration scheduled for tomorrow morning 
(11:00 EB2601a) will not be of the entire EnronOnline system but will focus 
on the portion of the system that builds the long descriptions.  The system 
now builds the entire long description from the various elements - most of 
which we have already reviewed - and displays them as they will be viewed by 
counterparties online.  It is particularly important that the lawyers 
responsible for the long descriptions and the GTC's attend so that we can 
complete the review process.  If you can not attend, please let me know so we 
can set up a time for Mark to show you how to access the system.

Thanks,

Mark

Dave:

One item that was left open after my meeting with Mark D. this morning was 
what the Index should look like and how much input we have had from the 
confirm desk.  My inclination was that the index should be the same language 
that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken 
together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous 
contract.  Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete 
description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal 
text could wait for the paper confirm.

Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that 
the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine 
as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal 
language.

Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make 
sense to give you my version as well.

What are your thoughts?  If you'd like to discuss, I will be in by 9:00 
tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the 
lawyers and Mark to discuss the further long description review at 11.  

Mark

It may be that you don't need to be there at all.  This relates to the online 
trading system that is being built and the legal review of various pieces of 
the system.  If you haven't been involved yet, it probably means that 
somebody else (maybe Wayne, Harry or Janice?) is responsible for the 
commodities you handle.  The project is only confidential in that we're 
trying to minimize information outside of Enron about it.  There's no problem 
talking about it internally.  You're certainly welcome to attend if you want 
to find out more about it, but if somebody else in your group is already 
covering things, you don't need to worry about it.

Mark

I have a meeting at 10:00 am that could interfere with the presentation, but 
I won't know for sure until I see how long the meeting lasts. It has been 
difficult to schedule and the originators are very anxious that it take 
place, so I don't think I can cancel it. I confess I don't understand what 
the presentation is about, and your message did not make sense to me. Perhaps 
because I have not been involved in trading transactions. Can you give me a 
clue without breaching the confidential nature of the project/demonstration?

Dave - could you please give me a call about this - I think it would be 
easier to explain over the phone.  I have an interview scheduled at 9:30 but 
am at your disposal after that.

Tana,

State of incorporation has been captured for a large number of the 
counterparties and has been used as the basis for the determination of 
financial trading status by our tax group.

If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial 
products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should 
ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the 
law in question.

If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to 
list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to 
the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel 
Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would 
at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not 
barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the 
legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial 
products for some utilities under certain circumstances.

Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation 
information to Tana?

One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive 
legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading 
financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is 
there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the 
ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their 
internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm 
reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this 
responsibility.

Mark: Can you comment on this last point?

Thanks,

Dave

   

Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, 
state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the 
country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading 
will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy 
companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap 
trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance 
companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information 
until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you 
cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies 
to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at 
individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.

The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in 
active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I 
know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.  
You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.

Just a 'heads up' - there is now no doubt that there will need to be some 
major revisions to the index language.  I am meeting with some of the folks 
from the confirm desks this afternoon to get them started on a further 
review.  Can you please arrange to have the following people given access to 
the Product Manager:

Jeff Sorenson
Dale Neuner
Bob Bowen
Lynn Shivers
Kevin Sweeney

Dave and Romano,

Here's the language we drafted.  I've put it in a word document because the 
financial option text doesn't fit into the PAI box. As you can see the 
financial option was a bit trickier than the physical options!

I'll be at the gym until 8.  Any chance that would fit into your schedule?

The Netherlands power origination team have concluded the first of the 
so-called transmission deals with the above counterparty. This is a sale and 
buy back structure whereby Enron sells on a border basis to a Dutch 
distribution company who then sells back to Enron a proportion of the power 
on a free on Koppelnet basis. The Koppelnet is the Dutch grid.

The deals are designed to secure as much cross border capacity to take 
advantage of the still significant arbitrage between power prices within the 
Netherlands and those outside. At the moment the grid operator, TenneT, 
allocates transmission capacity on a pro rata basis without charge. This has 
led to significant gaming of the system with huge oversubscription for cross 
border capacity, and the structure we have developed in Enron has been 
designed to take advantage of the system and still stay within the rules laid 
down by TenneT and the regulator, the DTe. Should anyone like to have a copy 
of the 2 transaction agreements, then pls call me. 

We are in negotaitions with other distribution companies in relation to this 
structure.

tks    

Here's my revised version - let me know what you think.

Thanks for your note.  

If you are still trying to decide about shore excursions, I was just 
remembering my trip and have the following observations:

I found the volcano on the Big Island to be marginally interesting, not 
particularly pretty, and from where I was staying (Kona), a very long day.

Kauai was very beautiful - the Na Pali coast is particularly spectacular 
(that coast and the nearby beaches are where South Pacific was filmed) but it 
is quite rugged and nearly inaccessible as I remember it except on foot or by 
boat.  I would highly recommend seeing it by boat if that option is 
available, otherwise, you can just drive up to the end of the road and get a 
pretty good view.  There is also a river boat trip I didn't get to take so I 
can't recommend it - it was popular with visitors.

I didn't make it to Maui but I've always thought it would be fun to go to the 
top of the mountain to watch the sunrise (in a car or bus) and then ride down 
the hill on a bicycle.  

There was a bay near Honolulu on Oahu (near Diamond Head) where I did my 
first-ever snorkeling.  It was very popular (crowded) but a lot of fun and 
while there were plenty of fish to see the reef itself was pretty dead (not a 
lot of pretty coral).

I found the web site for the dolphin lab where I worked but a quick look 
didn't indicate they have a visitors center.  You might call them when you 
are there if you have the extra time and want to go.  
http://dolphin-institute.org/

As far as your clothes are concerned, since you won't have to carry them 
yourselves, why not  take them all!

Have a great trip!

Love, Mark

The language works for me as long as the long description describes 
multi-month options as a series of multiple options.

David Forster
09/23/99 04:24 PM
Mark,

the only physical option in the U.S. at the moment is emissions. Are you

Edmund proposed for UK gas physical options?

Mark,

I spoke with Lynda Clemmons today at the NY roadshow, and understand
that in Shari Stack's absence that you are the best one to follow up in
ref: draft confirmation sent to Shari a few weeks ago.

See attached final draft, in case you do not have it readily available.

I will be out of the office Friday 9/24, but will otherwise be available
to discuss.  PLease review the attached, and if it makes sense, perhaps
we can schedule a call to discuss and wrap things up.

Mark,

Jennifer (PCG) has supplied me with example language from the confirmations 
which is representative of the the other confirmations. I agreed that you and 
I would rework a couple of examples for her, and then she can apply the same 
principles to the remaining descriptions.

I think the best way to proceed on this is if we work up example wording for 
most of the different publication types, and/or verify any wording suggested 
by Jennifer against the original confirm language.

I will bring up the originals to you, but my suggestion for a rework is:

Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL):

The Index for a day shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the 
following calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Oklahoma 
- PEPL section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a business day then 
the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next 
succeeding business day.

Monthly price example (For NGI, Northern California Border):

The Index for a month shall be the "Bidweek Average" price for the Northern 
Cal Border Average as listed in the table entitled "California Border & 
Non-Utility End-User Citygate tables", published in the first issue in such 
month of Natural Gas Intelligence Weekly Gas Price Index.

Monthly price example (For Inside Ferc, Texas,Oklahoma PEPL)

The Index for a month shall be the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co - Texas, 
Oklahoma (mainline) price as listed in the section entitled "Prices of Spot 
Gas Delivered to Pipelines", published in the first issue in such month of 
Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report.

In each of the above examples, PCG will need to substitute the price name and 
section name for each of the applicable prices in each purblication.

Dave

I've put an hour on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to discuss conference 
issues.

Taffy Milligan
09/27/99 05:13 PM
Please advise at your earliest convenience on the below items.

I also need to go over the Master Billing Authorization form with you.  I 
will need to fax a completed form to the Conference Center, Tuesday, 9/28.

Recreation

The following recreational items are available for the conference attendees.  
Do you want to offer?  If so, what type of limitations:
 (TPC Golf $106 per person (includes cart fee) plus box lunch ($5-6.00))
 Tennis  - outdoor courts  (3) @ $12 hr per court
  - indoor courts  (3) @ $18 hr per court 
 Bike Rental @ $8  per 1/2 day
 Spa - See Taffy for menu of treatments - 3 treatments for a 10% discount??

Barbara suggested that we recruit Bob Walker to organize the golf outing.  Do 
you have any objection?

Business Center

I would suggest that we rent at least two additional faxes to accomodate our 
75+ attendees, since there is only one fax machine in the business center.  
The rate is $60 per additional line, plus rental of the fax machine.  Do you 
have any objection.

  

Give me a call with any questions.

Mark,
We are one step away from signing a brand new, much needed master power 
agreement with Duke, with whom we presently have over $46 million of MTM in 
the money exposure without adequate contracts.  That one step is over the 
hurdle of how we calculate termination payments.  Please, as you have so 
helpfully done in the past,  edit the following conversation between Mr. Know 
it All and Mr. Struggler.

Know It All:  I don't have a lot of time so get to the point.

Struggler:  Why can't we supplement  the expression "present value of the 
economic benefit" when we define the word "Gains" with the expression:  
"using the Discount Rate" and defining the term so everybody understands how 
we calculate the present value of the  gains?

Know it All:   I've gone over this a number of times with you before, but 
here we go again:  there are a number of ways to calculate gains and losses.  
when we calculate our gains or losses, we are really just going One method is 
to go out to the market and asking a third party how much they would charge 
us (or pay us) to step into the tragically truncated transaction.   Because 
it is relatively fair, straightforward and easy enough to document, this 
would probably be our first approach in a default situation.

Struggler:  So, why don't we just say:  "the value of the foregone economic 
benefit?"  Why do we even have to say anything about the stupid present value 
of it?

Know it All:  Ahem, because, we want to maintain as much flexibility as 
possible and another method would be to calculate the total string of 
payments we might have expected to recieve from the defaulting party reduced 
by the payments we would have had to make.  Since we will receive the 
termination payment up front, it isn't fair to get the full amount of that 
total but rather only the "present value."  In addition, using the 
replacement transaction (market quote) method the present value is the 
already built into the curve price that's quoted you numbskull!  Another 
method would be to unwind our hedge on the other side of the terminated 
transaction - presumably the amount the counterparty to the hedge would 
charge (or pay) to unwind that transaction will be very close to the amount 
calculated by the market quotation (replacement transaction) method.  This 
last method is quite handy when the terminated transaction was entered into 
to offset a particular trade or when the market has dried up and there are no 
quotes to be had.

Struggler:  Okay,  my understanding of present value is that you imagine a 
guy who is going to get $100 at a future date, let us say, one year from 
now.  Do you follow me so far?

Know it All:  Please.

Struggler:  Now, instead of the guy getting the $100 one year from now, he 
gets it today.  But, the $100 today is worth a lot more  than it will be one 
year from now because the guy is also getting a year of time and time is 
money and he can invest the money at a known return rate and so if you gave 
him the full $100 today he would invest it and one year from now have  $170 
instead of $100 and that wouldn't be fair so you are supposed to give him 
today just the minimal amount you can get away with so he can invest it and 
come out with $100 one year from now.  And so, to figure out how much less 
than $100 to give the guy today, you "DISCOUNT" the $100 by some damn rate 
that everybody seems to know about.   Do you understand?

Know it All:   You've pretty well botched it up at a sixth grade level, but 
that's the idea.

Struggler:  So, now, if we are calculating the "present value of the economic 
gain" of a terminated transaction aren't we basically saying that we would 
have received $100 in the future for the power , however we now should get 
$30 because we have discounted it with the sacred rate and so why can't we 
say that the present value is derived from the "Discount Rate?"

Know it All:  Your lack of real world experience is painful to behold.  Pleae 
make sure you call somebody if you are ever asked to calculate one of these 
things.  The Curves price that is quoted to us by the presumably creditworthy 
replacement counterparty or the counterparty to a hedge that is being unwound 
already takes into account the present valuing principle.  And of course, if 
you end up having to discount a stream of payments, there are big problems.  
First, how will you figure out what those payments might have been?  This 
isn't a loan where principle and interest payments can be caluclated in 
advance with certainty - the payments will fluctuate witht the floating price 
in a swap or the cost of replacement power in a physical deal.  And even if 
we can figure that out how can we agree on the appropriate discount rate?  An 
in-the-money non-defaulting party wants it to be as low as possible since 
that will maximize the termination payment received.  But if the 
non-defaulting party is out-of-the-money then he will want the discount rate 
as high as possible to minimize the payment he has to make.  And just to 
complicate things a bit further, these contracts are usually bilateral so we 
have to be willing to eat what we serve.  So our contract language just says 
the whole thing has to be "commercially reasonable."  In our view that's 
enough to protect us from a rapacious counterparty if we default and flexible 
enough to let us come to a reasonable result when we are the non-defaulting 
party.

Struggler:  I thought the curve was just a list of prices.  You go out to 
October 2000 and you see $34.  Isn't that number the price we expect to pay 
for power or get paid for it on that future date and shouldn't we discount 
that number if we are getting the money one year early?

Know it All:  No!  That $34 is the present value amount we would be willing 
to pay today of what we think for power that will be delivered one year from 
now.

Struggler:  You mean we thing one year from now that power will actually be 
$100 and that discounted, it comes back to $34 on our curve at this very 
moment?

Know it All:  You've got it buddy.  Do you think you can handle that 
concept?  Or do I have to go over it again?  

Struggler:  Hmmm.  Well I guess so, but why don't we just say  "the value of 
the economic benefit based on the Non-Defaulting Party's curve"?

Know it All:  Because then somebody would want to define the word "curve" and 
at that point you are getting too close to our holy of holies and we won't 
ever define our curve.

Struggler.  Hmmm.  Okay.  Thanks.  

If Debbie is talking about the language she and I discussed late last week, 
that is new credit language that has not yet gone in to any of the GTC's.

Debbie, 

I am not sure which language you are referring to.  Some of the GTC's have 
language providing for the posting of a letter of credit by the counterparty 
when the Enron entity makes a request to do so.  Mark Taylor drafted this 
language.  I assume that it is the same as the financial language.  Please 
let me know this e-mail does not answer your question.

Stacy

Mark and Allison.  It is too ambitious to plan to translate this on Tuesday, 
I think.  I need to work with you on the regulatory stuff.  I also will work 
on the other pieces.  And most of this is missing.  Allison, do we have the 
corporate structure pieces in place.  Do we have the financial stuff.  Yao is

We have been asked to implement the Global Counterparty (GCP) system at 
Portland General and EES to support Global Credit Aggregation with our major 
trading partners.  This information includes Counterparty Name, various 
Address data such as documentation (confirmation), headquarters, and 
settlement (including wire bank, ABA, and routing), and various contact names 
and phone numbers such as trader, settlements, etc.

For Global Credit Aggregation to be supported most efficiently, all Enron 
companies must utilize a common identifier for the counterparty on a trade, 
i.e., Southern Energy Marketing for Portland = Southern Energy Marketing for 
ECT = Southern Energy Marketing for EES = Southern Energy Marketing for 
EPMI.  Global Credit must 'see' exposure from each affiliate for a 
counterparty as the same party to aggregate to a corporate level.

For Portland General, the list of trading partners are mostly parties we 
already have in the GCP database.  However, there will be some counterparties 
that are specific to Portland General (the same could also be true about 
EES).  For that reason, I would like to train specific individuals at each 
company to perform the GCP administration/maintenance for their 
counterparties much like we handle the ECT London and Calgary operations.  
What we will have is a system shared as depicted below :

 

There would be select individuals at each company to maintain their 
counterparty information via Terminal Server in a common database maintained 
here in Houston by ECT IT.   This type of access would give these individuals 
access to Counterparty data for all companies regardless of their own company 
affiliation. Each company/business unit will have an extract or view from the 
main database of only their counterparties to support their trading and 
downstream systems versus those systems being integrated directly with the 
main database containing all information.

What I need to know is whether any of you see a problem with this 'sharing' 
of technology and data between ECT and PGE or EES and the intended 
implementation.  Based on Bill Dassenko's understanding of the FERC Code of 
Conduct, we think this proposal is within the guidelines.  Please provide any 
comments or your acceptance of this proposal by Monday, December 21st.    

Thank you.

Debbie R Brackett
12/11/98 04:48 PM
Mary,

This is the list we talked about. Reviewing it briefly, I only see a few that 
we don't already have in GCP. In discussing this with Bill (Dassenko), he 
sees no reason under the FERC code of conduct that we cannot see ( or share) 
public information  about shared counterparties such as would be populated in 
GCP. He is prohibited from sharing specific deal info or exposures, neither 
of which would be an issue in GCP. Hope this helps...I'll be back in on 
Tuesday and we can talk more if you need to.

Debbie 
Date:  12/11/1998  03:58 pm  (Friday)
Debbie,
Attached is a file containing PGE's list of counterparties.  There are a few 
financial counterparties which I have not yet included on this list. All 
names on the list are wholesale counterparties with which PGE trades power or 
gas or are wholesale customers.  There are no retail customers on this list.

In general, under the FERC "Code of Conduct" rules established for working 
with affiliated companies, the unregulated entity (ECT, EPMI) can tell all to 
the regulated entity, but the regulated entity (PGE) can share in only the 
most general of terms. Further,  PGE conversations can not convey any 
information which is otherwise not public about PGE's markets or customers.  
Although the question is a good, I believe I have more to worry about when 
talking to you than what you do when talking to me. Given that I have 
included as complete a list as I have.

Christian Yoder is the ECT lawyer who is tasked with code of conduct
issues for ECT.  His phone number is 503-464-7845.

We have been having meetings with SHCP officials in the last 3 weeks. SHCP is
the government entity that is affected for crude price fluctuations, and has
hedged the crude exports from time to time, but they have not implemented a 
risk
management program yet. The volume of Mexico crude exports is close to 600 MM
Bbl / year, and they can hedge up to that volume.

Yesterday we have a meeting with Carlos Garcia Moreno and Rodrigo Ocejo. It is
possible that they already are hedging part of the volume, but they did not 
said
so. They were impressed with Enron's capability of taking the volume
(transaction up to 50 MM Bbl) and were interested in Enron's market view for
2000. They are interested in quotes for calls, puts and swaps for Cal 2000, 
1st
and 2nd half of 2000 and Cal 2001.

We do not know yet, what is the financial agent that they use to do this
transactions, buy we believe that it can be Nafin or Banco de Mexico.

We think it is necessary start working on the ISDA and a Confidentiality
Agreement with SHCP asap, in order to be ready when the time comes to close 
the
transaction.

We are going to continue meeting these people and start quoting them the 
periods
and instruments they are interested in. Also, we are sending them today a 
Enron
Annual Report.

Regards,

Agustin Perez

My analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides 
additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement 
and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the 
contract will be enforceable.  It is certainly not necessary from my point of 
view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a 
smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact I think that looks 
much better.  It would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the 
"agree" button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work 
until the agreement had been scrolled through.  I personally think that would 
create more problems from a commercial point of view since many 
counterparties will try to click on "agree" as soon as it appears without 
reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away.  

David - do you agree?

Louise Kitchen
09/28/99 03:55 PM
Over to legal - what do you think Mark?

Awais Omar
28/09/99 21:50
Louise,

Below is an example of where a legal agreement which you are required to 
accept, where the "Accept" & "Decline" buttons are below the actual agreement 
and not within the agreement.  The agreement itself is within a separate 
frame above the buttons.

A line of instructional line of copy is given at the top telling users to 
read the agreement by paging down and then to click on accept to continue.

A similar set up would be suitable for the GTC's as these can vary in length 
between products and would allow us to control the size of the window which 
should not cover up the whole quotes screen.

Let me know what you think.

Awais

Same treatment as for telephone trading.

   

What do you want to do with masters where we have a note that we got the 
master in, but we have a bad certificate, and no trading should be done until 
we get a new certificate?

The 15th looks fine.  The 23rd and 24th are already holidays.  As for the 
22nd, please coordinate with the other legal assistants to make sure we will 
have coverage that week.

In this case I would say do whatever is easiest for you guys.  Since we know 
that Enron Canada is qualified, we don't really have to have the 
representation but if it is easier for you to not make an exception, it 
doesn't hurt to have it in.

   
	
	

Mark,

Concerning the representation language given to us recently for Canada 
based/located Counterparties; Should we also include this paragraph in Risk 
Management & Trading vs. Enron Canada deals?

I have spoken to Dale Neuner, who has since forwarded me on to you.  He has 
mentioned that, based on your conversation with him, we may not be concerned 
with an intercompany party needing this representation.  Let us know what you 
think.

Hey Marc - 

I'm here - it's actually nice to be home & not traveling for a while.  Will 
you guys be around this weekend?

It doesn't look like I can help your friend.  We almost never hire lawyers 
fresh out of law school.  Believe it or not, they don't really teach you how 
to be a lawyer in law school so passing the bar is just the first step.  Your 
first job is where your real training takes place.  We just don't have the 
time and capacity to train junior lawyers so we try to hire people who have 
worked for a number of years (usually at least 5 or 6) at a good law firm.  
They get good training there and we don't have to hassle with it.

What's up???  Don't know if you need any attorneys, but a friend of G & mine
just got his law degree and took the bar (will find out in about 4 weeks if he
passed)... he has an engineering degree and currently works for NASA (don't 
even
ask what he does, i don't know, but he can drink alot).  does Enron need any
Atty/Engineers?

how is your world?  you in the states this week?

Earlier today, Thor Lien and I held a 1.5 hours presentation for the ten 
members of the above Committee.  The Committee has been assigned the task of 
examining issues related to commodity derivatives trading in Norway and to 
propose a concrete regulatory framework (currently financial commodity 
trading is not regulated in Norway) on 15 June next year at the latest.  

The background knowledge of the Committee members, representing different 
Norwegian interests, appeared to be quite shifting; while certain Committee 
members had in-depth knowledge of, for instance, EU capital requirements 
others revealed limited understanding of the functioning of the power 
markets.  The Committee took a great interest in the two regulatory points 
that I brought up, the lack of recognition of close-out netting in Norway and 
the forthcoming implications of CAD2.  The discussions sometimes were vivid, 
but I believe that we succeeded in getting most of our message through.  

The vice-chairman of the Committee (lawyer) invited us to render further 
comments in writing and said that he would return to us for further 
discussions when the drafting process was about to start next year.

Martin

I have marked my revisions below.

Mark,

Following is a suggestion for Paper index wording. I will bring up the 
original confirm for you to look at.

Please respond to Jennifer with your comments today, if possible. I will be 
leaving to catch a plane to London around 2:00 today.

Thanks,

Dave

The Index for a month shall be the mean of the arithmetic averages of the 
prices per Short Ton for each such calendar month for Short Ton of 26 Lb. 
Semichemical Medium, delivered in the Eastern U.S. as listed under the 
heading: "Price Watch: Paperboard/Packaging: Grade: Corrugated medium (26 
lb): Semichemical, East" in the issue of Pulp and Paper Week that reports 
prices effective for the calendar month.

Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online 
system.  I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most 
recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that 
I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date.  They do have the advantage of 
being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.  I don't 
think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as 
starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest 
material.

The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective 
counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.  The first time the 
counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required 
to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an "I 
Agree" box after scrolling through the agreement.  The GTC's are the 
contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master 
agreement in place.  Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty 
to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.  While 
most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our 
"Omnibus" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a "Deemed 
ISDA."  One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two 
sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have 
no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is 
not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call 
for collateral if we choose.

Maybe you can just respond to this?

Here is my first cut at an Issues List for Wednesday.  Let me know what you 
think.

My meeting with Mark H. has been moved up to 1:00.  He may want to get you on 
the phone then but I don't really know.

FYI
Below is a report on the Forcenergy bankruptcy case I received this morning.

Forcenergy Seeks OK For Asset Sale, Bidding Procedures
Forcenergy Inc. has asked the court to authorize the sale of seven
oil and gas properties to Hilcorp Energy I L.P. as well as procedures
designed to draw competing bids for the assets through an auction.
The motion, filed Sept. 13 with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New Orleans, requests permission to sell five
Louisiana and two Texas properties and related assets to
Hilcorp, subject to better offers. Hilcorp has offered
Forcenergy $6,086,000 in cash for the properties.
Sierra Mineral Development L.C. indicated interest
in purchasing the Texas and Louisiana properties in late
1998. In March, one month after signing a letter of interest
with Sierra, Forcenergy filed for Chapter 11 relief. Hilcorp
then agreed to finance Sierra?s purchase of the Forcenergy
properties. Any purchase agreement will list only the
names of Forcenergy and Hilcorp.
The terms of the agreement include Hilcorp?s
responsibility to "assume all liabilities related to the Property
after the Effective Date, and all Plugging and Abandonment
Obligations and Environmental Obligations, if any,
regardless of when incurred," the filing reports.
Forcenergy claims that this is a fortuitous time for
the approval of the sale due to the current stable cash flow,
the production of its onshore properties, and the potential
for sustained growth in its offshore Gulf of Mexico drilling
facilities.
The oil and gas explorer and producer also
requested the approval of overbid procedures, recognizing
that new interest in Forcenergy?s properties may come
after other interested parties review the purchase agreement.
Any person submitting an overbid to counsel for
the creditors? committee, Hilcorp, Forcenergy, and the
Bank Group is subject to offering a price of no less than
$6,236,000 and the elimination of any break up expense
reimbursement.
Competing bidders for the assets must submit a
deposit equal to 10% of its bid plus evidence that it is able
to consummate the transaction.

After the last overbid, the court will allow Hilcorp
the opportunity to overbid by an additional $50,000. Any
further bidding will continue in $50,000 increments.
If the court approves the purchase of the properties
by a bidder other than Hilcorp, Forcenergy would pay up
to the $100,000 that Hilcorp estimates it will incur as its
costs and fees related to the sale. If a break-up expense
reimbursement becomes necessary, Hilcorp will provide
documentation of expenses to the court.
Forcenergy also asked the court to approve its list
and calculation of amounts to be paid to cure all of its pre-petition
defaults.
"If no amount is listed, the Debtor believes that
there is no Pre-Petition Cure Amount due and owing to that
party," the motion states.
"The Debtor requests that, unless a party files an
objection to the Pre-Petition Cure Amount so scheduled
and serves a copy on Debtor?s counsel by the time to be
fixed by the Court at the Procedures Hearing, such party
should be forever barred from objecting to the Pre-Petition
Cure Amount," the filing further contends.
The company?s revenues declined after a decrease
in gas and oil prices in late 1998 and early 1999. The
declining revenues also negatively impacted the company
after 1997 and 1998 acquisitions outlays.
The court has not yet set a hearing date on the
bidding procedures request. DBR

My only concern is knowing which way the Inside FERC price adjustment that is 
submitted will go - will it always be plus or always minus?  If so, let's say 
so.  If not, how will it be clear on the web site which direction the 
adjustment is going?

EPMI and RMT are two different corporations.  As I understand it, in North 
America EPMI enters into only physical power transactions with third parties 
while ENA enters into financial transactions.  RMT handles financial 
transactions between wholly-owned Enron companies.  If the transaction you 
are handling is a derivative between ENA and Australia, it should be 
documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and the other between RMT 
and Australia.  That's why the master agreement is between RMT and 
Australia.  I don't know how the booking is handled.

Dale Neuner on 10/05/99 09:10:41 AM
The Enpower ticket shows our Counterparty as Enron Australia  Energy Pty 
Limited. We made the leap that it's Enron Australia Finance Energy Pty 
Limited, since I sent an e-mail to David Minns yesterday asking him to 
anticipate the delivery of the Confirmation. David is the party who is 
handling the ISDA MAster Agreement and is awaiting the Confirmation.

The ISDA MAster Agreement is between RMT (as opposed to EPMI) and Enron 
Australia Finance Energy Pty Limited. If RMT and EPMI are synonomous (as are 
RMT and ENA) then we're done. If they are not, then we have a booking issue 
AND a Master Agreement issue.

Perhaps Susan or Mark can help.

I'm starting to hear rumblings that ECT-NA has the deal booked between EPMI

remedy this?

Is this the 'potential trade' that we spoke about last week. If so, can I get 
a copy of the deal ticket, or whatever information you have.

Jeff,

Enron Australia Finance did a power swap with Enron Houston (PJM index).   
Are you guys going to confirm it?

 Sue

Given the absences, conflicts and heavy work-loads, let's cancel the meeting 
scheduled for this morning.

The same people may be involved but there are tax savings achieved by passing 
all the derivatives through RMT.

Dale Neuner on 10/05/99 10:41:31 AM
Mark -

I am confused on one point:

" If the transaction you are handling is a derivative between ENA and 
Australia, it should be documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and 
the other between RMT and Australia."

It is my understanding that RMT and ENA are the same 'people'. That being the 
case, if we sleeve the RMT to Australia between RMT to ENA, we really haven't 
accomplished anything. 

A question for you and Sue:

Should we be sleeving RMT to EPMI, a relationship for which we DO HAVE a 
Master Agreement in place - if that's where we want the risk to lie.

Dale

Fred called & asked if we could move our lunch from Monday to Thursday or 
Friday.  Does Thursday work for you?

Stephanie:

Sorry I didn't see your response until today.  The prior tenant is moving out 
today so the house will be available as soon as I can get it cleaned up and 
any necessary repairs made.  Let me know if you'd like to see it.

Something must have happened in the transmission process - I can't make

Patricia, after our conversation last week, we put together a complete 
analysis
of the credit risk that we see in the Colombian environment. I really 
appreciate
you take a look and if you have questions please let us know.

We have already requested audited financial statements for the Enercomsa
end-users, however it is not a common practice here in Colombia to request 
this
information. Apparently Enercomsa has been able to collect some of that
information, but it is unclear at this point if we will be able to get 
financial
statements from all customers. We also would like to have your view on this 
and
what would be the risk analysis procedures in this case.

Regards,

Pedro Fernando Manrique

We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any 
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded 
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will 
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet 
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required 
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their 
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant 
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there 
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular 
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the 
utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes 
there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to 
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past 
revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives 
or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 
40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due 
to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and 
master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October.

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up 
against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in 
the system for the launch schedule.

Thanks

Louise

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has 
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones 
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?  
ie their decision whether to trade or not.
Louise

Looks good to me.  Are we certain that all of the other traders plan to post 
daily volumes?

David Forster

That looks fine to me. Please ensure the Volume tab is consistent with this 
description as well.

Mark: Please comment if you have any concerns.

Thanks,

the current paper descriptions says:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted multiplied by the number 
days in the relevant Determination Period."

suggestion:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted by Counterparty on the 
website."

If you all agree, I'll make this change in the BlackMaster. Dave, it may need 
lawyers validation?

need to spend part of the morning at the medical center so with your 
permission, I would like to take a full day of vacation on Friday.
Carol

Good idea.

   

So I don't forget for Monday, Shari just send around the Canadian "eligible 
swap participant" language to be inserted in all Canadian confirms.  Don't we 
also need to add that to the Canadian online GTC's?

Thanks for your help last week.  Saturday night was a lot of fun!

	
	

Mark, the following tax changes to the various financial GTC's and weather 
swaps are those that we have spoken about and effectively adopt the approach 
of our Master ISDA's with regard to taxation.  Just wanted to keep you in the 
loop.  I will be out on Tuesday but, should you need to, you can follow up 
with Jeff Blumenthal.  Best regards.
Jeff Blumenthal
09/03/99 02:24 PM
Dave,

Attached below are the OnLine GTCs that contain the appropriate U.S. federal 
tax language.  As you'll see, our changes are reflected either by underline 
or strikeout in each of the documents.  The 3 attachments below are as 
follows:

  1.  ENA financial GTC
  2.  Enron Canada financial GTC
  3.  ENA HDD swap GTC

As you know, ENA financial (credit) and Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs 
exist in addition to the ENA financial and Enron Canada financial GTCs.  The 
language that we inserted in the attached ENA financial and Enron Canada 
financial GTCs should also be inserted in the ENA financial (credit) and 
Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs.  In addition, there are several weather 
derivative swap GTCs.  The language set forth in the attached ENA HDD swap 
GTC will need to be inserted in all other ENA weather derivative swap GTCs 
(credit and non-credit).

Also, please note that the message you forwarded to me from Leslie Hansen 
appears to relate to the U.S. state tax language to be inserted into certain 
GTCs.

Please call me at 3-5777 if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,

Jeff

Per our (separate) discussions, I have revised the GTCs to reflect (i) the
counterparty's representation that it is a domestic corporation (which, if
correct, would permit us to avoid back-up withholding on reportable
payments, if any, made pursuant to this GTC) and (ii) the requirement that
we provide the relevant forms to the counterparty in the event the
counterparty notifies us that it is not a domestic corporation.

What is the proposed process once Legal receives this kind of request?

EnronOnline@ect.enron.com on 10/12/99 03:13:05 AM
Please respond to EnronOnline@ect.enron.com
Legal approval required for new product type: CRO BANS FIN SWAP
Validated by: AAZIZ at 10/12/99 8:13:05 AM

How does the New Product Type Approval process work?  We have received 
several test messages but it is not clear how we look beyond the short 
description in the e-mail to see the long description (can the short 
description be set up as a hyperlink to the web-site?) or how we are supposed 
to respond (my attempted reply was rejected as undeliverable).  

I noticed that ISDA is putting on a one-day course in London October 19 on 
Documenting and Confirming Credit Derivative Transactions.  If you are 
interested and haven't received the brochure, let me know and I can fax it to 
you.

Sorry for the delay - my e-mail has been down all day.

Dear David,

Here is the version of the above document that Michael and I have drawn up 
for you.  Please note that the English law version of the document needs to 
be printed on Enron Europe Limited letterhead.

Mark - David has also asked for a Texas law version of this document.  Would 
you be able to arrange for one of the Houston lawyers to take a look at the 
document and make any necessary changes which would be required as a matter 
of Texas law.  Please feel free to give Michael Brown or myself a call if you 
need to have a chat about. Thanks.

Kind regards, Edmund.

We may have some problems with derivatives trading in Mexico - see Tana's 
note from earlier today.  I'll start the process for the ETA & PA.

David Forster
10/13/99 09:32 AM
Mark,

Looks like we will have some counterparties in Mexico who we would like to 
set up on the system.

Can you coordinate the preparation of the ETA and PA for Mexico?  (I assume 
it was you who looked after the US/CDN PA and ETA?)

Thanks,

Dave

FYI

We have left a message with Jeff McMahon to see if he will take commercial 
responsibility for either signing the docs, or if he is not authorized to 
sign for these companies, to give the OK to someone else in Houston to sign 
who is authorized.  In the past we have had Dana Gibbs help us out - which is 
another option.

We have been thru these issues before on other transactions, and ECT Europe 
takes responsibility as far as P&L goes.  I'm not sure it works from a tax 
standpoint though to have all these side letters floating around - because 
then it could get us in a tough spot with the tax man.  Our preferred 
approach is to get someone in Houston to stand up for London for signatory 
purposes.

Please advise if you have any comments.

Scott

Scott,

Mark Taylor wants to make sure ECT management is comfortable with assuming 
the risk of all these transactions.  Has anybody on your deal team obtained 
the proper ECT-NA support for these transactions.  If tax reasons are driving 
these deals to ECT-NA, perhaps we will need a side letter where ECT-Europe 
guarantees to ECT-NA performance on these transactions.

Let us know how you want us to proceed to get the necessary signatures by the 
end of the day.

Bill

   

Mark Evans will be coordinating with Sara's replacement today the signing of 
the Customer Swaps (1&2).

I was glad to see that the next Monmouth meeting was rescheduled for a time 
other than December.  I guess Monmouth is a little harder to get to than 
Chicago but it will be nice to see the campus again.

I'm going to be in New York Nov. 1 & 2.  Any chance of getting together?

Mark

The difficulty is in knowing which entites are regulated and which are not.  
For instance, ENA is an "unregulated" affiliate of a regulated utility 
(PGE).  But many utilities have energy services companies affiliates which, 
while not regulated utilities like San Diego Gas & Electric, are nevertheless 
heavily regulated.  We have tried to figure out what we can in the time 
available and have relied on readily available public inofrmation. 

David Forster
10/14/99 08:48 AM
Mark,

Does the legal precedent which we previously discussed, apply to subsidiaries 
of utilities as well as the utilities themselves?

Dave

As far as your email questions, my responses are following:

1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial 
counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note 
below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility 
counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal 
regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters 
in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of 
negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the 
relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot 
approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company 
websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility 
or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due 
diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or 
federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only 
make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a 
regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website 
what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that 
Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, 
unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to 
enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws 
specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this 
until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for 
Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an 
eligible swap participant (or "ESP").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives 
trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain 
financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, 
banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth 
and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say 
"not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the 
financial net worth test.
6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.

	
	

Does this mean that we have 10 utilities that are approved to trade?  What 
are we doing with the other 30-40?
We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any 
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded 
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will 
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet 
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required 
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their 
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant 
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there 
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular 
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the

there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to 
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past

Today's simulation has been postponed to next Wednesday.  Unfortunately, they 
have not yet opened the system to the entire web - you have to be on the 
Enron intranet to get access.  If you want to see it badly enough, I might be 
able to arrange something for you in our NY office (midtown) otherwise I'll 
let you know when they roll it out onto the web.

Mark

As far as I know, this is the policy for all online trading.  Did I miss 
something?

The underlying contractual structure for trades effected on-line between the 
relevant Enron entity and a Counterparty is as follows:

if there is an existing Master for the particular product between the 
contracting parties, that Master will govern on-line trades.
if there is no Master between the parties, then the applicable on-line GTCs 
will apply. 

If the terms of a Master are unacceptable to us for whatever reason (e.g. due 
to insufficient credit provisions), then it may be appropriate to terminate 
that Master.  
If however, we wish to keep a Master in place but do not wish to use it for 
on-line trades, then the counterparty needs to be notified of this and give 
its consent.  Such notice could state that until the Master had been suitably 
amended (i.e. by the negotiation of new credit provisions), then the on-line 
GTCs will apply.

I was glad to see that the next Monmouth meeting was rescheduled for a time

Here are my comments.

Yes, without doubt.  The ETA can't be amended on a counterparty by 
counterparty basis and it says that any applicable master agreement will 
control.  

Leslie Hansen is also working on a draft.  If you get something from Justin, 
please forward a copy to me and Leslie.

Mark,

What is your position regarding U.S. financial EOL trades?  Do you want to 
adopt the same position? (i.e. to override a master, we need a letter sent to 
the customer)?

I believe Justin is drafting something for the physical side. Shall I forward 
a copy to you when it is complete?

Thanks,

Dave,

Please see below, particularly my original e-mail. In case you didn't know, 
Jeff Hodge is the lawyer who heads physical power and gas trading in the US.

Justin

I am in receipt of your e-mail with respect to the above-referenced topic.  
It seems to me that the position Justin Boyd outlined is the one that will 
need to be followed in the US for physical trades.  The Trading Partner 
Agreement which a party will agree to on-line specifically states that if a 
master exists between the parties, then that master will govern any on-line 
transactions.  For those parties who have masters that have been deemed 
insufficient, something will have to be done to override the Trading Partner 
Agreement.  That is what Justin is suggesting-a procedure to override 
unacceptable masters.

If that does not answer your questions, please give me a call.

        Thanks, Jeff

I fully agree with the "fade" effect.  But this looks right to me.  As I 
remember it, we were not totally happy with the Notional Quantity language 
but this was the best we could do.  We were going to make sure that whether 
the submitted volume was per day or per month was clearly reflected elsewhere 
in the long description.  Not elegant, but adequate.

Mark,

This is rapidly fading into a blur. 

I think we discussed this previously and came up with the following for US 
Financial Gas Options:

A Transaction under which the Option Buyer has the right, in relation to the 
Option Seller, in return for payment of the Total Premium by the Premium 
Payment Date, to receive after exercise of the Option with respect to a 
Determination Period, the Cash Settlement Amount for such Determination 
Period being, for a Put Option the Strike Price minus the Floating Price for 
such Determination Period, in respect of the Notional Quantity, and for a 
Call Option the Floating Price for such Determination Period minus the Strike 
Price in respect of the Notional Quantity. The Notional Quantity shall be the 
volume for the relevant Determination Period (calculated using the volume 
submitted by counterparty).  The Total Premium shall be the price submitted 
by Counterparty via EnronOnline multiplied by the sum of the Notional 
Quantities for each Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction shall be a Determination Period.  The Payment Date(s) 
shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating 
Price is determinable.The Floating Price shall be the Index. 

but, I'm not sure if this is latest version we came up with. Could you check 
your emails and confirm the latest version which you were happy with?

Thanks,

Dave

Dave,
The first long product type description below defines a paper product. In all 
paper/pulp products, with the exception of the second one below, 
the description uses the words "volume submitted multiplied by the number of 
days".
Bob Crane of Paper / Pulp Trading, said this confusing due to the commodity 
is monthly delivey. He would like the words "multiplied by the number of 
days" removed from the long descriptions of the paper/pulp product types. 
Should we delete the whole sentence possibly? (See second desription below.)
 

Thanks for your reply.  I think I'd prefer something that's not hosted if 
possible.  I can definately spend more for something that's either very nice 
or very interesting.  Also prefer to avoid far reaches of upper east or west 
sides.

Thanks for your note.  Of the three you have listed, #1643 is probably a bit 
far from public transport for me.  #1671 is convenient to the business I have 
on Mon. & Tues. (what is Double SS?).  #1966 sounds like a fun location.  I'd 
be willing to spend more for a place that is particularly well furnished or 
interesting (any loft spaces?).

I have spoken with Daivd Mitchell about the issue that I raised in my e-mail 
yesterday regarding which law would govern the "perfection" of our interest 
Peter, 
As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our 
benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash 
as collateral.  In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you 
and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such 
cash.  I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context 
involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such 
cash proceeds are property of the estate.

Let me know what you think.  My assistant is trying to set up a call with 
you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised 
in my e-mail to you yesterday.

It's been long enough since I spent any time in the city that I don't really

Just something to keep in mind as you are evaluating your investments:

The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generation
to the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse,
the best strategy is to dismount.

However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors to
be taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be tried
with dead horses, including the following:

     1.   Buying a stronger whip.
     2.   Changing riders.
     3.   Threatening the horse with termination.
     4.   Appointing a committee to study the horse.
     5.   Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.
     6.   Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.
     7.   Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse.
     8.   Creating a training session to increase the riders load share.
     9.   Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.
     10.  Change the form so that it reads: "This horse is not dead."
     11.  Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.
     12.  Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.
     13.  Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting
          its full original cost.
     14.  Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.
     15.  Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would
          improve productivity.
     16.  Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.
     17.  Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs
          better.
     18.  Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.
     19.  Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.
     20.  Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.

Thanks for your note - hope you have time for a little fun while you're in SF 
- or at least some good food.

The Moorings said they should be able to put your part on the credit card if 
you want.  Their number is 800-535-7289; our contract number is 507645 and 
it's under my name.  The guy I talked to said he'll have to call during 
regular business hours when the bookkeeping department is open.  Each 
person's share is currently $905.33.  That includes one night in the Moorings 
hotel so will go down by 55.50 or so if you decide not to stay there at all.  
Beverages are covered by a separate payment.  I'll be glad to fax the invoice 
when you get a number for me.  If you want to send me your check, that's 
fine, or Bruce can do it - makes no difference to me.

Regarding "connectedness,"  there were no internet cafes the last time I was 
there.  While that may have changed, there won't be more than one or two in 
the entire place, I'm sure.  Were you planning on bringing your laptop?  If 
so, it would make sense to find a 12 volt charger cable that will plug into a 
lighter socket or bring extra batteries - we won't have 110 volt current on 
the boat except the first - and maybe one other - night.  It will be easy to 
check voice mails since we will have a cell phone on board.  But it's not 
cheap (as I remember it it was $1/min. to receive a call from the States and 
$2/min. to place one) and I'm reasonably comfortable that you won't be able 
to plug into it.  I'm not sure if your US cell phone will work there or not.  
We can find out from the Moorings.  I have an international cell phone I'm 
bringing along that also has infrared capability.  Does your laptop have one 
of those ir receivers?  If so, I can bring along the software you need to 
work it with this phone.  Not to be defeatist and I'm sure the times have 
changed but I remember one trip 7 or 8 years ago where a friend needed to 
receive & send some faxes so we stopped at a little island hotel and asked if 
we could use their fax machine - they said yes but had never seen anyone send 
or receive more than a 2 or 3 page fax before and our 50 and 60 pagers soon 
ran the machine out of paper.  When we asked for more paper it turns out we 
had used the last piece on the island - they were not amused.  

Ted asked me to remind you to be thinking about music.  Let me just add in 
the spirit of self-preservation that it's a good idea.  It's not safe to 
ignore this issue since if we leave him to his own devices we may not hear 
much other than Van Halen and Iron Maiden.  Obviously feel free to bring as 
many of your own cd's as you want & if you let us know what types of tunes 
you like we'll try and bring ours (if any) that match.  Don't worry too much 
about Ted's taste - I always insist that he bring along a Walkman & 
headphones!

Glad to hear the company is doing well, but just in case you need some ideas 
with some of your projects, I got this from a friend this morning:

This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit 
provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the 
ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a 
letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade 
governed by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).  What do 
you think about Edmund's solution?

Mark
Edmund Cooper
10/20/99 12:08 PM
Dear Jeff and Mark,

Justin and I have been discussing the way we should approach variation of the 
ETA in respect of counterparties with whom we have an existing master 
agreement, but for whom we want to have transactions governed by the 
applicable GTC for the product in question.

The initial plan was to issue a letter to the counterparty asking it to sign 
and return a letter agreement which would vary the provision of ETA which 
states that a master agreement will govern all transactions.  We have now 
reformulated our position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will 
simply be sent to the relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to 
sign and return any documents.

We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the 
ETA by stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL 
system will mean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master 
agreement.  We do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the 
ETA.  Obviously for this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented 
with the 'Accept GTC' button at the usual juncture in the system. 

In addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating 
that we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the 
credit provisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty 
accept the GTC over the master!!).

Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.  I 
also presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in 
this way will be effective under New York law. 

Best regards,

Edmund.

     12.  Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.
     13.  Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting
          its full original cost.
     14.  Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.
     15.  Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would
          improve productivity.
     16.  Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.
     17.  Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs
          better.
     18.  Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.
     19.  Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.
     20.  Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.

There is no organized transport to the Woodlands but it will be easy to make 
arrangements for you to ride with someone else leaving from the office - so I 
guess it makes sense for you to come in Thursday morning as well.  I'll try 
and set up a few meetings for you starting with lunch on Wednesday.  I was 
thinking primarily of lawyers here - anyone in particular you would like on 
the list?

Has Enron arranged transportation to the Woodlands?   If so could you let me

Dear All,

Following Mark's and David's request for the due diligence questionnaires 
that we have used in Europe for EOL, I am pleased to attach the following:

1. Questionnaire regarding internet trading
2. Questionnaire regarding commodity derivatives trading

A couple of points I'd like to make:

- the internet questionnaire refers to the European Economic Area "passport" 
(entitling you to trade in one EEA country by vitue of being regulated by 
another EEA country). Obviously this is not appropriate for S. America or 
Oceania and Asia. It is possible that you have some similar mechanism.
- the energy commodity questionnaire considers commodity derivatives trading. 
This questionniare was only sent to local counsel in jurisdictions for which 
we had not already undertaken derivatives due diligence.  In respect of 
physical commodity trading, based on the due diligence we have done to date 
in Europe, we have not undertaken any further due diligence for trading via 
EOL. If you feel that you need to undertake any physical trading due 
diligence, we have a set of questionnaires which I would be happy to pass on 
to you to use as you see fit.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries or questions about any 
of the above - otherwise, happy hunting!

Best regards, Edmund.

Can you guys please send over a copy of the questions that were submitted to 
local counsel in Europe relating to the online trading project?  Alan needs 
it for Australia and Louise has asked me to deal with Columbia.

Thanks,

Mark

Would you be available to take Andrea Calo to dinner next Wednesday (the 
night before the Legal Conference)?  She is coming in a day early to meet & 
chat with people here.

As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force 
covering a particular transaction, the master controls.  I don't think we 
ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.  For 
example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA, 
that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.  
However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that 
way.  They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single 
Enron entity (e.g. all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless 
of what master agreements are in place.  To resolve this I suggest that the 
long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each 
product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the 
ETA be revised as follows:

revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions 
are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product 
"...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity 
trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of 
the execution of such Transaction..."

(underlined text inserted) 

I think this will please the commercial and tax people; any thoughts from the 
legal side?

I'm afraid I may never have called you back on this one - do we still need to 
discuss?

David Forster

Mark,

Please call me re: verbatim use of wording between EOL and Confirms.

Also:

PCGs are checking back with confirms people regarding index descriptions and 
location, to make sure things are properly covered off. They are also going 
through the descriptions to identify cases where traders have grabbed 
incorrect items against the products they have created. Additional system 
controls are going in today and into next week to stop this sort of error 
from happening.

Hi Mark,  this is an email that I recieved from Lisa Gillette, who is a 
member of Product Control and is in charge of the Customer Registration 
Process.   In reviewing this process, I think this is a concern that truly 
falls in your realm.  Please review and get back to Lisa or myself.

"There seems to be some concern abou the Customer Registration from.  As of 
right now the Registration Form does not include a "State or Country of 
Incorporation" and needed to know if the form should be amended to include 
one.  Please let me know either directly or via Carrie Southard if this is 
something that we need to take care of."

Thank you,

Elizabeth and Leslie:
Enclosed is the setoff langauge that we put into our financial master 
agreements.  Most of our counterparties agree to this, but from our "utility" 
counterparties we consistently get the comment that from a regulatory 
standpoint, they cannot agree to the "Affiliate" lnaguage that is in here 
which I have highlighted.   Does this sound plausible to you and if so, why?  
Are there some utilility counterparties that could agree to this?

Here is Sullivan & Cromwell's reply.
If the PA and ETA are still structured as they were when I last saw them, the 
PA (which will be manually signed) binds the counterparty to the ETA and the 
ETA says that transactions will be governed by a master agreement, if any, or 
GTCs, if no master.  Assuming that is still the case, it seems to me that a 
letter sent to the counterparty, but not signed by it, will likely not 
override the PA and ETA already agreed to.  This seems particularly 
problematic if the reason for trying to override the ETA is to take advantage 
of better credit terms in the GTCs.  It seems to me that we would be better 
off either changing the ETA or supplementing it on-line; that way, we would 
at least have a click agreement, which the counterparty has agreed to be 
bound by.  Perhaps we should discuss further.  Thanks.

>>> "Mark Taylor" <mtaylo1@ect.enron.com> 10/21 11:34 AM >>>

This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit
provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the
ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a
letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade 
governed
by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).  What do you think
about Edmund's solution?

Mark
Edmund Cooper
10/20/99 12:08 PM

Dear Jeff and Mark,

Justin and I have been discussing the way we should approach variation of the
ETA in respect of counterparties with whom we have an existing master 
agreement,
but for whom we want to have transactions governed by the applicable GTC for 
the
product in question.

The initial plan was to issue a letter to the counterparty asking it to sign 
and
return a letter agreement which would vary the provision of ETA which states
that a master agreement will govern all transactions.  We have now 
reformulated
our position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will simply be sent 
to
the relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to sign and return 
any
documents.

We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the ETA
by stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL system 
will
mean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master agreement.  We
do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the ETA.  Obviously
for this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented with the 'Accept
GTC' button at the usual juncture in the system.

In addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating that
we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the credit
provisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty accept
the GTC over the master!!).

Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.  I 
also
presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in this way
will be effective under New York law.

Best regards,

Edmund.

(2)  Fundamentals of Corporate Finance on  December 2

Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Transacting  Question 4 - last line "accepted or rejected immediately upon 
receipt by the EnronOnline system" or "accepted or rejected by the 
EnronOnline system immediately upon receipt."  
  Question 5 - similar comment - build in concept of processing immediately 
upon receipt by the system.
  Question 9 - Can the Master User give others Master User privileges or can 
traders within a company view each other's transactions if the Master User 
authorizes it?  If so, deleat Back Office User and substitute "and others 
authorized by your Master User".  If not, is it possible there will be more 
than one Back Office User?  I so, insert (s).

Products  Question 6 - last line "at the best price available on the 
EnronOnline system (if it is within the range you specify)"

Registration  Question 13 - still needs an answer.  Should it also apply to 
trader user ID's & passwords?

Legal   Question 3 - Password Application,not Agreement;  "framework for 
transactions carried out"

Earnings Related Questions - Will these be posted for all to see?  If so, we 
should have a Corp. lawyer look these over (SEC concerns).  These seem more 
appropriate as answers for PR and IR to have ready in case anyone asks. 

You will no doubt recognize that I have exercised the utmost restraint - 
contrary to my every lawerly instinct - in commenting only on provisions that 
were identified as current changes.

What was this one about?

Elena/Mark: Please coordinate as necessary to reintroduce the <31, >31 day 
split for U.S. Gas. This means that U.S. Gas Product Types will now be 
differentiated based on location (Inside/Outside Texas) and tenor (<31/>31 
days). Please amend the MPS and the database as required. Obviously, we would 
like for these changes to be accomplished soon, so we can put all this stuff 
to bed.

Plese print these out for the CFTC file.

Attached for your information are the final thank you letters (with Kevin's

I'm most concerned about the internet aspect of things now - this is new 
advice we are requesting and I would not expect it to be the lion's share of 
the expense - presumably the update portion will be relatively easy.

   

Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's 
legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.  You have 
already authorized payment of the bill.  The fax requesting an update from 
Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.  What would you like to do?

Master Agreements will cover trades with that entity only.

   

How did we ever resolve the two signed masters situation for Elf Trading S.A.

Don't forget the first session of the Conference begins at 1:00 tomorrow

Thanks for spelling it out for me.  I WILL be in NYC this weekend and, while 
I have done it before and found it to be all you describe, would enjoy going 
to the parade with you.  As I remember it, the trick to limiting the 
aggravating and full of people factor is deciding where to watch and when to 
be there.   The embarrassment factor is significantly reduced by refusing to 
participate in the actual parade oneself and not knowing any participants (or 
at least not acknowledging them as they pass).  Do you have the time and 
route?  Maybe we can grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby.

As far as getting in the mood goes, try http://www.bviwelcome.com/ (I should 
know how to make that a link but I don't).

I'll definitely bring the cruising guide and a map if I can find it.  None of 
the videos I have is right on point (either the wrong size boat is involved 
or they're too advanced) but I'll bring them along anyway.  I have mixed 
feelings about bringing  Heavy Weather Sailing - I don't want to 
unnecessarily alarm anyone but we do want G to go to the doctor for the 
Transderm Scop patch!

Feel free to bring anything to get us in the mood!

The question, Mark, was did you mean you were in NYC this weekend?  G seemed
to feel something else was meant and I am not one to argue.  This weeked has
the parade in the village, which could be fun, embarrassing or just
aggravating and full of people, but I think I am going for a look-see. So if
you are around and not feeling that you have done it all in the past, then
we should meet up (provided, of course that your email meant that you were
in NYC this w/end) and we can chat some BVI.  It would be nice to see you,
in any event.

Below please find my policy draft for confirm generation guidelines.  As I 
would ultimately like for someone from legal to officially sign off on 
something like this, please review with that in mind.  Thanks very much.  
Please call  me if you have questions or comments.  

"All FX deals are to be verbally confirmed as soon as possible after the 
trade is executed.   A comment should be written on the deal ticket noting 
who the deal was confirmed with and the date and time.  Once a deal has been 
verbally confirmed, and entered into TAGG, deals with an expiration within 
one week of the trade date should be sent to the file room.  If the deal has 
settlements beyond one week from  the trade date, a confirmation should be 
generated based on the template for that particular counterparty.  All 
intercompany deals should be paper confirmed.  

In the event that we are unable to verbally confirm a transaction by the end 
of trade date + one, a written confirmation should be generated and sent to 
the counterparty.    

Any discrepancies noted when verbally confirming should be brought to the 
traders attention."

Thanks.  LEt me know what you think.

In the build up to bringing Australia onto the EnronOnline system with a 
start date of 1st February 2000, I have outlined a kick off plan as a 
suggestion.

The initial work we have done covers the areas outlined belowbearing mind I 
may have missed a few things out.  In order to kick things off I suggest we 
concentrate on the background areas which predominantly will be run by 
legal.  The teams involved in the project so far include the US and Europe - 
where the jurisdictional issues have all been handled are listed at the 
bottom of this note for information but I am to a certain extent assuming 
that legal is run from the US rather than Europe for Australia (I have left a 
voicemail with Alan Aronowitz to chat it through with him).  I would like 
Mark to co-ordinate the work with David and start off immediately - please 
let me know if there are nay problems with this.  From my group Dave Forster 
and myself will be points of contact at this stage bringing in more resources 
as soon as we get the background things rolling.

But firstly we need an idea of what will be traded in Australia, from our 
discussions I am assuming Power, Coal and Weather - is that right?

Background:
(i)  Due diligence from a regulatory perspective
(ii)  Legal review on the framework of our site in its appropriateness to the 
market .
 (i) Drafting of the password application agreements in line with the market
 (ii) Drafting of the electronic trading agreement in line with the market
(iii)  Redrafting of the GTCs to incorporate language to cover web 
transactions.
(iv)  Complete tax review.

Commodities:
(i)  Review with Traders on the products they are to offer
(ii)  Production of short description of each product for publication on the 
web-site quotes page
(iii) Production of long description to be accessed by clicking on the short 
description
(iv)  Trader training on the Stack Manager
(v)  Trader training on the Product Manager
(vi) Trader/originator  training on the Web-site

Customers:
(i)  Collation of customers to be send a marketing pack including password 
application form
(ii)  Credit to process customers to set up the credit limits per product for 
each customer and the appropriate form of GTC profile to be embedded in the  
system.
(iii)  Tax to approve customer profile 
(iv)  Legal to associate customers with any Master Agreements in place.

Support:
(i) Integration of EOL in risk systems
(ii)  Daily data management of traders/customers
(ii)  Maintenance of system

Technical:  
(i)  Bandwidth - Arshak Sarkissian is apparently rolling out bandwidth at the 
current time between Sydney and Singapore to close the link around the  world 
(ie we loop the world).  Between Houston and Sydney we now have 128k line 
which will be increased (approximately doubling the capacity) -  we will 
fortunately have the experience of EnronOnline going live before then to know 
if that will be enough.  Arshak can get a T1 if required in  approximately 
60/80 days.

In order to kick things off I suggest we concentrate on the background areas 
which predominantly will be run by legal.  The teams involved in the project 
so far include (I have left a voicemail with Alan Aronowitz to chat it 
through with him).  But firstly we need an idea of what will be traded in 
Australia, from our discussions I am assuming Power, Coal and Weather - is

28Sep1999 AUSTRALIA: Computers - Power supplier seeks vital spark on net. 
By Mandy Bryan.
e-Strategy

As electricity retailers prepare for deregulation, Ergon Energy chief Kim 
Griffith is looking to the internet for competitive advantage.
Around this time next year, NSW and Victorian consumers will be able to 
choose their own electricity suppliers, ushering in a period of massive 
change for Australia's 30 electricity retailers.
Among them will be Queensland's Ergon Energy, which now services 550,000 
customers and earns 50 per cent of its revenue from the consumer market.
Ergon chief executive Kim Griffith has chosen to make the internet a key part 
of his survival plan as he jostles for mind share.
"There really isn't an established way of doing this because electricity has 
always been a monopoly and suddenly 10 million contestible customers will 
appear in an industry that is probably turning over $10 billion in sales a 
year," he says.
While studies show Australian utilities are lagging behind overseas 
counterparts in moving operations online, Ergon Energy is considered to be at 
the forefront of internet adoption by an Australian utility.
Ergon's website allows customers to connect and disconnect their electricity 
service and submit complaints and enquiries.
"If you look at electricity retail, it is fundamentally an information-based 
business and we will survive based on the information we can gather about 
customers," says Griffith.
He also hopes that by 2001 customers will also be able to pay their bills and 
select from more flexible pricing billing arrangements, as well as buy 
products and services online.
"The internet is an obvious way of doing business because it also allows you 
to increase interaction with customers at an appropriate cost. We are now 
selling a commodity with low margins, so a cost-effective channel to market 
is key."
The $3 to $4 cost of over-the-counter transactions is more than 10 times the 
cost of an internet transaction, Griffith says.
As electricity margins shrink, he says Ergon will increasingly diversify into 
non-electricity and electricity-related services and products.
"We are looking to add value and differentiate in areas other than price. We 
are releasing a number of products into our domestic market related to 
electricity and electricity consumption such as energy-efficient light 
bulbs," he says.
"The next big challenge I've put to my people is to put significant product 
on to the site and to generate real revenue."
But he acknowledges that winning in this market is not as simple as being 
first on the web.
Ergon faces competition not only from traditional electricity retailers but 
also nimble virtual electricity brokers such as Exco Energy (www.exco.com.au) 
and possibly banks and supermarkets. Woolworths, for instance, has flagged an 
interest in electricity retailing.
Yet Griffith believes that these same organisations also present 
opportunities to utilities given the reach of their established customer 
bases.
"If you look at electricity, and particularly the mass market, there really 
isn't a channel to market," Griffith says. "In the future, companies will be 
out there trying to create national brands as well as looking to alliances 
with established brands and channels to markets."
In addition to seeking such alliances, Ergon is building up its own customer 
database to hold and analyse the information it gathers from its website.
"Each time a customer hits our website, we can gather more information and 
continue to build business based on that information."
For the time being, though, the major challenge lies in drawing people to its 
site.
"We are offering a number of freebies on our site to get people used to 
visiting it," he says.
Ergon also has comprehensive educational information on its site relevant to 
the school curriculum which it is building up into a full virtual power 
station tour.
"If we want people to keep visiting, we have to keep increasing the value of 
the site to existing and potential customers," Griffith says.
"There are two groups, the ones that will not want to change suppliers in 
2001 and those that do, and they are the people who will be on board with 
technology."

Awais,

From a Pan-European law perspective, the PAs can be signed and faxed to 
Enron. And when the PA is then signed by Enron, it can be faxed back to the 
customer.  We therefore do not require the original of the PA.  [N.B. But do 
check with Mark Taylor for the position under US law.]

However, some customers may feel more comfortable in having the choice of 
returning the PA by mail instead of by fax - in the light of this, you may 
wish to give them this choice.

Justin

Justin a little teaser for you.  Can PA's be faxed in?  I have out 
instructionla copy saying thta Customers should complete the Registration 
form and PA and then either mail or fax to us.  I presume we do not need the 
original signed copy do we?

If so I will need to chnage the text on the registration page.  The 
registration process is up on www.enrononline.com by the way now.  Take a 
look.

I belieev all this text was already approved by legal and so shoudl be Ok.

Mark,

I'm not sure how you want to handle changes to the FAQ's going forward from a 
legal approval standpoint. Shall we continue to send you all new 
questions/answers?

In addition to the FAQ's sent to you last week, we also have the following:

1. Is EnronOnline wholesale only, or does it do retail?

EnronOnline is not intended for available to retail customers sales at this 
point time.

2. What kind of technology does EnronOnline use behind the applications?

The EnronOnline system uses various technologies to deliver the final product 
site to your screen. This includes an Oracle database, weblogic servers, 
Macromedia Shockwave, HTML, Java and Secure Socket Layer (SSL), among others.

3. What is the minimum size or price which can be transacted on EnronOnline?

The minimum and maximum size is different for each product and is specified 
by the Enron trader who is responsible for that product.  It may vary from 
time to time.  There are no minimum price levels.
[It strikes me that there are minimum price levels (for sales by Enron) and 
maximum price levels (for purchases).]

Thanks,

Dave

Lucy:

Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity 
should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties.  
There are a couple of general rules that apply to "normal" trading 
circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not 
hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances 
vary (even just a little bit) from "normal."  For example, abnormal 
situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another 
transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), 
the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain 
Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron 
company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we 
are trading (except as spelled out below).  Having said all that, the 
following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:

1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an 
Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron 
company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is 
concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, 
Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.  Of 
course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, 
Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where 
derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or 
can't be done by us from the U.S.).

2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or 
Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should 
be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to 
the master agreement.  If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other 
rules may apply.  

3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT 
International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is 
in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on 
behalf of ECT International.  Note that there are special considerations if 
the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is 
actually "arranged" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT 
International).  If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or 
U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two 
countries for final negotiation and execution.  It would be a good idea to 
consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice.  

These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal 
counterparty to the transactions.  This doesn't determine where within the 
Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.  If we want the risk 
to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual 
purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) 
to get the risk in the right place.

Looks good to me.

Thanks for the joke - it's getting lots of laughs!

Tana forwarded the following message on to me since she will be out of the 
office for the next week or so. 

We are not familiar with any of these companies or their activities or 
operations.  You might want to check with Kate Cole's office to see what she 
knows.

Please note that each of the following companies will be a new controller of 
EEFT as a result of the reorg:

Enron Power Trading Limited (UK)
Enron Europe Limited (UK)
Enron Europe LLC (US)
Enron Power Corp (US)
Enron Europe Inc  (US) - the new US holding company.

For each company we will need to find out the following info which will need 
to be notified to SFA:

1. Principal activities

2.  Date and place of incorporation and registered number

3.  Names of directors and their dates of birth

4.  Address of head/principal office and telephone number

5.  Regulatory Authorities or Exchanges in the UK or overseas of which the 
entity is or has been a member.

Most of this info is pretty basic, but I suspect 1 &5 could be slightly 
tricky (for 1 we only need to list the principal activity or activities).

Lin, Kate and Tana: 2 of these entities are UK and 3 US incorporated. I'd be 
very grateful if you would assist Edmund in putting this information 
together. It will need to be filed with SFA (the UK regulator) at the 
beginning of next week.

Many thanks in advance for your assistance

Many thanks and kind regards,

I sent Dave comments on his last three additions yesterday and on the full

I just received notice that the Senate Bankruptcy Bill (S. 625) will be on 
the Senate floor around 3:00 pm today.  
As of a meeting I had yesterday afternoon, all of our issues look like 
they're in good shape.

Just to re-cap for everyone: 

1)  DOI proposal on oil & gas leasing -- will not be in managers' amendment 
and should not be offered on the floor.
2)  Enron's techincal correction on production payments -- is safely in the 
bill and will pass if the whole bill passes.
3)  Enron's additions/changes on derivatives language -- should be inserted 
at Senator Nickles' behest into the managers' amendment before the bill goes 
to the floor this afternoon...will get confirmation soon.

I'll be in touch shortly with updates.....

Looks like we had our first registration form in today from a company called 
Projector S.A. with a rep office in Singapore and trading out of Belize. 
Nice one for the Credit Tax and Legal bunnies....

Would it work if we picked you up in the USVI?  I know it's possible to fly 
into St. Thomas either directly from New York or through San Juan and you 
could take a ferry to St. John (still part o the USVI) where we could pick 
you up.  It's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the US 
and then back to the BVI but I've done it a couple of times before.  The 
timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to St. John 
before the afternoon of the 22nd.  If you're nervous about sailing into the 
BVI, we could stick around St. John for a few days.  You might check the 
cruising guide & see what it says about the US side of things - places to 
go/anchor, etc.

Looks like this one is for me to review.  They will be sending these to all 
of us so that whenever one of us is out, we can let the others know to 
forward these on to whomever is appropriate.  We're supposed to get back to 
them within 24 hours.

Bummer - I had no idea the USVI wasn't considered part of the US - I'm 
assuming when you say "on the way back in" you mean from the USVI to the 
mainland since we could try to arrange things to avoid going back to the BVI 
while you were with us if that made a difference.

I don't have any leads on a possible stand-in, but don't really want one 
either since we've our hearts set on YOU.    Hopefully the lawyer can figure 
out a way to speed things up.  As a last resort, maybe we should check with 
Greg for a replacement since that's who he'll have to bunk with.  You have to 
be reasonably careful about such choices since you will be spending your 
holiday in pretty close contact with them.   It may also be a bit late to 
find transport to that part of the world; any hope of transferring the ticket 
in your name to someone else?

Mark

I have just spoken with my lawyer.  Basically, USVI does not work.  I could
be easily "carded" on the way back in.  Apparently, it is well tried and
therefore well patrolled way of entry into the US.

We are going to try and get INS to speed the process, but basically I am in
a difficult position.  I no longer have the first job under which the first
application was submitted, so I cannot call and say I need the travel permit
for business reasons, and although my cheques have been cashed (I think) the
travel permit is delayed somewhere.  I have no news at all on the second
application.

Do you know of anyone that you may want to take along instead?  One or two
spots going....whichever is easiest to fill.

game (7:30 start).  Section 125, Row G.

Susan:

This is not urgent, but when you have a minute, please check and see what 
research we have done with local counsel in the Czech Republic.  I'm 
wondering in particular if they were part of our survey regarding European 
derivatives law.

Yesterday we concluded two new short term swap deals with two separate 
Continental counterparties. The details are:

Light Fuel Oil (Rheinscheine) swap with M.V.V, a large German municipality. 
Enron pays floating.
Brent Oil swap with MND, a Czech oil & gas producer. Enron pays fixed. (This 
trade was done under an ISDA Master we have with MND)

Although the volumes in each case are not large, these trades are with 
significant counterparties.

Do you have time to compare this opinion to our current form?  Justin tells 
me he started from a form that was a year or more old.
Justin Boyd
11/05/99 08:10 AM
Mark,

I attach a draft form of internal ECT legal opinion that we are proposing to 
offer SWD, a counterparty with whom we are seeking to enter into a Master 
Swap Agreement. 

The impasse to date had been SWD's unwillingness to agree on the content of 
the external (V&E) legal opinion we were offering.  After considerable 
debate, SWD instead agreed to obtain their own form of external opinion (from 
Linklaters). 

In terms of the ECT legal opinion, the changes shown represent deviations 
from our standard form of opinion (as of August last year).  Would be 
grateful for your views at to whether these would be acceptable from Mark 
Haedicke's point of view, and also taking into account any changes that may 
have occurred in the meantime.  John Thompson (who heads up the Frankfurt 
office) would execute the Master, and I have already arranged for the 
appropriate corporate authorisation from Enron Europe Finance & Trading 
Limited.

One sticking point has been SWD's demand that the opinion given under 
paragraph 4 ("No authorizations, consents, etc.....") should also apply to 
SWD; this would seem unacceptable to me.

[Please note that we intend that Jim Derrick would give a legal opinion 
relating to the Guaranty.]

Regards and thanks

Justin

I will give you a call to discuss.

When you get a chance, have a quick read.  John got approval on Wednesday 
from Skilling and Whalley to move forward quickly.  We have committed to 
quoting on 200 reference credits, in 6 countries using Enron Online by 15 
Jan.   As we intend to quote two-way prices on your biggest customers, in 
addition to everyone else, I want to make sure that we evaluate all of the 
implications.

Martin Rosell
11/09/99 09:47 AM
Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Martin

Here's the current forecast for Lenny.  Shouldn't be  a major problem for us 
but I feel for folks scheduled to go down there tomorrow and Thursday.

Bruce - we're still keeping our fingers crossed that your permit will come 
through.  Are you sure you've got the right lawyer working on this?  Seems 
like he ought to be able to shake it loose somehow.  Anything at all we can 
do from here?

The Moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better 
idea about the storm situation - they canceled all of their charter starts 
for today & tomorrow (no surprise) and she expected Thursday's to cancel 
also.  They still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but 
they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and Saturday.  
They were able to confirm a room for you for Sunday the 28th (the day we have 
to bring the boat back).  I'll let you know what happens when I get through 
to them tomorrow.

Mark

David - We'r trying to get through to you on the phone but can't get across

Just for your background info, the other reason we use deemed ISDAs on the 
interest rate & currency deals is that the omnibus was really drafted with 
commodity deals in mind.  I'd have to go back and look at it to see if it 
would work at all for an interest rate or currency deal.  Do you think I 
should do that?  Hopefully not or at least not til after 1/1.

   

With respect to your request for a Deemed ISDA Confirm for the referenced 
counterparty, I checked with Yao, our paper guru, and he said there is no 
special reason or precedence for using the Deemed ISDA confirmations for the 
paper boys (unless maybe if they did a really long-dated trade).  He said we 
could go ahead and use the omnibus.  Just because we hope to sign an ISDA, 
doesn't necessarily mean we use the Deemed ISDA confirmations.  In practice, 
we tend to use the Deemed ISDA's for international counterparties, for the 
interest rate and currency desk (because a lot of their counterparties are 
banks and dealers and more familiar with the ISDA's, unlike our energy 
counterparties).

Call me with any questions...

David - as to your point 2, we have used the "Deemed ISDA" appraoch for 
weather derivatives.  I see no reason we can't do something similar in 
Australia for power.  I've atached an example (but I'm not sure it is 
thefinal version).

As you are aware, we are in the middle of the VP Performance Review Cycle.  
On instructions from the Office of the Chair,  VP's and above will be 
measured principally on the Skills/Behaviors criterion.  This will also be 
supplemented by two additional indicators:

Providing Feedback to Staff
Participation in Recruiting efforts for Enron programs

Critical to the item "Providing Feedback to Staff" is your involvement in 
collecting this data.  Attached is a form that should be distributed to all 
your direct reports regarding this item.  The instructions ask the direct 
reports to send this information back to me.  I will collate the data and 
this will be available for use at both the December ENA Executive Review 
Meeting on December 14, and  the January 5-6 Enron Executive Meeting.  

Again, your involvement in helping me collect this data is critical to the 
success.  Please contact me at Ext 30649 if you have any further questions.  

It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling to the 
USVI; since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI I 
wouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or 
Puerto Rico.  We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be 
an exploratory trip for us - not at all a bad thing.  We can't get the boat 
to the USVI till Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's 
tons of work getting all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).  Best bet is to 
pick Bruce up in St. John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a 
large, busy commercial port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with 
the cruise ships (not fun).  There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas 
to St. John.  We won't be there before noon on Monday.

I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the right thing 
here!

OK...guys the story is this:

I have just spent the entire day at Federal Plaza with the INS in extremely
nasty conditions.  Basically, I was not able to get hold of a travel permit.
Vermont apparently has lost my documents including travel permit and Federal
Plaza cannot step in.  I cannot drive to Vermont, because they only do
postal.  I think I would feel slightly better had I known the outcome at the
start of the day rather than at the end.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, I asked the question of whether I could
goto the US Virgin Islands.  The first answer was "no", so I persisted and
the second answer was "yes; can I point you to the US in the US Virgin
Islands", so feeling very patronised but having achieved something for my
day at Federal Plaza I left.

We now have 3 choices:

1.    Go to US VI......I definitely cannot go to BVI
2.    Delay flight a couple of days and hope that travel permit comes
through (which it should because my lawyer)
3.    Got to USVI and get permit sent on if it comes through

G:  Please can you see about changing my flights to the US VI.  You are
better at dealing with airlines than I am.....pretty please!

Bruce - I just had another thought (they come so rarely I feel a need to pass 
them along as soon as it happens).  The Full Moon party we discussed before 
is on Nov. 23.  Unfortunately it is in the BVI.  If your lawyer can get the 
permit by Monday and Fed Ex it to us, we could still get over there (Bomba's 
Shack is on the western end of Tortola - reasonably close to the USVI).  The 
boat will have a cell phone but we won't have a number till Sunday at the 
earliest.  Be sure to bring the lawyer's number so we can call him Monday.

Mark

P.S.  -  My sympathies on your day at Federal Plaza.  My imagination isn't up 
to the task of conjuring how miserable that must have been. 

Yes - and boats.  I wasn't too worried until the last update which indicates 
the storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there - just 
barely east of due south of the BVI.  They are predicting that it will resume 
its course in the morning and I sure hope so but anything can happen.  As of 
the middle of this afternoon, the Moorings was planning to let the Friday 
charter starts go for sure - maybe even tomorrow's!

AA is fine - St Thomas.  All we need to do now is make sure there are
islands left to fly into.

Thanks,

Greg

Recently, you requested Jim provide written feedback on David.  
Unfortunately, due to the large number of requests received, Jim is unable to

You have to be careful reading those reports - the 145mph number is the 
current maximum wind speed - right at the eye wall - which is well to the 
south-east of St. Thomas.  The Weather channel this morning showed local 
radar indicating a lot of rain in the US 7 BVI but the storm center was 
pretty far away.  The real question is what direction will it go from here.  
If it heads out to the north east as predicted, no problems.  If it takes a 
turn to the north, direct hit.  I hadn't hard about the state of emergency 
but that could be due to rain related damage.

Many storm sites available:
http://www.atwc.org/

isory.html
http://www.usatoday.com/weather/huricane/1999/atlantic/wstorm1.htm
http://www.weather.com/weather_center/

In case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates, the BVI is at 
roughly 18 25' N 64 40' W
St. Thomas is closer to 18 20' N 65 W

Check the weather reports.

USVI badly hit by hurricane Lenny....145mph winds......Clinton thinking of
declaring a state of emergency.

Interesting damage reports - particularly from St. Croix.  I had been looking 
at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be 
able to poke around in the USVI.  I seem to remember that the Moorings won't 
let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might 
want to get special permission.  Now I'm not so sure if the place will still 
be all ahoo when we get there.  It might not have been the entire group's cup 
of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way 
to and from St. John.  My impression is that I might be the only soul on 
board who would relish that thought - particularly if the seas are still a 
bit rough from storm effects.  I'm watching the national Weather Service 
updates as they come out - roughly every two hours.

Caution on the Fed Ex package for the doorman - USVI may be the US for INS 
purposes but not for Fed Ex - they require an international waybill for 
deliveries there.  You can have the package sent to their Cruz Bay office to 
be held for pick-up (two day service - guaranteed by 4 pm) or to St. Thomas 
airport (next day service by 2 pm).  I mentioned in a previous note that the 
main harbor in St. Thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably 
figure out a way to get in there if that works out best (maybe go into a 
different bay, dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport).  Fed Ex - (800)

Good News:  Lenny weakening - max. winds down to 130 mph and pressure rising
Bad News:  The darn thing won't get moving - still just drifting a bit to the 
north & east

It's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps - they're all 
so small they almost don't show up on the maps.  Luckily St. Thomas is to the 
west and a bit north of Lenny's current position

Here is a San Juan radar image that has St. Thomas marked and one of th 
recent forecasted path maps.

Should I have received a copy already?  I don't remember seeing it.

I just got this update (emphasis added) - these coordinates put the storm 
just a tad south and a good (but not comfortable) bit east of St. Thomas & 
Tortola.  If it stays on this track, things will only improve in the VI.

The Moorings should be able to tell you how to get from the USVI to their

Soper's Hole) Tortola and then a cab to the base in Road Town or a ferry 
straight to Road Town.  I don't really know.  I'm also no help on how often 
they run or how long they take.  If you can be at the Moorings by 11 or 11:30

ENA and Enron Canada have agreed to transact these deals as physical deals

I may not understand the question, but Legal does not need to be informed of

Please confirm whether legal does or does not require Global to track 
contractual relationships with counterparties where an Electronic Trading 
Agreement exists but there are no Online GTC's.

Thank you,
Karen

Dale Neuner on 11/19/99 11:11:47 AM
I spoke to Mark Dilworth about our discussion re: Global Counterparty being 
notified via e-mail whenever a customer 'signs' an ETA or GTC. Mark seems to 
think that this methodology is rather difficult, and the liklihood of it 
being accomplished anytime soon is LOW.

There is a report that will be generated with each days trading that will 
identify who our Active customers are (meaning a User ID and Password has 
been issued). That report will give us that day's exposure; exposure meaning 
there was activity for that customer, for that day; no exposure meaning there 
was no activity for that customer, for that day. With activity we would know 
that an ETA had been signed, and then you could go in and see that the GTC 
had been signed off (should be simple, as the GTC would match the Product 
Type being traded). This report would identify new customers as they traded, 
but would not identify those customers that sign an ETA and do not do any 
trades.

Mark has agreed that our idea is certainly do-able for Phase 2.

My only concern is that the letter may not adequately tie the master 
agreement referred to and the products affected in a situation where we have 
more than one master (covering different commodities or transaction types) 
with the same counterparty.  I can imagine a situation where Credit doesn't 
want us to use a physical master but the financial master is ok or vice 
versa.  I mentioned this to Bob and he will watch for situations where Credit 
is only "turning off" one master in a multiple master setting.  We should 
also be listing each master affected if Credit wants to turn them all off.

Is this something you know anything about?

Michael Brown suggested I contact you on this.  I am SFA registered in the 
UK.  Can that be transferred to the US as a series 7 broker registration or 
something else similar??  I would appreciate your thoughts and help on this.

Thanks

As you know, I will be out of the office next week.  I will have the cell 
phone with me:

but unfortunately no way to recharge the thing after Sunday morning and no

that number and do not get an answer that you NOT leave a message there.  It 
will be much more likely to get to me if you leave it here at the office

The Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday, December 16 held a hearing on 
OTC Derivatives and the almost-demise of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) 
hedge fund.

Witnesses included:

Panel One:  CFTC Commissioners
Brooksley Born, Chair
John Tull
Barbara Holum
David Spears
James Newsome

Panel Two:  Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets, Staff
Roger Anderson, Treasury
Patrick Parkinson, Fed
Richard Lindsey, SEC
Daniel Waldman, CFTC

Panel Three:  Former CFTC Chairs
Susan Phillips
Wendy Gramm
William Albrecht
Martin Mayer

The only members of the Committee present were Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) 
and Ranking Member Tom Harkin (D-IA).  Thad Cochran (R-MS) stayed only to 
make a brief opening statement.

In his opening statement, Lugar announced that the Committee would hold 
hearings and "seminars" in 1999 on OTC Derivatives issues as part of 
Commodity Exchange Act re-authorization.  Lugar also announced that he would 
be releasing a set of questions for the Committee to consider in advance of 
next year's hearing.  (I will forward the questions as soon as I am able to 
obtain a copy from the Committee.)

CFTC PANEL:

1)  Chairperson Born - her testimony was essentially no different than what 
she's been saying since May when the Concept Release was published.  She 
focused her testimony mostly on the LTCM meltdown and did not really speak to 
the issue of the appropriateness of derivatives regulation by the CFTC.  She 
only continued to assert that the Concept Release raised necessary questions 
about the OTC market, and its issuance does not officially mean the CFTC will 
regulate, but was completely justified and did not cause legal uncertainty or 
risk in OTC markets.   

She said that the LTCM situation arose because of the use of derivatives in 
"highly speculative" activities.  LTCM had excessive margin obligations to 
futures exchanges, derivatives positions of $1.25 trillion (1000 times its 
capital), and carried excessive debt.   Born said that the Concept Release 
raises questions that go to the heart of the LTCM problem:  lack of 
transparency, excessive leverage, and (most notably) the lack of controls and 
reporting requirements that allow firms to take positions that jeopardise 
markets and avoid appropriate regulation.

She indicated a hope that the President's Working Group would complete its 
studies on OTC derivatives and on hedge funds early in 1999, and that the 
CFTC would work closely with other agencies toward that end.

2)  Commissioner Tull - echoed Born's testimony, saying that the LTCM 
situation raises questions about transparency, leverage, over-lending, 
disclosure, and systemic risk.  He said the Concept Release questions don't 
mean that regulation is required -- the responses will be important to the 
CFTC in dealing with situations like LTCM.

3)  Commissioner Holum - indicated that the CFTC should definitely not act 
until the President's Working Group (PWG) completes its studies on 
derivatives and hedge funds AND until Congress has evaluated the results of 
those studies and considered the issue fully in CEA re-authorization 
hearings.  She said CEA legislation is the appropriate forum for 
re-examination of OTC regulation.  She added that regulators shouldn't be 
able to hide behind interpretations of static old regulation, regulations 
must evolve with the markets.

Holum said the LTCM situation occurred due to excessive leverage, arising 
from a bad investment strategy and over-extension of credit by lenders.  The 
CFTC should not jump to regulation because of one firm's poor management, 
this could drive business offshore.   She also said that regulation of 
on-exchange markets should be examined along with OTC markets.

4)  Commissioner Spears - said that while the Concept Release was purported 
to be a "fact-finding" exercise, it shouldn't have been done in a "vacuum" 
without participation from the rest of the PWG agencies.  Congress should 
have a major role in the debate -- as such Spears and Commissioner Newsome 
have formally indicated that they will not vote for any new regulation until 
Congress has considered that matter, at least through September 1999.

5)  Commissioner Newsome -  he echoed Spears' remarks, saying that he 
wouldn't vote for any new regulation of OTC markets until Congress has fully 
considered the matter and the PWG has concluded its review and studies.  
(NOTE:  I had a chance to talk to Commissioner Newsome after the hearing, and 
he indicated that he would like to take Mark Haedicke up on his offer to 
visit the Enron Trading Floor.)

Questions and Answers:

-- Lugar indicated that the CFTC had information about LTCM's problems well 
before the September collapse (this was reported in the Washington Post).  He 
asked why they did not share this information with the PWG agencies or act 
sooner.  Born responded that LTCM (as a Commodity Pooling Organization - CPO) 
filed audited financial statements and satisfied all reporting requirements 
in filing the information that the CFTC received before September.  She said 
the commissioners never saw the information -- staff determined LTCM was OK 
at that point.  She also said other agencies had some of the same information 
at the same time.

--  Harkin asked the size of the OTC market -- his point being that it is 
unknown due to lack of transparency.  All commissioners indicated they had no 
formal answer, but the guess was around $30 trillion.   Harkin asked if there 
was double-counting going on based on the underlying assets on which 
derivatives are formed.  Born responded that there is not even necessarily an 
underlying asset involved, but yes, there could be multiple-counting.  
Harkin's comment was that this seemed to him like a "pyramid scheme," and 
raises serious questions about safety and soundness.  Harking then asked Born 
if imposing reporting requirements were within the CFTC's exemptive authority 
under the 1993 CEA?  Born replied simply, yes.

-- Lugar asked what expertise the CFTC has in analyzing the OTC market.  Born 
indicated that CFTC economists and attorneys "try to keep up with" OTC 
developments, but don't devote a lot of resources in that area because they 
have made so many exemptions for the OTC market.

PWG PANEL:

Testimony of all witnesses focused mainly on the relevance of the LTCM 
collapse in their two studies on derivatives and hedge funds.  They all 
indicated that the PWG was using a consensus process in their review -- no 
agency's view will be allowed to dominate the studies.  They also stressed 
the importance of looking at OTC markets as international markets, and 
coordinating with international regulatory bodies.

FORMER CFTC CHAIRS PANEL:

1)  Susan Phillips - Said that financial derivatives are easier to regulate 
than commodity derivatives.  (Note:  She seemed to assume in her testimony 
that the main participants in OTC markets were banks and financial services 
firms)  She said that the CEA gives the CFTC very broad authority to 
regulate, and Congress may want to take a fresh look at this.  She also said 
that, in addition to greater market discipline, the best way to deal with 
"unregulated" participants in OTC markets would be more adequate disclosure 
requirements.

2)  Wendy Gramm - was a superstar witness, advocating no further role for the 
CFTC or any other agency in OTC market regulation.  She said that by the 
CFTC's merely asking questions in 1987, the commodity swap market moved 
overseas and did not return until the CFTC issued more friendly policy 
statement and clarifications.  She introduced 2 articles into the record, one 
that focuses on the CFTC's creating legal uncertainty by asking questions 
about OTC markets, and another that says that regulators shouldn't use events 
such as LTCM to advance their own regulatory agenda.  She said that any 
purported regulations need strict review by Congress and cost/benefit 
analysis.

3)  William Albrecht - said there is no role for the CFTC in OTC markets.  He 
said that the CFTC shouldn't use the LTCM situation to stretch its regulatory 
authority to hedge funds.  He reluctantly proposed that the CFTC and SEC be 
merged, because functional regulation no longer appears to work well due to 
diversity of participants in the financial markets.

4)  Martin Mayer - said the CFTC should re-assert its role in derivatives 
regulation due to the recent LTCM situation.  He believes that any financial 
instrument that is a "bet" is a derivative - futures included.

Questions and Answers:

Chairman Lugar asked if OTC market regulation by the CFTC is appropriate.  
-- Phillips replied No, there may be a need for additional disclosure 
requirements, and may be an expanded role for the SEC in doing so.
-- Gramm replied No, and there is no need for nay expanded regulation -- the 
authority should not move to another agency, institutional regulation is 
sufficient.
-- Albrecht replied No, it is too complex and difficult to structure 
functional regulation of derivatives under the CEA.
-- Mayer replied Yes.

FORMER CFTC CHAIRS PANEL

As you know, I will be out of the office next week.  I will have the cell 
phone with me:

   011 44 7881 512 535

but unfortunately no way to recharge the thing after Sunday morning and no 
guarantee that it works in the Virgin Islands anyway.  I suggest that if you 
try that number and do not get an answer that you NOT leave a message there.  
It will be much more likely to get to me if you leave it here at the office 
(x37459).

There will be a cell phone on the boat, however, and I will call Taffy  
(x57373) Monday morning with the number.

Mark,

The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on 
EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a "muni" and we need to know 
if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them 
from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon 
as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax 
departments.

Please contact me with any questions.

Thanks for your help!

Frank

Regarding to Mike's e:mail dated of Nov 25, I would like to set up a meeting, 
as follows:

 From 9:00 am till 10:00 am

Please advise me if you will be available and your location. Thanks in 
advance.

I suggest you insert "with respect to the Transactions" after the word 
"Counterparty" in the second line of paragraph 1.  Otherwise they look great 
to me.

Attached are:

1. the revised Termination Agreement with BMO; and
2. the draft Termination Agreement with Banque Paribas.

With respect to the BMO Termination Agreement once the deal is finalized, I 
only require:

1. the Agreement date;
2. the Effective Date;
3.  the payment amount; and
4. the payment date.

With respect to the Paribas Termination Agreement, I will need the same 
information, as well as to confirm the date of the ISDA Master and deal 
identification numbers/legs and to obtain copies of the Confirmation 
Letters.  I will try to track down this ancillary information today, but I 
realize it is U.S. Thanksgiving.  Otherwise, I will follow-up Monday morning.

From a financial trading perspective, the Credit Group is reviewing each 
potential counterparty and will not approve any counterparty that is not an 
"Eligible Swap Participant" (as defined in federal regulations as over a 
certain size) from trading derivatives.  Generally speaking, they don't 
approve customers that are smaller than that for any trading from a credit 
perspective but that is up to them.

Does EOL have a screening process for special handling of "potential retail" 
counterparty password applications so that we prevent violations to the EES 
Limited Liability Company agreement? 

Thanks for taking care of this.  Sorry I was not reachable.

David, As long as the long descriptions have not changed and the traders are 
fine with the short description changes as being clearer, I have no problems 
with the changes on the financial side.  Stacy will respond on the physical 
gas side.

David Forster
11/24/99 11:44 AM
Please find attached a spreadsheet showing the new descriptions and some 
samples of the old descriptions (I have to match these by hand, so it is not 
a comprehensive list).

The changes are:

1) Re-ordering of the elements
2) Shortening the index/location description to something which is more 
recognizeable to the traders (and our customers)

We would like to be showing these short descriptions to customers on Monday, 
so your response/input is needed today.

Sorry about the short notice - we're all in the same boat on this one.

Dave

I just finished speaking with Danny Sullivan.  He understands that I have not 
reviewed these transactions; that's fine.  He's not certain when these are 
closing but probably after X-mas.  Please don't feel bound by this 
documentation because it's a "continuation" of the former BTI transaction.  
Even Sarlux/Trakya have some modifications.  Thanks.  SS

Please find attached redrafts of the swap confirm and swap schedule,
with changes marked from the last drafts.

Please note that Enron's obligations to pay principal under the swap
should terminate in the event of a transfer to a third party under section
5.05 of the sale and option agreement before the expiry of the option
period. This is because the third party will not be obliged to swap the
proceeds of sale it receives from PR-C in the event that the option is
exercised. See section 3.3 of the schedule.

Also, the definition of Payments Received may need to be changed once
the flow of funds in the indenture and trust agreement have been
finalized.

Please call me on 214 659 4403 if you have any questions.

David Forster

Bob,

The attached letter format should be used for all of the companies which have 
not transacted online yet and for whom we wish the GTC to supercede an 
existing master agreement. It has been approved by Mark Taylor.

This can be used for all such companies going forward.

Thanks,

Here are my comments.  Do you want to add anything about the reason for 
this?  I don't think it's necessary from a legal point of view but might 
soften the letter a bit.

affected existing Masters, also that confirmations will be always sent.
He said they are very excited about online trading with Enron and want to use 
it ASAP .

Hi Bruce!

Ted took his first steps back to solid foods on Monday night.  He was so sick 
when we left you on Saturday that we had to motor the whole way back to 
Tortola and put him ashore for Saturday night.  We made our flight on Sunday 
and he went to the Dr. on Monday.  They think it was probably food poisoning 
but I don't see why nobody else got it.

Greg's expenses should certainly be part of the common fund.  There were a 
few other common expenses we haven't settled up on yet - Ted had a few 
groceries and a dinner and I paid for the beverage order).  I'll get Ted's 
numbers when I get home tonight and do a tally which I can send tomorrow.  
Let me know if you think of anything else.

When I first get back I usually feel the room swaying when it is small and 
enclosed (like an interior conference room or the shower).  It's a sure sign 
you were acclimatised to the boat!

I'm not sure which e-mail address you are using so I figured I'd send to both.

Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth
     exchange 
     By Corey Grice
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT 

     The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange. The currency? 
Bandwidth. 

     A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today 
opened the
     doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange. The company first announced its 
intention to
     sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May. 

                            Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like 
oil, natural
                            gas and grain. Enron has taken this concept and 
given it a
                            telecommunications spin, offering space on 
high-speed
                            networks to communications carriers.

                            In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or 
service gaps in
                            their networks would have had to enter long-term 
contracts
                            with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth 
needs. The
                            exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman 
for
                            carriers to find short-term contracts or quick 
fixes as they
                            complete network construction or try to manage
                            heavier-than-expected network traffic. 

                            For example, Global Crossing plans to sell 
capacity on a
                            high-speed fiber optic link between New York and 
Los
                            Angeles over the exchange.

     Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market 
next May.

     Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its 
own
     commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New 
York today. 

     RateXchange predicts that the trading of bandwidth and other 
telecommunications products
     could become a $8 billion market by 2002. 

Here are my drafts of letters for ECT and Seagull regarding the transfer of 
Seagull's positions at E.D.&F. Man.   Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Here's my letter.  Any comments?

Mark -- thanks very much for the attached draft agreement.  This is fine and
I'll have it signed by J. Aron and faxed to your attention.

I've researched the documentation that is in place between Aron and Enron.
While we do have a master swap agreement between J. Aron and Enron North
America (or its predecessor) I don't seem to show a master physical
agreement.  Accordingly, I believe the transactions would be subject to
Enron's GT&Cs.  I think we would want to modify these in certain respects
(for example, by making the right to call for collateral mutual).  I'm not
sure if we are going to be issuing paper confirmations in connection with
our online activities, but that would be one place to address it.  Best
regards, Steve

Here is the draft of the amendment letter.  Please let me know if it is
acceptable and I will have it executed.

Sorry we've been out of touch lately.  We were on vacation (sailing in the 
Virgin Islands) the week of Thanksgiving and were pretty busy getting ready 
for it the week or two before that.  There was a big swim meet in San Antonio 
last weekend that T wanted to see so we drove out for that (yawn).

I didn't even know you were leaving BA!  I knew you had been sort of looking 
around for a while but didn't realize you had made a decision.  What's the 
story?

We're planning to have people over (it's the egg nog time of year) on the 
18th - I'm guessing 8 - 10 pm but we'll let you know the details.

Sorry for the delay on getting back to you - looks good to me.

Dear Dave,

Justin and I have had another look at the website and noticed that the old 
Legal & Privacy statement is the one being shown.  The additional language in 
the mark-up below needs to be added before European counterparties access the 
site to trade.

In respect of Finland, we have been in contact with our Finnish legal 
advisers and hope to have the issue resolved (hopefully favourably) today.

Thanks, Edmund.

Edmund Cooper
16/09/99 15:36
Dave,

I've now been given access to the Online system, and I've also seen the 
website - it's all looking pretty good.  However, I noticed on reading 
through the Legal & Privacy statement that there is some text missing!! I've 
attached a mark-up showing the missing text (red and bold) which needs to be 
in there.

Regards, Edmund.

Your understanding is correct - the trades are binding on the legal entity 
holding the user id and password.  Any trades done which either the 
counterparty or we want to be with a different entity should be assigned 
pursuant to a written assignment agreement.  If the counterparty continues to 
misuse the system, maybe we should deny access to the types of products 
particular entities are not "supposed" to trade.

Debbie R Brackett
12/14/99 07:43 AM
My understanding ( as of last week) was that trades done Online were binding 
to the counterparty holding the ID under which the trade was transacted, and 
that confirms (if needed) would we done in that name. A follow up procedure 
was discussed for written assignment to the "correct" counterparty.  This was 
not the case yesterday, where the deal was changed internally to the 
"correct" counterparty without a written assignment.

Mark, Jeff, please comment on the the legal aspects of doing these moves 
internally without a written assignment. Does a verbal OK from each 
counterparty (assignor and assignee)  suffice?

Thanks,

Debbie

We need to know what the resolution plan is to getting Aquilia straight for 
trading Physical and Financial products.   Today we saw Aquilia Risk trade 
Next Day Physical Gas again and we were asked to move the deal to Aquilia 
Energy.  What is being done to get Aquilia Risk from continuing to enter 
Physical trades on line?  My concern for this trade was that we brought it to 
Credit's attention this morning and did not get final word to move the deal 
to Aquilia Energy until late in the day (4.45pm) which affects Logistics 
ability to nominate for next day business.  Logistics has been made aware of 
the late nom and will be working with the Pipe to get the nom in.  If there 
are issues with this late nom from the pipeline we will let you know.

I'm not comfortable with the internal process of  counterparty name changing 
of EOL deals and would like to get comfortable with how we are going to set 
this process up.  I think there should be legal review of all deals that we 
change and would suspect that some form of communication would need to be 
conveyed to the counterparty.  

KC

Excellent solution!

   
	
	

I have talked to Aquilla on several occasions (including today) and they 
continue to say they are capable of playing by the rules.  I will talk to 
them again tomorrow and suggest that we shut off their capability to trade 
physical gas online (and vica versa for Aquila Energy Marketing).  They have 
asked us not to do this however I believe it may be time to revisit this.  We 
do have the legal ability to hold them to their click deals however they do 
not have the contracts to manage physical gas. This would obviously make a 
messy situation.  I suggest that you call Jennifer Denny, Torrey Moorer or 
myself as soon as you see one of these transactions in the future as we can 
check into it immediately.  

All transactions that have occured will be assigned by Aquila to Aquila.  
Mark Taylor will draft the agreements and Aquila has agreed to this.

Tanya and Mark,

We're starting to talk to some resorts about doing weather deals and I wanted 
to give you guys a heads up.
We don't have a structure in place and don't have financials yet; we should 
be getting them sometime this week. 
But, we would like to start sending the ISDA documents so that they can get 
comfortable with them.

Mark: Please send the docs to Dick Deutch,  his number is 314.432.4000. 

Details:
North Peak Resort
10920 Schuetz Road
St. Louis, MO  63146

We're thinking about doing a 1,3 or 5 year deal.  We've already mentioned the 
letter of credit to them.  
The deal might be done on the event of temperature hitting below 28-30 
degrees.  
Please call me if you have any questions.

Best Regards,

Lucy

Lucy:

Cemex has previously signed a confidentiality agreement with us based on our 
form of agreement.  Their form is significantly more burdensome for us.  I 
would prefer that we send our form and let them know that it is substantially 
similar to one previously executed in connection with another matter.

Hi Marc!

Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat. night for "Holiday Cheer" which at 
our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my 
wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.  We'd love to see you guys.  
It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go 
to, you could make this one the kick-off.

The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of 
champagne we're going to share at home that night.  I asked T if we should 
plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.  That, of course, will 
change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!" around 12/29 or 30.

How's BMC?  What are you doing for them?  Do you know Clayton Williams?  I 
think he still works there.

Give us a call so we can catch up.  Tell G we said hi & hope to see you 
Saturday!

Looks good to me.

Any chance of getting the confirms to say "Ashland Inc. through its Ashland 
Specialty Chemicals Comapny division"?

   

Per my conversation with Frank, we are opening up the referenced counterparty 
to trade financial under the division name  indicated above.

Here are my drafts of letters for ECT and Seagull regarding the transfer of 
Seagull's positions at E.D.&F. Man.   Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Can you take care of this for me?

and the only issue they have with the attached amendment (I am forwarding you 
the amendments under separate cover) is the changes to the termination on a

(2) Will the Amendment be executed by year-end?
(3) Is it likely that the termination payment amount (for the Premium Payment 
tranche) stay as it is currently drafted?
(4) Do we or the banks have any room to suggest changes?

Some of these are not final.

I would like to consider some counterparty-specific agreement to solve this 
problem.  What do you think of a side agreement among both KN entities and 
Enron which specifies that a user ID and password have been issued to both of 
KN's legal entities jointly and severally and that transactions for certain 
products (e.g. all financial products) entered into under that user ID and 
password will be deemed executed by KN Trading (their financial trading 
entity) and all others will be deemed executed by KN Marketing (their 
physical entity)?  Do you see any problems here?  Issues re: joint & several 
liability under the ETA but not the Transactions?

Let me know if you need further clarification of the problem.

I haven't run this by Louise yet - she may raise system or commercial 
objections.

Mark
	
	

We continue to struggle with the issue of counterparties trading under the 
wrong name.

KN Trading typically does financial trades, KN Marketing typically does 
physical trading.  We issued seperate ID's to accomadate this however they 
have traded physical this am with KN Trading.  I discussed this with KN 
(Shawn Magovern) and he expressed great frustration with the idea of running 
seperate machines or web sessions.  Shawn asked us to consider what options 
might be available downstream.  His comment was that they will just have to 
turn the system off and that brokers understand their business and apply the 
company name appropriately.   I explained to Shawn that he can control the 
access of his traders and avoid issues in the future however it does require 
them to transact under the appropriate ID.  

Can we develop some form of agreement that would allow us to "automatically" 
assign transaction according to some strict guidelines (I know this is like a 
Power of Attorney)?  Can we look at systematic enhancements in the future 
which would allow for contractual arrangements based on the product?

I would like to get back with Shawn if we can suggest any other options.

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I never did come up with a good 
solution last year to the "cat climbing the Christmas tree" problem except 
fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the 
tree they didn't shake off.  This year she seems content to just hide 
underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just 
gotten too big.  I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about 
double-sided tape?  I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff 
so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a 
discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the 
tree).  And of course, the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden 
and metal ornaments - nothing breakable.  

Christmas is coming again, and in reviewing our mail, I came across your
"problem".  Did you come up with any solution?? A friend of ours (non-cat
owner) suggested putting mouse traps under the tree - a couple of paw snaps
and maybe no more??  Sounded cruel to me, especially for my oldest cat (13
years).
     We have used pepper in some cases in the garden, but in the house, this
would probably be more damaging to the humans than our 4 footed friends :-)
     If you have had any luck last year, please let us know, and we can post
it on our web page which we are revising.  Others would find it interesting
and perhaps amusing as well.
     Looking forward to seeing you again this Christmas,
               Peter from Ticonderoga Farms

Here is an example of what such a letter might look like which may satisfy 
several of the concerns you raised in our call this afternoon.

Paul:

It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be 
covered by an ISDA with some creative confirm work on our part.  It's 
certainly not necessary for us to wait for ISDA to get its act together (it 
may be quite a wait) - we can come up wit our own definitions.  The financial 
power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the 
question fully reviewed.  I guess this is another matter to keep in mind as 
the power pool is restructured:  to the extent we have any influence over the 
resulting structure, it would be nice if it fit easily into a standard 
financial trading structure.

Just random thoughts.

Mark

Paul Simons
11/03/98 12:52 PM
Paul 

Let's get the ISDA in place and then bring in deal types (b) and (c) if and 
when possible.

ISDA have been on the verge of amending the Commodity Definitions since I 
arrived at Enron!

I'll leave it to Shari to respond to your points of detail. Thanks.

Paul

Paul Waine
03/11/98 17:34
Shari, a new question arises re this master. ECTRIC trades following 
commodity derivatives with MS: (a) oil swaps (priced in USD), (b) UK 
electricity - "EFA" elec. forward agreement (priced in GBP) and (c) Nordic 
power (priced in norwegian kroner). Are all these commodities covered by the 
master - at present the latter 2 are probably not covered by an ISDA 
commodity definition, although I understand A&O plan to work on these 
definitions with interested parties in UK/Europe. How does the ISDA deal with 
FX differences - I guess there is a standard approach - GBP and NOK converted 
to USD at spot rate for collateral purposes.

Regards

Paul

Shari Stack
28/10/98 19:11
I was forwarded a copy of your email to Marie Heard and Paul Simons dated 
10/19/98. In response to your queries: 

1. Date of the Agreement: Notes in our file state that "Francesca" in London 
advised that the earliest outstanding trade between the 2 counterparts is 
Nov. 4 '93. From a legal perspective, it does no harm to leave the date as is 
since all it means is that the Agreement is effective as of that day.    

2. "Transferable Letter of Credit": ECT's standard is to have "transferable" 
L/C's in order to be consistent with the "transfer" language included in our 
Master Agreements. The rationale is that if ECT wanted to transfer its 
rights/obligations under the Agreement to an Affiliate, we would want the L/C 
to be transferable as well. Put another way - having a non-transferable L/C 
would be at cross purposes with having a transferable Agreement. 

Also, we in Houston were not aware that ECTRIC does not normally use 
"transferable" L/C's. Perhaps this should be made clear to whomever does 
ECTRIC's documentation in the future.

In any case, can you pls let me know whether you are happy for "transferable" 
to remain in or whether I should go back to MS and ask for it to be 
deleted.    

3. Name of Guaranteed Party: Agree to change; Marie will have a new first 
page of the Guarantee prepared and forwarded to you. 

4. Guarantee from MS: The normal procedure is for them to send us their 
signed Guarantee when they return our execution copies. The form, though, has 
already been agreed and Marie will send you a copy for your information. 

5. Collateral: I have discussed this with Paul Simons. As I understand it,  
you have concerns whether in the event of the insolvency of MS, ECTRIC could 
redeem cash or US T-Bills in order to fulfil MS's obligations to ECTRIC. Mark 
Taylor feels that ECTRIC would have an enforceable security interest in cash 
even though it may be held in London. Regarding the T-Bills, Paul  mentioned 
that there is to be a meeting on this and other matters in the next few 
weeks. 

In order for us to go ahead and finalise the Agreement, I would be happy to 
go back to MS and ask that US T-Bills be deleted as a form of Eligible 
Collateral.      

Pls let me know with regard to points 2 & 5 as soon as possible. 

Kind regards, 

Shari Stack        

Let me check with Mr. B.  I don't think we have any specific plans - probably 
last minute shopping/wrapping.  We're both leaving on Thurs. and returning on 
Sun.

Mark,

could you please have a final glance at  Short and Long Descriptions for the 
5th of January EnronOnline launch.
In the file attached are the examples of the following product descriptions:

-  Emissions
-  Weather
-  US Liquids  Financial

If we do not hear from you by the end of the day Wednesday, Dec 22nd, we'll 
assume that the descriptions are fine as they are, and no changes are needed.

Thank you,
Elena
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

How do you want to handle these?
	
	

Pursuant to Louise's request we need documentation for the following "killed" 
transactions.  In all three cases, Traders have allowed the counterparty out 
of the transaction via verbal agreement with counterparty. 

Trader: Patrice Mims-Thurston 

Trader: Geof Storrey

Until we have determined a legal structure that works for this trading (e.g. 
Chinese walls, public vs. private reference credits, etc.) I would encourage 
caution in how far you go with specific names.  Once they are tainted, it may 
not be possible to cleanse the situation sufficiently to trade on them for 
some time.

When would you like to go to New York to meet with Sullivan & Cromwell?  Let 
me know and I will set something up.

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently 
distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review 
prior to going live.  The intent is to capture as much of the corporate 
credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal 
resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new 
mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have 
for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.  

This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading 
initiatives.  We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop 
as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on 
ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and 
customer base.

This looks fine to me.  Is this the way our confirmations read for telephone 
trades?  If not, do we need to make this change there also?

Mark

Dale Neuner on 12/23/99 10:37:58 AM
Please aprove the folowing and I will make the required changes.

Dale

David Forster
12/23/99 10:06 AM
Dale,

I have discussed the wording with Rudy and agree that we could change the 
wording in the Index long description for Gasoline, #2 and WTI as follows:

Old:

The Index for a month shall be the arithmetic average of the daily  
settlement 
prices for the prompt month NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, Sweet, Crude 
Oil 
futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such month.

New:

The Index for a Determination Period shall be the arithmetic average of the 
daily  
settlement prices for the promptmonth NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, 
Sweet, 
Crude Oil futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such Determination 
Period.

Please run these changes past legal before proceeding. When your changes are 
complete, please run the final version past Rudy as well. Please note that 
all 
Products which reference these Indexes will need the secret squirrel 
treatment for 
updating.

Niamh/Duncan: Please advise if you are happy for the above change to be 
applied 
to your products as well.

Thanks,

Dave

Looks good to me - It should probably get one last look by Mike Corbally, too.

Dale Neuner on 12/27/99 10:33:58 AM
Attached please find a Weather Long Description, modified pursuant to our 
conversation this morning.
I will change the CDD Product Typre description as well. Also, last week we 
changed the reference to the price quote to remove reference to "per unit of 
volume".

Please review and offer approval/comments.

David:

For your ease of reference, bolding represents additional language; italics 
represents changes.

Should I be changing the Norway and UK components as well, or will that be 
done by PCG London? 
(I am more than happy to do it.)

Dale

That's fine with me - I don't anticipate any problems at this point.  Don't 
worry about losing days, though.  We can always make under the table 
adjustments next month if necessary.

Carol St Clair

Mark:
I apparently have 1 1/2 days left.  How would you feel about me taking 
Thursday P.M. and next Tuesday off, assuming that I get these year-end deals 
closed?  Feel free to say no to Thursday if you are not comfortable having 
only 1 attorney here.
Carol

	
	

We have not restricted access at this point given the request came from 
Aquila contracts and credit.  Aquila can restrict themselves via the 
administration function should the elect to.  This will mean that Aquila's 
contract and credit people will need to talk to their commercial people. 
Debbie Brackett requested collateral on all financial trades done by Aquila 
Energy Marketing.  This prompted Aquilla's credit to say they would stop 
trading as such.  Aquilla's traders feel we should provide an alternative 
solution.    The contractual solution we have proposed will resolve the 
contractual issues however it does not fix the intraday credit issue.  EOL 
will not apply the trades to the correct headroom number when doing the 
credit look prior to the completion of a transaction.

We need to evaluate if there is a systematic solution which can afford to 
give the customer what they want and cover all the credit bases.  The 
solution would have  the system compare the ID and the product and then 
allocates the trade to the appropriate company for both contractual and 
headroom purposes.

For now we will continue to assign trades between companies and credit will 
continue to request collateral as appropriate.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

David Forster
12/29/99 03:24 AM
Bob,

Is this the latest on Aquila?

Is this still an issue for KN?

I note that the Aquila contacts requesting a profile change are Contracts and 
Credit - have we spoken to the traders? I'm not comfortable that limiting the 
profiles provides the best solution for the customer - bearing in mind that 
our primary customer is the trader, who will be the one actively using EOL.

I'm also not real happy about restricting a customer's profile - although I 
realise that we have done so for Power (license issue) and we do so for 
credit purposes. More importantly, though, we are talking about restricting a 
customer's profile to make it harder for an actively trading counterparty 
(valid or not) to be doing trades.

To my way of thinking, we need a solution which encourages the traders to 
trade without annoying other elements in Aquila to the point where they pull 
access to EnronOnline - which brings me back to the assignment solution, 
hairy though it may be.

Thoughts?

Dave

12/28/99 04:08 PM
hello all,

After spending much time on the phone with Aquila, it was requested by them 
(Scott Eckermann, Contracts and Terry Batt, Credit) that we take active 
measures internally to limit the product profile of both Aquila Risk 
Management and Aquila Energy Marketing to their respective trading 
competencies.  Aquila Risk trades financially under an existing Master 
Agreement and Aquila Energy Marketing trades physically under existing Master 
Physical Agreements.  I informed Aquila that we would make changes to their 
profiles after the market closes today.  If we should not take such action at 
this time, please call me at 713-853-9897.

thanks
brant

	
	

	
	

Aquila and others continue to transact under the wrong company (ie physical 
under the financial company and financial under the physical company).  I 
have had several conversations with them concerning this however, they have 
requested that we provide som sort of legal framework which will allow them 
to transact under one ID for seperate companies.  Mark has discussed this 
with outside counsel and are comfortable with such an arrangement.  
Essentially the document would state that physical transactions done under ID 
XXXXXXX will be with Aquila Energy Marketing and financial transactions done 
under ID XXXXXXXX will be with Aquila Risk Management.  

Please let me know if we can proceed with this type of document.  The only 
other alternatives at this point are to 1.) assign transacations as they are 
completed 2.) remove execute rights according to the company.

 

There are conflicts for the 2:00 time slot and so many year-end deals taking 
up everyone's time and attention that I think it makes sense to reschedule 
for a later date.  

Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
12/22/98 10:15 AM
Mark, would it would it be possible to move the meeting to 2 PM Houston time 
today?  If there are schedule conflicts or if a room is not available then 
perhaps we can reschedule it for after the Holidays.

Mark H. has asked me to prepare an outline of an "acceptable" regulatory 
framework for OTC energy derivatives that we could use as a fallback position 
next year.  Here is a draft I've come up with.  Any suggestions?

Friday at 10 looks good to us.

RAISLERK@sullcrom.com on 12/29/99 12:04:16 PM
David  has an appointment first thing in the morning.  Can we meet at 10  or

Mark,

You might want to check with Paul on this.  How have we arranged our IPE 
trading?  Since we are talking about exchange-traded contracts here, not 
dealing with customers, it may be possible to use an entity other than EEFT.  

Hope all is well.

Bob,

Apologies for not having got back to you sooner but I have only today 
returned from two weeks holiday to find your e-mail awaiting me!

Anyway, I have already put in a call to Derek Oliver (whom I know quite well, 
having negotiated the legal documentation for our first Pulpex application) 
to be told that he is out of the office but that he will return my call.

My initial thoughts, however, - and the main reason why I need to speak to 
Derek - is that, as you know, all financially-settled derivatives are (for 
regulatory reasons) arranged in London by Enron Europe Finance & Trading 
Limited (EEFT) (rather than Enron Europe), which arranges deals for ECTRIC.  
I am unsure without speaking to Derek whether the Exchange will allow for 
EEFT to be a member of the Exchange as an agent (rather than as a principal) 
for ECTRIC.  EEFT never enters into deals itself as principal, and ECTRIC can 
only entre into deals via EEFT.  

Anyway, let me have a word with Derek and see what we can come up with.

I shall be in touch as soon as I have spoken to Derek.

Kind regards and happy New Year,

Mark

Mark,

Steve Kim has been working with me in Houston where one of his roles is 
PULPEX trading on a day-to-day basis.  He will be moving to London in late 
January to assist in our European marketing efforts.  I would like him to be 
able to trade PULPEX from London when he is not on customer calls.  My intent 
 Enron Europe would be a member of the exchange
 There would be a give-up agreement between ECTRIC and ENA where trades 
executed by Europe would automatically be transferred into ENA's 
  accounts

The exchange thinks this should be easy to set up from a legal perspective 
and Derick Oliver at 171 815 8502 to initiate the necessary docs.  Please let 
me know what you think.

Regards,

Bob Crane 

Louise - If you are back in Houston I'd like to get together and discuss the 
credit derivatives project.  Otherwise, maybe we can chat by phone?

Mark

I see what you mean.  Another thing we need to consider is whether or not 
this is part of our market maker status for the exchange - do you know if  
Bob wants Steve's activities in London to be part of that?

Mark Elliott
01/04/2000 11:41 AM
Mark

Thanks for your message.  Apparently, EEFT is the Member of IPE as a 
principal - but always acts through brokers when placing orders for ECTRIC 
(i.e., never places orders itself on the Exchange).  I'm not sure that Bob 
would want to have Steve place orders through brokers for ECTRIC rather than 
being able to trade on the Exchange himself.  I'll know more once I chat to 
the Exchange about the potential ways forward.

Kind regards

Mark

I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her 
conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is 
the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the 
online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue 
the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are 
not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't 
know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs 
a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem 
getting one for them.

Nony Flores
01/05/2000 02:50 PM
	

Mark:  I'm not sure if Janice had the opportunity to talk to you about the 
point of attaching GTC's to on-line confirms or not; however, since she is on 
vacation this week and we started trading liquids on-line today, Alan 
suggested that I contact you and find out the outcome of this ongoing 
question.  Do we attach GTCs to each confirm that's sent out to the EOL 
counterparty?

Thanks.
Nony
Alan Aronowitz
11/17/99 10:06 AM
I have not had any discussions with Mark Taylor on the point of attaching 
GTCs. I don't know why it has been determined to be appropriate to do the 
attachment. Please consult with Mark on this and let me know what you find 
out. Thanks.

Alan

   
	
	

You will recall that we went to a meeting last month w/ the EOL people while 
you were out of town.  That meeting revealed that a lot of work still needed 
to be done on the confirms.  Of course, there still hasn't been time to 
finish the liquids products EOL confirm templates, and I think the priority 
got less urgent, since these products will be among the last to be traded by 
EOL.  But the quesiton lingers about the need to attach GTCs to each confirm 
that's sent out to the EOL counterparty.  It seemed to us that perhaps you 
and Mark Taylor and others might have had discussions on that topic ahnd 
reached some conclusion.  Rob Cass made a rather cogent appeal that we not 
require the attachment (lots of manhours, for one reason, since the computer 
will not automatically generate the GTCs or autofax them).  But we never had 
a chance to talk about this, so I'm wondering if you could give me your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

By the way, it looks like the SK deal closing is on for next week, so I'll be 
leaving for Singapore on Monday.
Lynn E Shivers
11/09/99 06:33 PM
Have you had a chance to review and finalize the templates for any of our EOL 
confirmations?    

Also, have any decisions been made on "GTC" attachment/no attachment?

Thanks for your help!

Lynn

I agree completely, have talked to the Mayors Office - Citizens' Assistance 
Office, the Traffic & Transportation Dept. (who gave me Ms. Dorsey's name) 
and have written to Ms. Dorsey.  I suggest you also complain to our City 
Council member and the other at-large members.  Since Dorsey is the Bikeway 
Coordinator, she won't have much incentive to do away with a designated 
bikeway but Council members want our votes:

GABRIEL VASQUEZ gvasquez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us - I think he represents the 
Heights
ANNISE D. PARKER aparker@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us - I think Gordon has already 
written to her
GORDON QUAN gquan@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us
ORLANDO SANCHEZ osanchez@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us
CHRIS BELL cbell@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us
CARROLL G. ROBINSON crobinso@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us

The last 5 are "at-large" members of the council.  I got all of these from 
the City web site so I can't be sure it's a current list.

Another argument for two lanes on Heights is that with only one lane, some 
percentage of traffic will divert itself to side streets making them less 
safe for residents there.

And p.s. the argument that this lane is designed for use by bicycle commuters 
is particularly empty since the lane doesn't go anywhere - there's no 
connecting route at either end that I am aware of - do they expect all these 
hypothetical bicycle commuters to get on I 10?

Here is a draft letter to the Exchange requesting permission to effect the

don't know if G has already email you... Heights Blvd is now only one lane.
if you have time, please email your complaints to the people referenced in
G's long & attached email.

I just got Ms. Dorsey's email address, it's
mdorsey@pwe.ci.houston.tx.us.

   -----Original Message-----
   If any of you care to voice your opinion about Height Blvd. the best
   person to speak to is:
   Mignette Dorsey, City of Houston Bikeway Coordinator

   713-837-0003

   I spoke to her and found out that this has been planned since the
   early 90's (see how fast our government works).  She said that she
   has received several complaints but the project will continue until
   completion (they have to put down the bike symbols) before it would
   be reconsidered.  If you don't like the restriped Heights Blvd. I
   suggest you call Ms. Dorsey and email the following:

   Jeff King - Public Works

   wjohnson@pwe.ci.houston.tx.us

   Robert Litke - Planning & Development Dept
   rlitke@pd.ci.houston.tx.us

   Annise Parker - City Councilwoman

Mark:

Happy new year. I hope your new year was eventful on the personal side and
uneventful on the business side.

As you will have seen from my e-mail earlier this week, we are very close to
final on the Supplement. We just have a couple of firms to hear from and we
are chasing them down. One of those is Enron, which you recall took on the
responsibility for the various commodities that no one else volunteered for
(benzene & methanol). Can you check up on the status of the review?

Thanks.

Bob

We are scheduled at Ken Raisler's office at 9:00 on Thursday.  The address is 
125 Broad Street (on the eastern end of Broad St. - right by the East 
River).  See you there!

Thursday works well for Bryan and me, so please book Ken's slot!

We'll travel out on Wednesday night.

I have now heard back from Ken Raisler's office that the only time he has 
left next week is Thursday morning.  Does that work for you guys?  

Any thoughts on this Platt's issue?
Robert Pickel <RPICKEL@isda.org> on 01/05/2000 02:41:37 PM
Responses to our request for a final review of the 1999 Supplement have been
very good. We are still waiting on a couple of responses. I won't name
names. You know who you are.

Please also review the attached e-mail from Patricia Hogan at Goldman Sachs
regarding the appropriate Platt's references. She suggests that the Platt's
reference in each definition should be to the version of Platt's that is
published in the relevant region. Please let me know as soon as possible
whether you agree with her suggestion. If you agree with her suggestion,
which I believe is largely mechanical, I would ask that those who took
responsiblity for a particular commodity let us know the proper Platt's
reference for the commodity and delivery point. Otherwise, we will assume
that Tricia's suggestions should be followed.

I look forward to wrapping up this project in the next ten days, so please
respond promptly.

Bob Pickel

 We have reviewed the Reference Price Sources for the commodities
that have been assigned to us.  I will forward our changes, amendments and
updates under separate cover.

 In the course of reviewing the Price Sources, we came across one
issue that was not discussed on the recent conference call, but is one about
which we have strong feelings.  We believe that the Price Source used for a
particular commodity should reflect the geographic source of the commodity,
e.g., Platt's Asia-Pacific for Asian commodities, Platt's European,
Marketscan or Platt's Crude Marketwire for European commodities and Platt's
Oilgram for North American commodities.  While reviewing the Reference Price
Sources for Fuel Oil, we found that in many cases only Platt's Oilgram is
listed, even though the product is European or Asian.  We would prefer to
delete the references to Platt's Oilgram for products outside of North
America.  However, we understand that such a step cannot be taken without a
discussion with the wider group (which may not be feasible at this point).
If such a discussion is not feasible, we would like (if possible) to include
the European or Asian-Pacific price source in the Supplement along with the
U.S. price source for all products (including those commodities we have not
reviewed and commented on).

 I apologize for bringing this issue up so late in the process.
Please call me, Keir Prince (011 44 171 774 5004) or Aaron Marcus (357-9514)
if you would like to discuss.

I called and asked for an information packet on the Enron insurance plan (it 
is through MetLife) last week.  I will let you know as soon as it comes.

Thanks for the update on Tim & Sharon.  I guess the down-side of a 2 year old 
is that she may already have a fairly well formed personality, but the 
up-side is they will know she is healthy and she is still young enough to 
learn a new language easily.

Feel free to let me know when the bank statement comes - I seem to remember 
that we came up with a scheme to deal with that last year.  I'll bet we can 
do it again!  And until then we can just bask in the light of this amazing 
run in the ENE stock price - wow!

          Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85

          A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | 
ENTERTAINMENT 

          Filed at 3:21 p.m. EST

          By The Associated Press

          LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th
          century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of 
legions of
          readers, has died. He was 85. 

          O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book
          for several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not 
given
          and there were conflicting reports of the date. 

          The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but 
newspapers
          and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday. O'Brian
          had lived in France since 1949. 

          O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy
          during the Napoleonic wars. 

          A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him 
to
          evoke a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic 
jets and
          smart bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of
          sea battles fought under sail. 

          The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the 
story
          of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack
          Aubrey, and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and 
secret
          agent who doesn't much like sailing. 

          Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic
          readership from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they 
achieved
          wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical 
fiction''
          genre in which they generally were reviewed. 

          In 1991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ``the best novelist 
you
          have never heard of.'' 

          ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which 
happens
          to be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, 
praising
          ``the intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the 
plotting,
          and the brilliance of the writing.'' 

          O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, 
specialist
          language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't
          remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the 
frantic activity
          on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement 
as a
          man-of-war turns to engage the enemy. 

          A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, 
but
          O'Brian didn't think definitions important. 

          ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he 
once said.
          ``Explanation almost certainly would be.'' 

          O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John 
Bayley, a
          former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's
          ``originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of 
(history) to
          invent a new style of fiction.'' 

          ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has 
described the
          whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet 
lyrical
          accuracy.'' 

          O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted 
questions
          about his personal life. 

          He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, 
and
          it wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an 
English
          doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily
          Telegraph said in an obituary Friday. 

          The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but
          changed his name in 1945. During his school years, he was 
frequently ill,
          spending much time reading. His writing career began at age 15, 
when he
          published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow 
leopard. 

          During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly
          with Britain's Political Intelligence Department. 

          In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern
          France. His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956,
          about a Pacific expedition. 

          O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in 
Britain
          by the beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the
          American publisher W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight 
home. 

          The rest, as they say, is publishing history. 

          Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 
20th
          book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily
          Telegraph reported. 

          O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph
          Banks. A linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone 
de
          Beauvoir and Colette. 

          O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.

          Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard,
          from his first marriage. 

Here is a revised version - let me know what you think.

Seagull's positions at E.D.&F. Man.   Please let me know if you have any

This will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there 
was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment (through a private 
placement) in an internet/communications company.  My response was that Enron 
prohibits the trading by employees of (i) any security on the Restricted List 
maintained by the Compliance Group, (ii) any security, instrument or 
commodity within that employees area of responsibility and (iii) any energy 
commodity.  I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my 
understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List.

While I did not mention it on the phone, I should point out that it would be 
unwise to take a position in a competitor of Enron's that would (or might in 
the future) give you control or the appearance of control or influence over 
the management of that competitor.

Adele,

Here is a revised version.  Let me know what you think.

Mark

Mark,
 Please go ahead and have this Letter Agreement executed as revised and send
it to my attention.  I have instructed the traders concerned to execute the
password agreement. Thank you.

Would you be okay if our group organized a lunch for Bill and the credit 
group to celebrate his promotion?  It could alos serve the purpose perhaps of 
catching up with them on the latest issues.  Let me know what you think.  In 
lieu of going out, I was thinking that Suzanne could arrange to have it 
catered by someone that serves good food.

This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North 
American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those 
portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying 
those provisions which are subject to the masters.  In my view there are 
really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.  Most of 
the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent 
there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured 
interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.  In one case I 
had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by 
paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow 
the master to control.  The only sections we had to amend were the first 
sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in 
the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of 
section 6(e).  And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has 
insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or 
another.

Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to 
the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and 
use of the website.  In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual 
trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, 
perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like "Except as set forth under 
paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA 
and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe 
master agreement shall prevail.

If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would 
be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to "The agreements listed beloweach
comprises a" or better yet "Each agreement listed below is a" rather than 
"The agreements listed below comprise the".

Dave,

I'm trying to reach agreement with PowerGen re: EOL trades - they are still 
very concerned with the overriding effect of the ETA, and will not accept our 
position.

However, I have managed to get somewhere..........and I attach a draft I 
propose to send to their lawyer.  This is I believe as far as we can get with 
PowerGen (I did speak to him and I don't think he will go any further than as 
set forth in the draft).  The key point for me was to get PowerGen to agree 
(which I think they will) that the short + long descriptions [key elements of 
any trade] prevail over the master.

Thoughts, comments please....

My view - if PowerGen agrees the draft, that should give us sufficient 
comfort...

Thanks

Justin

We need to revise the Counterparty Matrix procedures.  Counterparties with a 
North American financial master agreement should only map to North American 
financial products (including all weather and paper transactions).  
Therefore, please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those 
counterparties with a North American master map to GTC's for European 
derivative transactions.  Please call me or Tana if you have any questions.

Thanks!

I'm off to New York for a meeting but thought you might like to see this:

Wednesday January 12, 11:30 am Eastern Time

RESEARCH ALERT - Enron price target raised

NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised Enron
Corp's (NYSE:ENE - news) price target to $75 from $60 and cut 2000 earnings 
per share
estimates.

-- raised price target because ``as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over 
the next 12 months, we anticipate that an
additional $15 of value will be created for shareholders, with considerably 
greater value possible as the market develops.'' 

    -- cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 "due to
fine-tuning."
    -- introduced 2001 EPS of $1.75.
    -- "Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in

2000. Enron has built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity 
industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in
2000."

-- ``Bandwidth trading keys off Enron's market dominant skills developed in 
trading electricity and natural gas. After executing
the first key bandwidth trade in 1999, Enron appears poised to begin posting 
rising transaction volumes, establishing the
credibility of this new industry.''

-- ``The ultimate value of bandwidth trading is likely to exceed the total 
value of Enron's existing electricity and gas franchise.''

Mike Robison and I have finalized the form of GTC's for ECFC and are 
forwarding them to you for further distribution.  Thanks.

 

John - 

The only modifications to ECFC's online GTC's are as follows:

Contract Formation In order to maintain consistency with the other product 
lines online GTCs, we've modified this section to reflect the same 
introduction as reflected in ELFI, EGLI, ERAC and EPC.

Damages and Limitation We've added a 2 line bilateral provision regarding 
payment.

Financial Information We've added the two paragraphs re credit provisions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Law and Jurisdiction We replaced this section in its entirety with the new 
policy in effect as of June 1998.

Appendix II We've added the Marine Provisions Addendum.

Appendix III We've added the Transportation Addendum.

Thanks.

Although these products were not on the release list for the Jan 5 release, 
we have been actively pursuing their completion and posting to EOL. Since our 
reviews of the products are complete, the Petrochems guys are extremely eager 
to have their products posted. Please offer your approval of the attached 
ASAP so I can get this and the product onto EOL.

Nony -

We were expecting delivery of the Methanol GTC today. Please be aware that 
the uploading of GTC's can sometimes be laborious, and since the Petrochem 
guys are eager to get this out, time is of the essence. Please let me know 
when you can expect delivery of the Methanol GTC to Mark Taylor.

They wish to amend the PA such that:

Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause 
them to breach any third party rights 
they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their 
learning of the same.
they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time

ETA

They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron 
(see 1(iii))
They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see 
last sentence of 2(b))
They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since 
they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal
To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be 
able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e))
They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party 
is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful 
default/negligence/omission.
They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that 
electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the 
system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)).

Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points.  
Please let me know what you think - thanks

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT, 
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL 
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries 
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via 
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway, 
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the 
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the 
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or 
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed 
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs 
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in 
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of 
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely 
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more 
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summary 
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant 
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction 
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on 
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to 
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news 
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below 
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on 
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely 
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a 
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk 
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be 
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and 
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks 
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our 
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the 
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional 
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to 
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in 
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general 
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under 
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their 
constitutional documents if they wish to trade).  

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading 
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly 
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure 
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business 
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur 
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include 
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or 
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US 
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include 
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the 
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that 
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which 
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality 
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron 
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or 
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will 
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without 
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that 
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute 
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the 
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve 
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in 
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear 
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in 
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be 
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and 
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a 
"substantial professional effort" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being 
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our 
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade 
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should 
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this 
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic 
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading 
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory 
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being 
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty 
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence 
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However, 
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing 
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law) 

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an 
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under 
the US Commodities Exchange Act. 

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product 
constitutes a "security" under US securities laws (please see attached 
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of 
securities to "accredited investors" which will allow us to deal with 
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our 
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should 
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider 
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security 
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.

Best regards

Paul

Just so you know what may be coming, I have spent roughly half of my time in 
the office over the last six weeks negotiating these sorts of requests.  It 
is very time consuming.  My comments below in red.

Best of luck and feel free to call with any issues.

PA

They wish to amend the PA such that:

Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause 
them to breach any third party rights Does this mean that Enron's use does 
not violate third party rights or Eastern's?  This doesn't really make sense 
to me:  if it is Enron's use then that's our problem and I don't see 
Eastern's concern and if it is Eastern's use that should be their problem, 
not ours - how will we know what arrangements they have in place with third 
parties?  No one else has raised this issue - is this something that is 
particularly of concern in the UK?
they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their 
learning of the same. When they notify us is not an issue - as long as they 
understand that they will be liable for anything that happens with their 
passwords - whether authorized or not.
they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time  
What is there in the PA that would prevent them from telling us about changed 
information?

ETA

They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron 
(see 1(iii))  This language refers to a variety of language on the site - 
including things like the submission screen, the Mater User's abilities to 
restrict sub-user id's, the long descriptions, etc.  It is simply not 
possible to create a list of every single item on the website that controls 
how the site is used and contracts are created.  This is one they will just 
have to live with.  They have to give their traders the credit to read what 
they are doing and if they don't like it they can stop trading.   
They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see 
last sentence of 2(b))  I think 2(b) already limits our use of the 
information to "Enron" which is defined pretty much as Enron and its 
affiliates.  Are they asking for more than that?  You can point them to 
section 5 which severely limits what we can do with confidential information. 
They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since 
they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal 
EOL is not set up to allow one entity to trade on behalf of another.  How 
would we ever know who our counterparty really was?  If they want to trade 
for several counterparties, they need to fill out a separate PA (and 
separately click on the ETA) for each legal entity.  They should subsequently 
restrict the sub-user id's for each of those entities to trade only the 
products appropriate to that entity.
To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be 
able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e))  We have agreed that we will 
continue to furnish confirmations where we have a master agreement in place 
that calls for us to send confirms.  I've had a number of counterparties ask 
for this and have explained that even when there is not a master in place, in 
most cases we intend to continue to send confirms.  In fact, it is our 
intention (and the instructions you and I have received from Louise in no 
uncertain terms) that the trading should look as close as possible to its 
current form.  That includes contractual terms and the sending of confirms.  
Having said all that, the commercial people look forward with fondness to a 
time when confirms will become electronic and therefore this language was put 
in the ETA.  I would be surprised if, should we ever reach such a time, we 
would refuse to send confirms to those counterparties stuck in the dark ages 
of "blue ink on dead trees."  Given the frequency with which this on comes 
up, I wonder if future versions of the ETA should omit the offending 
language.
They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party 
is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful 
default/negligence/omission.  This strikes me as a non-starter.  The best we 
can do is to exclude damage we suffer by reason of our own gross negligence, 
fraud or willful misconduct.  If they want to be without risk, they can 
continue to use the phone.
They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that 
electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the 
system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)).  They can stop trading at 
any time and do not need to terminate the agreement.  We have agreed on rare 
occasions that we will deactivate their password if we receive written notice 
from them requesting deactivation.  I have suggested that they might feel 
more comfortable giving the Mater User ID and password to someone in their 
control group so that they don't have to worry about the trader leaving and 
taking the important password along.  The Master User can always turn off a 
sub-user immediately.  I'm uncomfortable with the delivery issue since I 
usually don't get "notice from the system of delivery" when I send an 
e-mail.  Even if return receipts were always used, I don't know that they 
always work and I wouldn't want the counterparty to be able to prevent our 
giving notice simply by refusing to open our e-mails.  Certainly no one would 
successfully assert that an e-mail notice was effective unless properly 
addressed.  On the other hand, to be practical, if the issue is critical, we 
will not be relying on an e-mail notification in any event and I can 
understand their concern that someone might be on holiday when the e-mail is 
received - not as big an issue with a fax or letter that can be easily opened 
by someone else.

Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points.  
Please let me know what you think - thanks

In some cases you just have to wait these guys out.  I know the traders are 
anxious to get people online and trading, but remember that the same is true 
on the other side.  Luckily for us, Louise is willing to back us up on this 
and tell our counterparties to just sit back and watch the rest of the world 
get the good prices if they don't like our agreements.  In several cases, 
counterparties who have called with difficult legal departments like this 
ultimately just went ahead and clicked on the thing to start trading.

Mark - 

Mike Robison and I have finalized the form of GTC's for ECFC and are 
forwarding them to you for further distribution.  Thanks.

 

John - 

The only modifications to ECFC's online GTC's are as follows:

Contract Formation In order to maintain consistency with the other product 
lines online GTCs, we've modified this section to reflect the same 
introduction as reflected in ELFI, EGLI, ERAC and EPC.

Damages and Limitation We've added a 2 line bilateral provision regarding 
payment.

Financial Information We've added the two paragraphs re credit provisions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Law and Jurisdiction We replaced this section in its entirety with the new 
policy in effect as of June 1998.

Appendix II We've added the Marine Provisions Addendum.

Appendix III We've added the Transportation Addendum.

Thanks.

Mark -

Although these products were not on the release list for the Jan 5 release, 
we have been actively pursuing their completion and posting to EOL. Since our 
reviews of the products are complete, the Petrochems guys are extremely eager 
to have their products posted. Please offer your approval of the attached 
ASAP so I can get this and the product onto EOL.

Nony -

We were expecting delivery of the Methanol GTC today. Please be aware that 
the uploading of GTC's can sometimes be laborious, and since the Petrochem 
guys are eager to get this out, time is of the essence. Please let me know 
when you can expect delivery of the Methanol GTC to Mark Taylor.

long descriptions for benzene, mixed xylene, toluene and methanol.   We have 
also finalized the form of GTC's for EPC (who trades benzene, xylene and 
toluene) and are forwarding them to you for further distribution.

 

Note:  GTC's for Enron Clean Fuels Company (who trades methanol) will follow

I have gone ahead and forwarded this and the ECFC version to the EOL people 
to be uploaded.

I do have a concern though that I wanted to ask you about. These GTC's use 
the defined term "Commercial Term" which is defined as follows:

"Commercial Terms" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing 
the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law 
that is issued in connection with a Transaction.

We have taken the position in our other EOL trading that the transaction is 
complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over 
the system by reference to the GTC, the numbers submitted by the counterparty 
(usually volume and price) and the Long Description.  We've gone to some 
lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long 
Description contain all of the necessary terms.  It's not clear to me that we 
intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of 
Commercial Terms.  Are these transactions not intended to be binding until 
the confirmation is signed?  Any thoughts on this?

Hey Mark - I thought you had my new (as of July 1997) address - sorry about 
that.  I'm now at:

1322 Rutland
Houston, TX 77008

(713)863-7190 - home
(713)853-7459 - work

I heard about Mrs. Boone in the Scots News.  I thought it was a nice 
write-up.  The Boones were very special people and I regret extremely that I 
didn't get to know them better.

Hope you guys are doing well.  I was in NYC in Nov. but was so busy I didn't 
have time for visits or fun of any kind!  Hope to get back soon but there's 
nothing for NY on the calendar.  Probably DC early Jan., London late Jan. and 
Buenos Aires and Sao Paolo in Feb.  I saw the magazine article (with such 
good photos!) a couple of months back.  My mom actually called to tell me 
about it.

Did you guys get my Christmas card?  I thought Celena might get a kick out of 
it.  Tell Debbie & Celena I said "Hi!" 

Take care,  Mark T.

I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & 
Cromwell in NY) can't.  Any way for them to get access so they can advise us 
on this?  They are also the guys who will help with a training session on 
various legal issues and company policies in trading.

Mark,

As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site:   
http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/
It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let 
me know if it doesn't work.  

The User ID is: "user1"  and the Password is:  "test"  .

I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our 
information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements.

In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a 
limited customer listing.

Via Facsimile

MEMORANDUM TO:=09Paul Simons=20
=09(Enron Europe Limited)=20
=09=20
=09Mark Taylor=20
This memorandum summarizes the proposed procedures we discussed during our=
=20
meeting on January 13, 2000 for use in connection with the credit derivativ=
es=20
? This disclosure should inform the Reference Entity of the introduction of=
=20
the Product, and describe the general nature of the Product and the manner =
in=20
which it will be traded (e.g., through Enron Online).

? In general, however, Enron need not request that the Reference Entities=
=20
consent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the Reference=20
Entities, except as set forth below in paragraph 2.=20

  2. Consent =01* Enron should, however, obtain the prior consent of certai=
n=20
types of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference=
=20
Entities.

? In particular, consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit=
h=20
which Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or=
=20
other services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t=
he=20
Reference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha=
t=20
could be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme=
nt.

? Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated=20
counterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron=
=20
trades on an exclusively arms=01, length basis with no advisory or similar=
=20
services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations.

? Where consent is sought, Enron should include a request that the Referenc=
e=20
Entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being=20
included in the list of Reference Entities.  If a Reference Entity fails or=
=20
refuses to execute the letter, Enron will need to make a determination, on =
a=20
case-by-case basis, as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o=
n=20
the list of Reference Entities.  However, it should be recognized that, by=
=20
requesting consent, Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as=
 a=20
Reference Entity in the absence of consent.

3. Chinese Wall =01* We understand that it will not be feasible to construc=
t a=20
complete =01&Chinese Wall=018 between the operations related to the Product=
 and=20
Enron=01,s other trading activities.  This is due primarily to the fact tha=
t=20
activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as=
=20
Enron=01,s other trading activities.  However, Enron should implement a mod=
ified=20
Chinese Wall between the trading operations.  This approach would enhance=
=20
Enron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety=
 or=20
breach of duty by facilitating Enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20
information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20
Product. This could be accomplished through a number of procedures.

? First, Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20
separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc=
t,=20
on the one hand, and Enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand=
. =20
Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as=
=20
other traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the=
=20
floor set off by partitions or similar features.

? Second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio=
n=20
between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t=
o=20
the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20
domain.  In addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe=
ct=20
to the procedures through training programs.

? Finally, senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit=
or=20
communications between the groups of traders and to review and make=20
determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would=
=20
otherwise be prohibited under the procedures.  These procedures will be=20
similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron=01,s equ=
ity=20
trading activities.

4. Restricted List -- Enron should establish and maintain a =01&restricted =
list=018=20
of those entities on which Products may not be traded.

? Initially, the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i=
s=20
not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its=20
relationships with such entities; e.g., those entities with respect to whic=
h=20
Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their=
=20
inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives=20
material, non-public information.  In addition, those entities with which=
=20
Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to =
be=20
excluded, depending on the terms of such agreements.

? Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20
information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed. =20
Pursuant to these procedures, Enron should suspend the listing of quotation=
s,=20
and therefore the issuance of new Products, with respect to a Reference=20
Entity, if Enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20
regarding such Entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension=
=20
necessary or advisable.  This would include situations in which Enron is=20
considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity.  I=
n=20
addition, the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud=
ed=20
or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron=01,s possession of information as=
=20
well; e.g., where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20
respect to such Entities.=20

? The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for=
 a=20
Product held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests=
=20
Enron to do so.  The procedures should also address the pricing of the=20
closing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th=
at=20
minimizes Enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20
effecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20
information.=20

? Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel, which should=
=20
include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi=
th=20
any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the=
=20
restricted list.=20

As noted, we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew, which wi=
ll=20
need to be integrated into Enron=01,s existing policies and procedures.  In=
=20
addition, as we have advised you in our prior memoranda, there are no=20
procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities=20
arising in connection with its offering of the Product.  However, the=20
implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr=
on=20
in mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by=
=20
Reference Entities.
Please call us if you have questions on these or other issues.

I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how 
well it worked for you to recieve them.  I took a roll of film to be

I tried to send this to your juno address and it came back.  Just in case you 
are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes 
ago:
Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.  He will appear 
on "Our World" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m. CST to discuss Enron's year-end 
financial and operating highlights.  
	
	

I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how 
well it worked for you to recieve them.  I took a roll of film to be 
developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as 
well as prints.  I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send 
to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll.

I would like to attend.

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after 
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference 
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were 
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was 
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities 
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each 
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or 
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing 
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of 
My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice 
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved 
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on 
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we 
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those 
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them 
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the 
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference 
Entities as soon as possible.

Bryan Seyfried
01/19/2000 06:35 AM
Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that 
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small 
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies 
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.

We've deleted this definition:

"Commercial Terms" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing 
the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law 
that is issued in connection with a Transaction.

and added the following new definition which mirrors the wording of Section 
1.1 of the online GTC:

  "Special Terms and Conditions" means the special terms and conditions of a 
particular Transaction for the sale or purchase of Products, including but 
not limited to, payment terms, price, quantity/tolerance, Products 
description, specifications, delivery location and delivery window shall be 
as set forth on this website ("Special Terms and Conditions");
We've also made a global change to the entire document replacing "Commercial 
Terms" with "Special Terms and Conditions."

 EPC   ECFC 
Thanks.
Nony Flores

   

Mark:
The defined term "Commercial Term" which is contained in the Apendix I to the 
EPC gtcs should have been modified to reflect the definitional changes made 
in Section 1.1 of the gtcs.  I"ll work with Nony to get it corrected.

I have gone ahead and forwarded this and the ECFC version to the EOL people 
to be uploaded.

I do have a concern though that I wanted to ask you about. These GTC's use 
the defined term "Commercial Term" which is defined as follows:

"Commercial Terms" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing 
the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law 
that is issued in connection with a Transaction.

We have taken the position in our other EOL trading that the transaction is 
complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over 
the system by reference to the GTC, the numbers submitted by the counterparty 
(usually volume and price) and the Long Description.  We've gone to some 
lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long 
Description contain all of the necessary terms.  It's not clear to me that we 
intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of 
Commercial Terms.  Are these transactions not intended to be binding until 
the confirmation is signed?  Any thoughts on this?

Mark - 

Last week Dale Neuner was requested to add four new commodities to on-line 
trading and Mike Robison and Steve Elliott have reviewed and approved the 
long descriptions for benzene, mixed xylene, toluene and methanol.   We have 
also finalized the form of GTC's for EPC (who trades benzene, xylene and 
toluene) and are forwarding them to you for further distribution.

 

Note:  GTC's for Enron Clean Fuels Company (who trades methanol) will follow 
on Wednesday.

Thanks.

Yes, I think they could develop some initial thoughts with that kind of 
description.

It sounds like it may be a little while before the IT group gets the final 
approval to move the web site to the outside.  In the mean time, is it worth 
while to send Sullivan&Cromwell print outs of the pages?  Right now there is 
not really much info on the site.  We can identify third party links, the 
type of information we will be providing as well as sources for our data.  
Will this be of use?

Mike

I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & 
Cromwell in NY) can't.  Any way for them to get access so they can advise us 
on this?  They are also the guys who will help with a training session on 
various legal issues and company policies in trading.

Mark,

As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site:   
http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/
It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let 
me know if it doesn't work.  

The User ID is: "user1"  and the Password is:  "test"  .

I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our 
information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements.

In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a 
limited customer listing.

Company Press Release

SOURCE: Enron Corp.

Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; Provides
Business Overview and Goals for 2000

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its 
annual equity analyst conference today in
Houston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the 
conference by highlighting Enron's tremendous
growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to 
shareholders over the past decade. 

     Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
     Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
     Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
     Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a 
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business

Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, 
Enron's largest business. Wholesale energy
growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing 
deregulation of power markets in the United States and
large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron 
expects to continue to broaden its early lead
across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. 
Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale
presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be 
permitted to choose their electricity provider in March
2000.

EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are 
generated through this innovative, Internet-based
transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline 
and over 10,000 transactions have been
completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, 
EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. 
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are
significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction 
methods.

Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with 
expansions planned or underway on several of its
systems.

Retail Energy Services

With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place 
to service customers worldwide. As the strong
contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly 
increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services'
goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future 
expenditures by customers for energy and energy
services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services

The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, 
reflects its role in the very fast growing market
for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global 
broadband network controlled by software
intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional 
point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to 
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform
for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband 
content delivery.

A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills 
from its energy businesses, bandwidth
intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives 
for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide
premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and 
large broadband file transfer, with differentiated
levels of quality in a usage-based business model.

As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun 
Microsystems that provides for accelerated
development of broadband Internet services.

Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and 
communications companies. The company, which owns
approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces 
electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and
operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and 
financial and risk management services to customers
around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to 
facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address is
www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.''

This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of 
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes 
that its expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. 
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include 
political developments in foreign countries, the ability to
penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband 
services markets, including the energy outsource
market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in 
prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and
those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of 
changes in interest rates, the timing and success of
Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, 
communications, internet- related and other infrastructure
projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the 
periods covered by the forward looking
statements.

I tried to send this to your juno address and it came back.  Just in case you 
are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes 
ago:
Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.  He will appear 
on "Our World" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m. CST to discuss Enron's year-end 
financial and operating highlights.  
	
	

I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how 
well it worked for you to recieve them.  I took a roll of film to be 
developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as 
well as prints.  I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send 
to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll.

In case you are looking for value stocks to evaluate, this is the list of

Idon't mean to recommend any of these - particualrly since the Smith Barney 
people have told me they have lost confidence in this particular manager and 
are looking for another one.

Apparently our people are already working with Louise Kitchen.  The issue I

I talked to Louise Kitchen (MD Enrononline) about how our group could  
leverage on  enrononline for  our plans of a first step with an informational 
site in Colombia  to move  later to a transactional site as Enron stars  
trading activities in Colombia.

What I proposed to Louise is to  get  ISA to include enrononline in the 
"other sites of interest" data  for  Colombia and to also have enrononline to 
include data on Colombia in the enrononline informational site .  She says 
that it is very easy to include this information  and that in principle she 
doesn't  think there is a problem in linking enrononline to ISA if it is 
going to be only for the informational site.  

She referred me to Rahil Jafry (content) to discuss the process to make the 
Colombia information to be included in the site. I talked to him and we 
scheduled a meeting for Friday at 8:30AM.

Please confirm ASAP if you will be available for this meeting

Thanks, Maria Elena

Thanks for forwarding on the MSJ opinion.  Any objection to my sending it on 
to our US counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell) who are coordinating many of these 
issues for us?

In US financial trading (derivatives) we send the attachment each time, but 
it should only be 4 or 5 pages long.  This may be different in the physical 
trading world - I'll check into it.

Thank you  Louise,

Just one remark which came back to me already a couple of time.

When we close a transaction with our normal counterparties, why do we need to 
send the GTC each time since when we close OTC witrh these same 
counterparties, this is not necessary ?

They are finding that our confirmations are 13 pages long for a single swap. 
Do you think we could avoid sending the GTC for some of our most active 
counterparties ?

Raphael

This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues 
related to EOL trades with Aquilia 

The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team 
regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia 
Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia 
Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, 
Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been 
notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk 
will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the 
counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these 
were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed.  

Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) 
Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues.  

Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia 
Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the 
effort to getting the invoices to the correct office.  

I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia 
Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like 
clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for 
Physical deals.  

Thanks,
KC

Glad you liked them.  Yes, cats do seem to like to explore all sorts of 
spaces - grocery bags are always a good bet.  I remember Dusty, the cat we 
had in Bethesda, used to like to sleep at the foot of my bed - under the 
covers.  Go figure.  I'd be happy to send you acopy of the photo of me.

And yes again, the online platform mentioned in the analyst's report is the 
system I've spent so much time on over the last nine months or so.  It's kind 
of exciting to see a project in print like that but now it means we have to 
really make it work!

I received the package from MetLife on the Long-Term Care insurance.  I had a 
couple of questions which I called the company about (premiums, pre-tax vs. 
after tax, etc.) and would be happy to go over it with you.  Do you want me 
to send the stuff to you or should we just chart about it frst?

Love, Mark

II have tried to approve this through the Data Manager - not sure if it 
worked.

I know we must have been through this any number of times before but each 
time I read one of these I wonder how we are supposed to figure out the 
Notional Quantity.  It says "calculated from the volume submitted by 
Counterparty on the website" but how do we know how to calculate it?  Where 
does it say whether that number is a daily or monthly number?  Gallons or 
Barrels?  I remain confused.

I've created a new Product Type - Jet Kero Financial Swap. The automatic 
e-mail notification isn't working so I won't know if you go in and approve 
the product. Please review the attached, as well as the below Long 
Description, and offer you approval/comments. (You will find it in the 
Partially Approved section - as credit has offered their sign-off). As you 
could imagine trading is eager to get this out on the web.

and I'll send that to you for review.

Trading wants to conduct Basis Swaps of Last Day NYMEX vs the Gas Daily 
Average of ANR Louisiana. I've created the below language accordingly and 
would like for you to review. The words in BOLD were added to make this 
'work'.

Index:  NYMEX HH L1/GD ANR LA
Abbreviation: GD ANR-LA
Sort Code: 1210
Description: The Fixed Price shall be the settlement price for the last 
scheduled Trading Day of the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract, 
modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the website, for the 
applicable Determination Period. [Is this for the contract for delivery 
during the Determination Period - in which case maybe we should say "for 
delivery during the applicable Determination Period"?] The Floating Price for 
the applicable Determination Period shall be the average of the Daily 
Midpoint prices published on each calendar day during such Determination 
Period under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Louisiana - Onshore 
South, ANR section of Gas Daily, or if Gas Daily is not published on a 
calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily 
Midpoint price published on in the next suceeding issue of Gas DailyBusiness 
Day. [Do we have a problem if the next price published is int he following 
calendar month?]

Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article?  

The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity 
numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers 
from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the 
transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers 
much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly 
disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if 
you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy 
derivatives markets that would be helpful.

Judith Schlesinger
01/25/2000 09:42 AM
Mark,

I found an article in Risk, April 1999 titled "Banking on energy derivatives: 
Brokers are acting more and more like investment banks, designing structured 
trades and bundled risk management solutions.  Nowhere is the trend more 
clear than in the energy markets."   Also,  the attached reports describe the 
OTC market.  Please let me know where to go from here.

Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone 
thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we 
want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, 
etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities 
within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.

Let me know what you think.

Just a couple of comments and questions:

Is it appropriate to refer to these as "US" transactions since the prices are 
clearly from outside the US?  I recognize that ENA is the counterparty but I 
think this may be confusing to our customers.

The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but 
it's defined with reference to NY & Houston banks being open - does that work 
for pulp transactions?].

I'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract 
period on the Pulpex description - is that what we use for current 
confirmations?

In the definition of the Index for the Finnish product, the word "relevent" 
should be deleted.

Dale Neuner on 01/25/2000 03:45:55 PM

We have created two new Pulp Products, on based on the PIX, one the Pulpex. 
PLease review and offer comments/approval.

I glanced at the power product description (what I could see of it) - Is it 
definately a physical transaction?  where does the power get delivered?  If 
it really is physical, I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to 
look it over.

Dale Neuner on 01/25/2000 02:30:10 PM
Two new Product Types have been created and require approval. In the 
DataManager you will find:

US Jet Kero Fin Swap - which you will find in Partialy Approved

and

US West Power Phy Spd - which you will find in Awaiting Approval.

The automated e-mail function associated with the notification of parties 
when a Product Type is created or approved is not functioning, and we are

Types and send me an e-mail when you are done.

I have enlisted the assistance of Carol St. Clair to handle the ETA comments 
and negotiations.  I will be meeting with her this afternoon to go over the 
details of what we have been doing so far.  It would make sense for you to 
meet her at some point in the near future.  She is not a junior lawyer by any 
stretch and should be able to handle most issues that come up with minimal 
assistance.  In fact, as she becomes more familiar with EOL and its 
structure/issues generally, she will make a great back-up for me for all EOL 
issues.

so we can get people on the system immediately.

with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of 
me.

It's finally winter here, too.  Of course that's nothing compared to you guys 
- it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.  It's 
only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.  Brrrr.  It was probably 
pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they 
could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were 
originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot 
were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been 
packed!).

Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling 
lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam 
mid-March.  I may try and get to South America sometime in February but 
nothing is scheduled yet.

Love, Mark

Sorry for the delay - our general policy is (and the first response to this 
type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not 
possible to provide for different online contracts for different 
counterparties.  Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has 
raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to 
a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms 
of the ETA.  So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens 
to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal 
department.  They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459).

Hello Mark,

I am trying to follow up on Remedy Tk ( 54001 ). I opened this Tk for this

Hello Mark, 
Please advise me on this matter and let me know if you want me to follow up

My manager had a question concerning the ETA's and if they can be modified
if our Lawyers have comments or changes that they would like to make.
Thanks

Any concerns?

The EOL help desk received a call from Isabelle Ealet at J Aron in London 
(0171 774 2103).  She was asking them why she could not trade with her id and 
password that she had been given.

I called her and explained that she could not use a Guest Id to trade and 
told her that she needed to send in a UK PA (explained to her the location of 
the form on the web site).  She said she would send one to us.

Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New 
York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub 
user.  She then told me that she transacted a deal in London for EN590.  I 
told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood 
this ?

Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ?  
Please advise as to how we are to deal with this.

Thanks

Happy 1999 and welcome back.  Sorry to hear about your travel problems.  I 
know how much fun a night in the airport can be.  I'd be happy to talk about 
the US commodity laws at one of our group meetings.  I'm going to be in 
London the last week of this month - maybe we can set something up for then?

I've been thinking about what we could cover at our London trading meeting 
every Tuesday and thought it would be a good idea if we could get you to give 
the group a 15-20 minute overview of US commodities law. I think this would 
be particularly helpful for our newest members, Robert Quick and Mark 
Elliott. Please let me know what you think. Thanks!

Yes, thanks - I think Tana is going to call to get some help interpreting the

Do we know where J Aron wants us to settle the trade done from London?  If it 
is still settled by payment to New York, this one trade probably does not 
cause too much heartburn. (See the note from Steve Douglas in Tax next 
following.)
Yes.  Our tax compliance system is premised upon the trading "pattern" (type 
of trader, location, etc.) represented to us in the materials pursuant to 
which we establish a counterparty.  In this case, J Aron is transacting via 
either a different legal entity in London or a branch of the entity that was 
initially approved that is located in London with a password acquired on the 
basis that they would be trading from New York (presumably from a U.S. 
corporation).  In either event, while there may not be an issue as to this 
particular transaction, because we do not know the type of counterparty with 
whom we are transacting, we could potentially have a U.S. tax withholding 
issue when settlement payments are made (this, of course, assuming that we 
settle with the London branch/entity trading with the U.S. approved 
password).  Consequently, we would prefer to more tightly contain the trading 
patterns of counterparties and not permit this type of trading (doesn't this 
violate reps made in the GTC?).  Alternatively, if all that is occurring is 
that a U.S. approved counterparty is using a password to transact from a 
different physical location, this presents an issue for the counterparty 
(namely, creation of a taxable presence in London or such other location) 
but, so long as we only settle with the approved counterparty under the terms 
pursuant to which their account was set up (i.e., in the U.S. in the case of 
this transaction), this should not present an issue for EOL.  Give me a call 
should you want to follow up.  Steve.

We have asked the EnronOnline team to send the Master User ID and Password to 
the person who signed the PA.  Our theory was that the signer presumably has 
the authority to bind the counterparty and understands that any holder of the 
password can also bind the counterparty.  If they want to give it to someone 
else, so be it.  But we should not be taking it upon ourselves to send the 
password to someone else unless we have conducted the same level of due 
diligence on that name as we have on the PA signer.  I was told we were not 
looking into the authority of the "nominated" Master Users inn any way but 
that we were taking some steps to verify the authority of the PA signers.  It 
just seemed safer to me to take this approach.

The package you sent arrived today.  I'll open it when I get home.

I sent the MetLife insurance materials by regular mail today.

These look ok to me but I think somebody who knows what they're talking about

Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the 
NYMEX on Friday morning.  It's possible (although not likely) that Dan 
Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very 
unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that 
message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether 
their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware 
of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not 
our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just 
wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if 
Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.

I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC 
currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner 
Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the 
calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall 
background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can 
do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo 
time in the Commissioner's face.  What do you think?

The Thursday times look better for me.

This may be one of the things we have to deal with in connection with the SA 
restructuring.  In the past it was easy enough to justify using Don's budget 
since in theory all of your work was for his benefit.  Now it isn't quite so 
clear.  I think we need to figure out exactly who you are supporting - is 
there a separate RC for Argentina trading?

Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Hi Brent!

Quick question.  In the past I have been charging your expenses to RC 0303 
which is Don Black's and Scott  Neal's RC.  You are listed in the system as 
having RC 0807.  Which should I be using?  Should your expenses come out of 
Don's and Scott's budget or yours?

Dear Schuyler:

It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney
people on swap documentation.  We used to send our new lawyers and more
experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more
experienced lawyers to the advanced course.  It appears that Euromoney
is no longer putting this on.  Are you doing something similar through
another provider?

Mark Taylor

The system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could 
probably draft around it on a case by case basis.  It strikes me that while 
we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, 
the credit considerations are more problematic.  I would guess that the back 
office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the 
trades.  This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some 
respects.  When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit 
was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the 
appropriate headroom.  I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom 
for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would  that be 
acceptable to everyone?  Another possibility is for the fund to set up a 
master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to 
back deals with whichever entities need the allocations.  That would let them 
do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other 
entities.  Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for 
credit on its own somehow.  Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would 
be difficult (upstream guarantee problems).

   
	
	

We have been talking to some of the hedge funds concerning EOL.  They want 
the ability to allocate transactions between legal entities.  They do not 
want to have different ID's and make seperate transaction for each entity 
(during which time the price could move) in order to self allocate.  Do you 
have any ideas on how we can facilitate this?

We met with the commercial team this afternoon and I was able to piece 
together the following:

Access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the EnronOnline 
(note spelling) trading page.

Most users of the site will already be signed up for EnronOnline - both a PA 
and ETA executed.

Other users will be given a user ID and password that give them "guest" 
access to EnronOnline and trading access to the auction page.

On the auction page the users may submit their offers to transact (either to 
buy or sell) with Enron.  The page will list a reserve price and identify the 
number of credits to be auctioned.  We are willing to commit to transact up 
to that number with the best bidders (at or beyond the reserve  price) but 
may transact larger volumes if we choose.

Users' offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period (this 
time frame remains a bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more) 
and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of 
winning bidders.

Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full 
amount of their offer to buy.

It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just 
the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction 
period but we would like to have that option.

I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor.  Harry is 
preparing the "GTC" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on 
our standard contracts for these products.  We need to put the legal 
framework together for the rest of it.  If the existing PA and ETA are 
adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind.  
We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of 
paper.  It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't 
matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to 
master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those 
counterparties would make sense.  

Can we talk on Monday?

under and RC/Cost Center I would be using?  Should I use Enron Expat Services 
and the RC number used for my payroll or ENA or ESA?  I don't remember how 
this was allocated last year.   Thanks.

Jan:  Thanks for your note.  Tim Belden has asked Dana to book a conference 
room - maybe you can coordinate with her.  It might also be nice if there is 
a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the 
morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.  The only 
people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer 
with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  We will have a better idea of any 
audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date.

meeting, please let me know.  I would be happy to assist.  

The second product listed here is physical.  It looks ok to me but I don't 
really know - can you take a look and approve it or comment to Dale please?

Thanks!

Jeff -  Dick Jenkins would like to commence trading on US Nat Gas Phys Index

 Brad Mckay has also set Tetco M3 up as a US Nat Gas Financial Swap product.

Please approve their request to transact on these products.

Mark - the Nat Gas traders would like to commence trading a daily Physical 
Index product based on Gas Daily - Henry Hub. Please review the attached and 
approve/offer comments.

I have not received any comments.  I consider it final.  Let me know if you 
need to have it customized for any particular circumstance.  Since I don't 
know who (or for that matter what) the PCG heads are, I sugggest that if they 
need it you send them copies.

Please let me know when you consider this letter finalised - one of us should 
send copies to the PCG heads.

Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone 
thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we 
want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, 
etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities 
within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.

Let me know what you think.

Here is S&C's first draft.

Mark Haedicke and I are scheduled to participate in an ISDA sponsored 
conference call which begins at 9:00 Eastern time tomorrow morning.  If that 
call runs over, we may not be able to call you promptly at 10:00 but will 
call as soon as we can.

Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the 
"auction procedures" set out on the bid page, immediately above the "submit" 
button.  As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the 
counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.  Here 
is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve 
price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other 
parties.  It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will 
be conducted.  Is that correct?  Any suggestions/comments?

I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the 
commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but 
until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to 
come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next 
week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao 
Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri).

Here is my proposed response.  Let me know if you want to mention the last 
item or not.  Thanks.

Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on 
transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a 
supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing 
agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if 
overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we 
would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding 
Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in 
the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian 
issues as well.
Brent 

	Enron International
	

I agree.  One little comment.  Though the transactional legal work should 
remain in Argentina, as an exemption, I would suggest to use Brazilian 
resources for "project financeable" gas supply agreements.
Fede

Michael Guerriero

02/10/2000 05:50 PM

I like to convey my thoughts regarding Bolivia legal responsibilities in 
light of the recent adjustments in commercial responsibility for Bolivia gas 
supply. As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural gas 
supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved 
Gaby over to support the effort. 

In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercial 
markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I 
would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to John 
Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and 
purchases) remain in Argentina. 

I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise 
and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the 
project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be 
supported best with their respective local legal talent.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Word, you can see the changes and who made them.

I'm afraid I disagree with Justin but prefer not to do so publicly.  It seems 
to me we need a verifiable end time for the Auction Period and should choose 
a time and a time zone that makes sense for the traders and counterparties 
(presumably UK for EnBank but Central for emissions credits).

Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we 
should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are 
physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have 
access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade 
UK derivatives should have access.

Mark
David Forster
02/15/2000 10:14 AM
Justin,

I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict 
access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up 
the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit).

Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict 
access.

Thanks,

Dave

It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits 
but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.  They want this 
auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the 
auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the 
expiration time.  There is still no commitment to sell anything.  All 
transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.  I have taken a 
stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind.

Would you please check and see if we have any JEDI swaps wtih these 
counterparies?

I'm not sure which "process" you are referring to.  I have not yet seen a 
list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business 
relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal 
review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some 
potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those 
entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is 
unclear).  The "soft" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US.  
For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on 
both sides of the walls.

I'm not sure I agree with you.  There is a big difference between listing the 
price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) 
vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.  The almost public 
nature of the marketing  may influence whether or not the reference entity is 
happy with Enron trading the product.  Even if they are not affected in this 
way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high 
ground if the reference entity later decides to object.

I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use 
the camera - and thought you might like these.  Unfortunately the only shot 
on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the 
photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group 
shot.  There were several others that you can tell would have been great 
shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.  The sunset was taken during 
our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the 
picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing 
his lunch down below).

Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda?

Edmund:

Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of 
questions and minor points ont eh GTC - 

In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed 
confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
"deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

Mark

Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, 
and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes 
to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have 
marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small 
tidy-up changes as well.

I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes 
should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references 
to "the United States" in Section 11(B) should remain as references to "the 
United Kingdom" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.  Please let me know if 
this is unclear.

Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare 
amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local 
counsel.

Many thanks,

Edmund.

you do not have it, please let Marie Heard (x33907) know and she can get you

Have you had a chance yet to prepare a Master Swap Agreement yet for HL&P?  I

I received the proposed list of reference entities today.  Here is a draft of 
a memo that I cobbled together to use in trying to get input from others 
within Enron for the restriced list.  Would you let me know what you think?  
I will be meeting with Mark H. tomorrow to talk with him about it.  It isn't 
clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come.  Since the 
communications people may have relationships with some of these folks, is 
Kristina the right person?  I know that EES has some kind of joint venture 
with AOL - should Vicki sign off?  If it is going to such persons, should the 
memo come from Mark?  Cliff Baxter?  John Sheriff?  Jim Derrick?  

	ENRON 
	

As Enron's broadband services business grows, we will continue to position 
the company to take advantage of the significant opportunities in this market 
and meet the needs of our global customers.  With that in mind, we've made a 
number of changes within the Office of the Chairman of Enron Broadband 
Services aimed at providing a better focus on the key objectives of the 
organization.  

Joe Hirko and Ken Rice, previously co-CEOs of Enron Broadband Services, will 
continue to jointly manage the strategic direction of the company.  Joe will 
continue as CEO and will be responsible for the primary executive management 
of EBS as well as network build-out, BOS development, cross-market 
capabilities and staff functions.  Ken will assume the role of chief 
commercial officer and will be responsible for developing the commercial 
functions of the organization.
  
In addition, Kevin Hannon has been named chief operating officer and will be 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of EBS.  Kevin was most recently 
CEO of Global Risk Management and, prior to that position, he was president 
Please join us in congratulating Joe, Ken, Kevin and Greg in their new roles.

My recollection is that we did this on purpose - that the industry works this 
way for all participants (or nearly all) so we built our documents to reflect 
that practice.  Do I remember correctly?

All,

I am aware that early in the EnronOnline process, some GTC's were only 
generated for the "With Collateral" category and hence, all companies 
transacting in that commodity were subject to the collateral clause.

I am now starting to wonder if this was an oversight, or if there is a reason 
why all counterparties should be bound by a collateral clause for the 
following GTC's/Products:

I would appreciate any insight which any of you can offer.

Thanks,

Dave

I just called Diomedes' office to try and get on his calendar next week.  
They told me he is not there and won't be back until after Carnival which I 
guess means March 9 at the earliest.  I am in Portland the 6th & 7th (Mon. & 
Tues.) and Amsterdam the 13th - 17th (Tues. - Fri.).  Unless an emergency 
comes up it looks like the earliest I can reasonably expect to make it will 
be towards the end of March (27 - 31?).

Mike will be here next Thursday and Friday.  I am not sure of anyone's 
schedule in Sao Paulo.  Please note though that Mike has scheduled an offsite 
for BA office next Friday afternoon to discuss the goals for this next 
year.   No one will be around the office most of Friday.  Does it make sense 
to flip the order of visits?

Mark Taylor@ECT

I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the 
commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but 
until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to 
come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next 
week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao 
Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri).  

Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
02/14/2000 10:53 AM
Here is my proposed response.  Let me know if you want to mention the last 
item or not.  Thanks.

Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on 
transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a 
supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing 
agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if 
overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we 
would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding 
Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in 
the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian 
issues as well.
Brent 

	Enron International
	

I agree.  One little comment.  Though the transactional legal work should 
remain in Argentina, as an exemption, I would suggest to use Brazilian 
resources for "project financeable" gas supply agreements.
Fede

Michael Guerriero

02/10/2000 05:50 PM

I like to convey my thoughts regarding Bolivia legal responsibilities in 
light of the recent adjustments in commercial responsibility for Bolivia gas 
supply. As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural gas 
supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved 
Gaby over to support the effort. 

In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercial 
markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I 
would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to John 
Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and 
purchases) remain in Argentina. 

I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise 
and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the 
project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be 
supported best with their respective local legal talent.

Please let me know your thoughts.

I just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make 
sure the second item listed in them works.  Is everyone comfortable that the 
volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce 
megawatt hours?  I think it works but I had to work through it to get there - 
it wasn't immediately obvious to me.

These are more names  for European reference credits which Brian intends to 
trade offline.  With the exception of two names ( TXU Europe and Helsinga 
Energia) the names look OK to me.  (They are all either publicly rated 
investment grade names or e - rated 5+ subs of major groups).  Are there any 
names here that you have an issue with ?

Dear All,

Attached is a list of 49 additional reference credits that we want to quote

Equity and Debt Trading would like to have an "exploratory" conversation to 
consider the potential economic benefits/impact of offshore investing.  To 
support an offshore investment fund we would need to have offshore originated 
dollars.   Jeff Kinneman has suggested that we get individuals from 
Accounting, Treasury, Tax and Legal with commercial for a initial discussion.

We are trying to set up a meeting over the next two weeks to discuss.  Kelly 
Templeton will be calling you to set up a meeting.  If another person is more 
appropriate, please let me know or tell Kelly Templeton when she calls.

Many thanks.

Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed 
in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.  There were also several 
from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.  I'll 
try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat 
Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light).

Carol:

As Tana mentioned in our meeting, the Credit guys are in discussions with 
Aspect as to who should be the counterparty to the swap (we think it should 
be JEDI, they think it should be ECT).

There is a master agreement in place between JEDI I and Inland (which 
suggests that there is probably a swap in place that maybe should have been 
transferred and still binds JEDI I).

Any chance we have any flexibility on ATT, Lucent, Air Products, Dow, DuPont, 
GE, IMC, Minnesota Mining&Mfg., Pitney Bowes, Praxair, Sprint.  We only have 
5 that we can take off without needing to put additional names up?

   
	
	

Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed 
in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.  There were also several 
from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.  I'll 
try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat 
Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light).

For your approval,

Eklavya.

What is the list of proposed Reference Entities for EnronOnline (to go live 
March 8?)?

Richard - do we have a policy regarding questions concerning pending 
litigation?  How should we handle these?

Mark,

I would appreciate your comments on the following FAQ's, intended to be a 
guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the 
injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please 
let me know.

Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' 
absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on 
Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls 
before then).

Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline?
A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of 
EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff.

Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Agency was involved in developing.

Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Enron developed.

Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency?
A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without 
authorisation from Enron.

Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit?
A We are not releasing that information at this time.

Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged 
the competitive lead of EnronOnline?
A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the 
terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information 
is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined.

Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies?
A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which 
can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the 
actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very 
capable IT consultancy companies.

Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided?
A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but 
are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual 
contributors.

Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other 
companies looking to build something like EnronOnline?
A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com.

Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information 
into a public forum.
A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our 
contractor does not seem to have been upheld.

Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction?
A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information.

Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you 
also filing a lawsuit?
A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is 
found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has 
already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate.

Peter:

I understand from Tana that you disagree with the advice we have received 
from outside counsel (Stikeman) regarding the necessary 
procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as 
collateral in Canada.  We are in the process of revising our Canadian forms 
for ISDA master agreements and credit support annexes.  Would you mind 
checking into this issue - maybe by discussing your difference of opinion 
with Stikeman (I think the advice came from Fred Erickson in their Calgary 
office)?  I don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens 
on ourselves that aren't required by law.

Thanks,

Mark

Do any of you guys know about this deal?

Mark,

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Cheers

Scott,

in Cynthia's absence, can you allocate someone else from your group to 
oversee this? As you can see, we are in need of some immediate assistance on 
Whitewing.

Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux? Can you help 
out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor 
and Jeff Hodge?

Thanks.

Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram 
below.

With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  
The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from 
Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from 
Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, 
is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need 
to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the 
definition of "Indebtedness" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP 
Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE 
Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into 
issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they 
will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of 
who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss 
the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to 
open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to 
revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy 
task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need 
to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require 
Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A 
final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be 
responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.

More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with 
respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?

If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll 
be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time 
discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next 
week.

Best regards,

Stuart

As you may recall, the tax comments to the debt term sheet reflected a need 
for an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement to admit ENA as a 
partner. You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for 
legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such 
amendment.  So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you 
please consider the following:

1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from 
an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement?

2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues?

3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA's 
preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the 
necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken?

4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the 
amendments?  Will it be the Margaux legal team?  The Houston Global Finance 
legal group?  Other??

Thanks, in advance, for your consideration of these issues.

Kindest Regards,

DMD    

Paul - 

Thanks for your voice mail.  We can't print the list of Reference Entities 
from the website because we have not been given access.  We do need to get 
that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the 
list that Michael referred to.  

The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final 
list of Reference Entities for their launch.  That list absolutely must be 
scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.

Dear Mark,

Hope you are well!

I've attached the confirmation for the EOL bankruptcy swaps where ENA will be

Thanks - I needed a good smile today.

Edmund:

Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of 
questions and minor points ont eh GTC - 

In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed 
confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
"deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

Mark

Edmund Cooper
02/15/2000 10:29 AM
Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, 
and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes 
to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have 
marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small 
tidy-up changes as well.

I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes 
should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references 
to "the United States" in Section 11(B) should remain as references to "the 
United Kingdom" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.  Please let me know if 
this is unclear.

Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare 
amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local 
counsel.

Many thanks,

Edmund.

Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?  That is, from the 
contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the 
dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the 
following day.  Sort of an internal vs. external issue.

   

Do you have any issues with this?  (see below)

Thanks!
Sheri

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed 
aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

Mark,

I recall at one time, we were concerned that Credit Derivatives could be 
considered to be insurance, and therefore we would come under certain 
regulations. I assume this was resolved to our satisfaction?

Dave

Richard:

In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration 
in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to 
judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the 
jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in 
civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts 
generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap 
agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK 
agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts 
(where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our 
policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I 
would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely 
enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

Thanks,

Mark

Bryan - 

In fact, in order to get this first list of 200 or so on the 
non-transactional web page, we conducted only a very brief legal review in 
Houston - th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a 
variety of people.

I suggest choosing the reference credits for online trading from the already 
approved reference credits which appear on EnronCredit.com.  My recollection 
is that there currently is not a separate approval process from either a 
credit or legal perspective.  Let's review everything for EOL prior to the 
states getting to the office on Monday and get an email out with the list of 
reference credits.

New reference entities - as with any other new Products, should be submitted 
to the Product Control Group (Amita Gosalia).

The PCG will then be responsible for the text of the new Products and 
obtaining the necessary approvals.

However, in accordance with our discussions with Bryan, EnronOnline will be 
limited to 20 reference entities until after we have settled on the credit 
derivatives update/volume requirements, which may or may not feed into a 
phase 2 development of the EnronOnline site.

regular and smooth approval of new reference names, a checklist if you will.

Attached is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline. Of immediate 
concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next 
week. Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments. These are in the 
annexes to the advice. Following are my comments

Password Agreement  - Fine, seems a good to give address for notices etc.

ETA - I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under 
Australian law. The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a 
near opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3(c) I 
believe we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron 
acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have 
been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality.

GTCs - Minor changes. The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to 
the  collateral clause. Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs 
for different counterparties

As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the 
ETA for inclusion in Road Show. I expect to settle the advice early week  and 
will circulate it.

Please find attached a further draft of the advice marked up to show the
changes made from the previous draft. <<0437047.DOC>>

In particular please note:

* that we have suggested amendments to the agreements in the schedule
- if these are acceptable for use we will accept the revision mode in the
final version.  If they are not, please let us know.
* as certain negative prices are now possible, it is expected that an
AFMA endorsed amendment to the clause relating to negative prices and market
disruption events will be prepared - this would need to be included in the
GTCs (and your ISDAs)
* it would not seem practical to include the collateral language in
the GTCs only in respect of some clients (as the GTCs are standard
provisions).  Would collateral arrangements in relation to particular
clients using GTCs be best documented separately?
* will offers on EnronOnline be considered by a EAF trader in
Australia before being accepted?
* the trade practices material can be completed whenever it is
convenient for one of our trade practices lawyers to review the working site
as a whole.

Best regards

I assume this means that none of the 50 customers on the original Customer 
Profile list for Credit Derivatives can be located in Canada or Germany . . .

Dave

There are still certain jurisdictions where we are not offering the product: 
Germany and Canada come to mind.

David Forster
02/25/2000 04:10 PM
Mark,

I recall at one time, we were concerned that Credit Derivatives could be 
considered to be insurance, and therefore we would come under certain 
regulations. I assume this was resolved to our satisfaction?

Dave

It never ends.

Can we start thinking about this?

Also Dave please chase Bryan again if we haven't received anything as John 
spoke to Mark who said everything is ready?

Do you want legal bills for this aspect of the project sent through on the 
EnronOnline work order or separately?

Thanks for your card and hello to the whole family.  I didn't know you guys 
were in Mass.  Is this a long term move?  Things are still pretty much the 
same in Houston.  We'd certainly look forward to seeing more of you down this 
way!

As we discussed, attached is the new list of proposed reference entities.  I 
have also attached my previous memo outlining the propsosed business and our 
concerns.  

Can we do the call at 3:00 Houston time?

Sara Shackleton
02/28/2000 04:18 PM
Brent, Andrea and I were hoping you might be available for a 30-minute call 
on Tuesday after 5pm (BA time) or 2pm (Houston time) on Tuesday, Feb. 29.  
The BA office had a meeting last Friday afternoon and has apparently set some 
rather lofty goals, such as online trading for Q3, etc.  Please let me or 
Brent know if you are available and/or alternative times.  

Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed. with Marval and 
the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants.  
Also, I need to talk with you about Brazil when I return.  Sami has been 
diligent about forwarding deal flow information and there are a ton of 
references to PPA's and SWAPS.  We are still trying to get our arms around 
all the business units in Brazil to track their activity.  Have you heard 
from Yao?  This international position may be right up his alley. Sara 

I'll be there - is it really only to last 2 hours?

Louise Kitchen

We are planning to hold a meeting to kick off  the Phase 2 project of 
EnronOnline on 3rd March in Houston.  This meeting will focus on the new look 
for the site and content to be added based on our own thoughts and the 
feedback from customers and our own trading desks. 

A draft agenda is as follows

Place:   Doubletree Hotel
 LaSalle A 
 400 Dallas Street 
 Houston
 Texas
 
Start: 10:00 - 12:00

Presentations will include:

1.  Phase 1.1+  Changes to the current system based on trader and customer 
feedback and issues.
2. Phase 2
 (i)  Technical
 (ii)  Content & Community 

Look forward to seeing you.  Please reply to Lydia Cannon as to your 
attendance.

Why is Enron's stock so volatile now? Since today's session started, ENE
     has lost another $2.50!

     Mr. Ken Lay replies
     I haven't had a chance to check our stock today, but I think for several 
reasons
     it's more volatile. But before I comment on that, our stock price is 
still up even
     if it went down that much today. It's up 40% since the beginning of the 
year
     when the Dow was down. As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up
     about 75%. That's one reason why it's so volatile. Some people bought in
     along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the
     uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off 
the
     table. As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a 
growth
     stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility, 
just like all
     the other companies that fit into that category. Throughout the market,
     technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but 
often
     $10-$12-$15 a whack. What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility 
on the
     upside, but I hate it on the down side. 

     We've had a change in the ownership of our stock. Increasingly, it's 
being
     bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being 
sold by
     the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower
     valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and 
put it
     back into lower P/E stocks. I know this makes everybody a little 
nervous, but
     this is probably the world we're in now. I'd rather be in this world 
with a 50 P/E
     than the more stable world with a 20 P/E.

this is pretty funny.. sorry that it didn't come out as a clean print; its
a forward of a forward (so on ...)
this is rated G!

I have explained to Bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference 
entities for trading on EnronOnline will be a lengthier process than that 
which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the EnronCredit.com 
page.  That process is now underway.  Going forward, I would hope that we 
will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites 
before a reference entity is used.

David Forster
02/28/2000 07:03 PM
It is my understanding that the EnronOnline approval process is separate and 
approval for EnronCredit.com does not automatically mean approval for 
EnronOnline.

Debbie/Mark: Can you confirm or refute my understanding?

Thanks,

Dave

Bryan Seyfried
02/28/2000 12:26 PM
Attached is the current list of reference credits which are posted on 
EnronCredit.com.  It is our understanding that we can quote any of these via 
EnronOnline subject to approval from the EOL team.  Pls. confirm this 
understanding to all of us but especially mssrs. dilworth and forster

I'm not sure anyone told you about this - can you make it on Friday? 
David Forster
03/01/2000 09:30 AM
There has been some confusion as to the schedule for Thursday and Friday.

Thursday is intended to be used to review presentations and concepts and 
generally prepare for the larger Friday meeting. As of yet, we have not 
scheduled any formal meeting times on Thursday.

Friday is the "official" presentation day. Although the core group can expect 
to be offsite for the entire day, other non-EnronOnlinians will only be there 
from 10 am to 12 pm. These two hours will contain the most critical phase 2 
information and discussions and will follow this agenda (incorporating 
various presentations/parts of presentations as decided on Thursday):

 1.  Phase 1.1+  Changes to the current system based on trader and customer 
feedback and issues.
 2. Phase 2
 (i)  Technical
 (ii)  Content & Community 

Dave

I'm not sure what "penalites" they're referring to.  I assume it's a physical 
concept.   If we trade power with these guys I guess you would be the right 
person.  If it's gas, probably Stacy.

Was wanting more details on penalties for EnronOnline.  I was only able to 
refer him to Legal.

I had passed on your name and told Jim, either you or someone from our legal 
department would
follow up with him.

Thanks for your help!

failure by Enron or the parties doing business on EOL for particular gas 
trading points.  I have heard verbally from the Calgary office what they 
consider the penalties to be, however, I haven't seen anything in writing.  I 
assume that unless parties have agreed to these stated penalies, the 
penalties would then fall under existing trade agreements.   Is this correct, 
and is Enron working on specific penalty provisions for EOL deals?

Please give me a call and we can discuss.  Shari is now definately moving to 
power trading (not public yet) so we really need to figure out how we are 
going to cover all the bases - short and long term.  I will be out the 14th 
through the 17th and plan to be in S.A. the last week in March.  It would be 
grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more 
pertinent to our issues) but I hate to think of Carol left all by herself 
that much.  Let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is 
covered.

Sara Shackleton
03/01/2000 07:43 AM
Mark:  I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss.  
There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the 
commercial group and the lawyers as follows:

1.  March 17 - Milbank Tweed  (Securitization)
2.  March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)

I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the 
start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 
28).  In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with 
Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.  Also, I can 
speak with commercial groups and plan a "swap"seminar for the commercial and 
legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio).  
Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you 
have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.  Sara

I am not available at all on Friday through Tuesday but the meeting can go 
ahead without me if necessary.

   

Unfortunately, Brent is triple-booked for the meeting below.  Would it be 
possible to reschedule to Friday at 9:00 a.m. Houston Time?

Please let me know ASAP!  Thank you!
-Becky

The South American Legal Team meeting will be held tomorrow.
 2:30 p.m. (Houston time)
 EB38c1

Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo will attend via telephone.

Here is a set of disclaimers for your website.  Have you looked into getting 
the name trademarked?  If not, let me know and I can try and move that along 
from here.

Sorry - it looks like I can not attend.  My travel schedule is pretty tight 
this month - do you think it makes sense to set something up for April?

   

will you be attending the dinner?
	
	

Mark Taylor called this afternoon to say that he had been asked by Steve 
Kean's office if he could attend an ACCF dinner with Rep. Charlie Stenholm on 
March 8 in Washington (in place of Mark Haedicke, who could not attend).  
Taylor is checking with Haedicke to see if he should attend, but Taylor also 
wanted to check with us to see if there were other things he could do in DC 
if he came on March 8 before the dinner (hill visits, CFTC?).

I told him I would pass the message along to you for consideration.   He 
should know by the end of the day today whether he will actually be attending 
the ACCF dinner or not.

David - 

I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan 
in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you 
have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this 
for Australia it would be very helpful to me.  I have what we've used in 
Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.

Thanks,

Mark

That's perfect - let's aim for May - thanks

   

Hi Mark...it's no big deal to miss this dinner.....for April, they adjourn 
for the Easter break on April 14th so it would have to be at the beginning of 
April.  I think it would be fine to wait until May, after Easter, if that 
fits with your schedule.  Just let me know what works for you.

Mark H. asked me to forward to you this initial draft term sheet.  We would 
like to talk to you, and presumably one of your colleagues, tomorrow 
regarding the possible antitrust implications of the proposed structure.  
Please give me a call and we can schedule a time.

Thanks,

Mark, give me a call.  Mark

Moses, Jesus and an old man are golfing. Moses steps up to the tee
and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in a
water trap. Moses walks down, parts the water and chips the ball onto
the green.

Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over
the fairway and lands in the water trap. Jesus just walks on the
water and chips the ball onto the green.

The old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing
over the fairway and heads for the water trap. But just before it 
falls into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth.
As the fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down 
and grabs the fish in its claws.  The eagle flies over the green, where 
a lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, 
the eagle drops the fish.  When the fish hits the ground, the ball 
pops out of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one.

Jesus turns to the old man and says, "Dad, if you don't stop fooling
around, we won't bring you next time."

Mark,

All systems ready to go on Friday morning.  I thus expect to be in the office 
on Monday morning (18 Jan.).  Could you please ask one of the assistants to 
help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of 
the requisite gear).  Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact 
with Houston H/R, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a 
car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on Monday morning).

I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the Legal Dept on 18 Jan.

Martin

Dave - Do we have a copy of this marked to show the changes fromt he NA ETA?

David Forster
02/29/2000 09:55 AM
Mark,

We have customers who are now filling out the new form of the Australian PA. 
As a result, we will need an Online Australian ETA very shortly.

Can you please approve/disapprove of the ETA form forwarded by David Minns? 
(copy attached). Once we have your approval, we will put it on the system.

Thanks,

Dave

I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only 
counterparties.  The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which 
will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement.

David Forster
02/29/2000 10:00 AM
Mark/Justin,

Attached is a copy of the Australian PA. It includes the addition of an 
Address for Service.

Do you think we should incorporate this in our other PA's as well?

I realise that in many instances we are already doing business with the 
relevant company - and the same or similar information might be included on 
the Registration form (where completed) - but are you concerned about 
ambiguity in the event that no Registration form is completed?

Also: We will need to have some way to distinguish PA's which arrive for 
customers who want access to Auctions only. What do you think about adding a 
statement like: "(Optional): Tick this box if you wish to have access only to 
EnronOnline auctions and not to the main transactions site"  [tick box].

If you wish to proceed with either of the above, we will need to revise all 
PA's and post them on the website.

Thanks,

Dave

May I also point out that we went to great pains to keep the PA to a single 
page.  This one looks like it runs over to the second page - at least as laid 
out here.  I was also under the impression that a completed registration form 
was required before a user ID and password could be issued.  While I don't 
object to having an address for notices on the PA, I don't think it is 
necessary in North America if we have a completed registration form.

Then from a legal perspective I don't have any issues.

   

You are correct - it only affects the booking of the deal.

Sheri

Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?  That is, from the 
contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the 
dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the 
following day.  Sort of an internal vs. external issue.

   

Do you have any issues with this?  (see below)

Thanks!
Sheri

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed 
aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

Mike - any potential problems with the DPR?
Peggy - we discussed briefly a few weeks back...any thoughts?  

Edmund - 

I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives 
(I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have 
attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I 
don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is 
already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only 
creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My 
other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is 
that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't 
think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can 
discuss my concerns?

Ken - here is another (brand new) issue Mark H. asked me to forward on to you 
that he would like to discuss this afternoon in the anti-trust call.

There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, 
Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to 
talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might 
propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for 
energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other 
companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for 
transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably 
discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.

What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?
What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?
Should legal counsel be in attendance?
Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?

This looks good to me.  Thanks!

Dear Mark,

Thanks for your thoughts and mark up.  I agree with the points that you 
make.  I've redone the definition which l think now covers the SP and BP 
amounts.  I've run it by Slaughter's and they are happy with it.  Let me know 
if you are and then we can knock it on the head!!

Best wishes, Edmund.

I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re: 
the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:

1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards 
the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be 
identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the 
proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  

2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have 
been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit 
notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal 
together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron 
relationships.

3. Legal conducts a "screening" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and 
forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If 
the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its 
affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the 
appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE 
the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the 
confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, 
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the 
"other Enron relationships" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.  
Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).

Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on 
the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only 
offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

Mark, herewith the list I referred to in my last email.  I've looked to see 
if there are any CAs with a Duke entity with an Enron European entity and

entities (rather than having it attacked contemporaneously on all sides by 
several departments).

Rod - can you tell me who the current proposed reference entity is and how it 
is related to the Duke companies that are parties to the confidentiality 
agreements listed below?  I need to know who the parents are and who the 
subsidiaries are and, if it is a subsidiary if it is a material sub of the

Martin:

My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for 
an office for you here on the 38th floor.  The room number is EB3850.  Sylvia 
is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office 
and will talk to HR about a badge.  HR should have the badge waiting for you 
at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.  If it isn't and your HR person is 
not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to 
let you in.  Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.  If you 
haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered 
lots near the building on Monday morning.  They are more reasonably priced 
than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you 
don't have a contract).  We're looking forward to seeing you!

Have a good trip.

All systems ready to go on Friday morning.  I thus expect to be in the office 
on Monday morning (18 Jan.).  Could you please ask one of the assistants to 
help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of 
the requisite gear).  Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact 
with Houston H/R, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a 
car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on Monday morning).

I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the Legal Dept on 18 Jan.

Martin

Since Leslie will be working from home during part of March, a move request 
has been made to replace Leslie's current equipment with the lap top located 
at EB3890.  The upgrade needs to be made to the lap top so she can run Live

Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy

Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  Duke Energy Trading & Marketing 
is a marketing sub and does not prepare separate financials.  The S&P rating 
is based on an implied guaranty from Duke Energy.  Legal would also need to 
review this counterparty from the standpoint of confidentiality agreement 
violations. 

Also, as a trading counterparty, Sempra Energy Trading is not authorized for 
credit derivative trading, because the existing guaranty does not explicitly 
cover this type of transaction.  If Sempra wishes to transact out of this 
entity, we can look into amending the guaranty to cover this product.  This 
will require legal efforts and approval.

Rod

Carol St Clair
03/02/2000 03:27 PM
Dave:
I've read the comfort letter.  With respect to item #1, the first paragraph 
is fine.  With respect to the second paragraph, what situation is he trying 
to address?  For example, I thought that in situations where the counterparty 
clicked on a price and the price changed in the counterparty's favor before 
the trade was executed, that the counterparty would get the better price.  
The second paragraph might negate this as written.  Can a situation really 
arise where the system misreads a counterparty's offer?  I think that we need 
to be very careful in what we say here.

With respect to point #2, I need to defer to Mark Taylor on this because I 
thought that the confirmations control, but it could be the case that our 
electronic records could prevail if there is a conflict between the 2.  That 
would seem to make sense to me but I would prefer that Mark concurred with 
this.

Bryan,

I believe Mark Taylor is out of the office until Wednesday.

At this point, I believe there are 6 approved Reference Entities for 
EnronOnline.

We will add more up to the previously discussed 20 as approvals are received.

Dave

Bryan Seyfried
03/05/2000 04:43 PM
After reviewing all of the lists, attached is the list of reference credits 
that I forwarded to Mark to load on Enorn Online.

Call me if you have any concerns.

Any idea what Bryan plans to gain this way?  It's not clear to me that a hard 
wall solves our problems with RE approvals but that's because I don't know.  
Maybe Ken can shed some light on this.

Paul Simons
03/07/2000 08:01 AM
FYI, there apppears to have been a sea change in Bryan's attitude to having a 
hard Chinese wall for his trans-atlantic credit trading group.  In short, he 
wants to be behind one and apparently John Sherriff is comfortable with 
this.  I have therefore asked Ken Raisler to advise us on how to construct a 
Chinese Wall from a practicle, US perspective, with the intention of having 
Sanjev at Slaughters modify the "instruction kit", as necessary, to work 
under English law.  Given Ken's involvement on equity trading, he appears to 
be the right place to start.  There remains the possibility that when the 
traders see the procedures they will change their minds and wish to stick 
with the existing procedures you have seen.

This will not impact launch of credit trading online which, as advised, is 
still set for tomorrow.

Please let me have any thoughts on this.

Regards

Paul

David - 

Thanks for your note.  Just to keep you posted - I plan to be there with my 
boat but will return to my slip at Kemah Harbor and drive over to the party 
so I won't add to the size of your raft.

Mark

David.Galloway@chron.com on 03/08/2000 11:37:51 AM
 Hi, folks.
 All of you have expressed an intent to bring your boats out to meet
New World on Saturday.  It's looking like we have about 32 boats coming out.
We're hoping to raft together as many as possible off the restaurant's dock.
I know some of you who have your own slips nearby will be taking your boats
home and driving over to the party.
 But we've had one skipper mention that he wouldn't be willing to
raft together with others out of fear for his thin, wooden hull.  We've
secured him a nearby slip, and we could come up with a few more if we must.
If for any reason you believe you cannot raft together with the other boats,
please let me know immediately, and I'll see what I can do.
 Also, if you haven't seen the plan (updated today), please visit
http://www.chron.com/content/interactive/voyager/sail/party/boats.html.
 Thanks.  And we'll see you on Saturday.

What time is the game on Saturday?

I have received reactions from several of the other Enron operating companies 
(EBS, EES and GPG) requesting that the following entities be placed on the 
Restricted List for credit derivatives Reference Entities:

AT&T Corp.
Baltimore Gas & Electric Company
Bell Atlantic Corporation
BellSouth Corp.
Cable & Wireless plc
Comdisco, Inc.
Cox Communications, Inc.
Intel
IBM
Lucent Technologies
Monsanto
SBC Communications
Sun Microsystems
Union Carbide
Viacom
Wisconsin Electric Power Company
Wisconsin Gas Company 

These companies were those on the attached list (forwarded to the various 
General Counsels on 2/28) which were found to be objectionable for one reason 
or another.  I have not yet heard from the former EI companies.

Mark - This doesn't look familiar to me - is it yours?
Please see attached Preliminary Agenda for the above meeting

(See attached file: Agenda 180199.doc)

Regards
 - Agenda 180199.doc

I have not been given any reasons - the most "considered" list came from EBS 
where I feel sure some of them were commercial.  I'm not so sure about the 
EES and GPG lists.  These lists are going to some fairly senior people.  I'm 
a bit hesitant to add to their workload if it isn't necessary.  My suggestion 
would be that we ask for reasons or maybe further research on only those you 
particularly want to list.

week.  Unfortunately we have not yet heard from them.  Alan Aronowitz has

Did we ever talk about this?  The traders (Bob Crane in particular) are 
giving Dale a hard time - they want to start trading this way immediately.

How about this?

Please forward to me a copy of whatever you would like to send before you=

send it.

Thanks,

Dave

Further to the recent queries you raised concerning the ETA, we can provide=
=20
you with the following comfort.  The final sentence of
 clause 2(d) prevents a Counterparty from claiming that the ETA has not bee=
n=20
duly accepted or an offer has not been validly made
 or that a transaction has not been validly entered into solely by virtue o=
f=20
the electronic =01&click=018 method of submitting offers or execution.=20

This same principle provides protection to you in that the only binding=20
transactions upon both yourselves and Enron are the ones in
 which certain terms have been clicked upon by you and the same terms=20
accepted by Enron through the automated EnronOnline process.
 The system is designed to ensure that BOTH PARTIES ARE BOUND BY the terms =
of=20
the offer you submit are the only terms=20
which ARE can be accepted by Enron. As a result, there have been no instanc=
es=20
in which a customer offered on one set of terms, but Enron
 accepted a different set of terms.

Just between you and me, I'm astonished -- delighted but astonished, that 
they fugured their way through all of those Japanese holidays and the 
aftermath.

I'm told that the advice from Japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but I 
haven't read it yet.  I don't anitcipate any problems.  I can't tell from 
these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on May 11 
or going live for Japanese counterparties then (all of whom must then have 
already executed PAs and been approved).

Mine is on 11 May.  Sounds like a good excuse for a party.

I am getting in touch with Thomas/Chismar in Singapore to ensure they are 
prepared.  Also our list of potential contacts is being refined and would 
hope to have it relatively complete by early next week.  Our local PR firm 
has suggested that we translate the basic EOL brochure into Japanese.  We are 
moving forward with this.  I do not expect to require any further 
localization at this point.  Our local attornies are getting back before the 
end of the week with final comments on the plan, contracts, etc.

Louise,

Given the comments below, could we move the roll out to 10-12 May?

Joe,

In talking with Nick yesterday evening, I learned that most people are off in 
Japan during the week of May 1.  April 29 and May 3 through 5 are all 
national holidays (Greenery Day, Constitution Day, National Holiday and 
Children's Day respectively).  Furthermore, Nick advises that many people 
start the holiday week early and stretch it into the following week.  This 
makes our selection of May 1 week for EOL a most unsatisfactory choice.   I 
would recommend that we shoot for May 10 or 11 (which would conflict with 
possible high profile participation in an APEC meeting, which I'll be 
managing) or preferably the week of May 15.  We could introduce EOL earlier, 
but publicity would be reduced given Rebecca's schedule for interviews and 
lead time for printing/mailing promotional packets.  It would be very tight, 
but we could do it the week of April 24.  Rebecca could provide overview 
interviews, supplemented by an EOL demonstration and your explanation of how 
this provides a platform to build our business.  Do you have 
preferences/limitations from a business activity perspective?  Unless you 
object, on Monday I'll get recommendations from our PR firm and also check 
Louise's availability/desire to be part of the EOL introduction.

John

Thanks very much Anita - that makes good sense to me.  I'll coordinate 
through QD.

Hi Mark -

Julia Deans from the QD Singapore office  got in touch with me this morning.  
Apparently Warren is in Tokyo on a work assignment until February so it won't 
be so easy to meet up with him as we'd hoped.  Warren  offered to  try and 
fly into Singapore this weekend to meet the 3 of us but I told Julia that I'd 
have to confer with you first when Houston opens today.  However,  following  
that conversation, Julia's note (see below)  came in. 

Seeing that Warren will be in your 'vicinity' next month - it certainly makes 
far more sense for him to wend his way to Houston in February so I shall tell 
Julia to shelve Warren's initial offer to fly into Singapore this weekend. 

I will forward Warren's academic details to you upon receipt from Julia.

Thanks,
Anita
Dear Anita,

It was good to talk to you this morning and I hope we will meet in person 
soon.  In the meantime, I wanted to let you know that Warren Simmons will be 
on vacation for two weeks beginning in early February.  He is planning to go 
to New York City so could make himself available for a meeting in Houston 
relatively easily.

I will forward Warren's academic information to you later today.  If you need 
any other information in the meantime, please do not hesitate to let me 
know.  Our contact details are below.

Best Regards,

Julia Deans

I guess it depends on where you got the prices - were they from a particular 
publication?  If not, I would suggest that you go to the NYMEX website and 
check for older prices there and you can cite to that.  Let me know if that 
doesn't work.

Rob Bradley@ENRON

Doug Leach said you were the expert.

I am publishing a chart using NYMEX settlement average prices by month in 
1998 and need to cite where the #s come from.  Doug said you would know.  Is 
there a data bank that has these prices or a hard copy that I can reference 
(publication, title, date, page).

Thank you very much,

ROB

Do we have a Netherlands ETA?
	
	

I am trying to follow up with Reliant concerning a desire to trade from their 
office in the Netherlands.  What is the status on an ETA for the Netherlands?

That's fine with me.

Mark Taylor has led Enrons' legal end on Enron Online. I want us to meet with 
him and benefit from his experience in the e-arena. He is available tomorrow 
at 11 am or 4 pm. Both these slots are available on my calendar.  Can you let 
me and Mark know if any of these times work for you ?

Thanks

Harry

David:

Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval 
process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading 
Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by 
non-Australian counterparties.  The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana 
be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and 
what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process 
going forward.  Any chance you might be available for a telephone 
conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?

Mark

Pets In the Office
 It's A Growing Trend

 In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some 
companies. Workers are bringing their
 pets to the office. 

 Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has 
been taking his golden retriever,
 Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early 
Show and talked with Co-Anchor
 Jane Clayson. 

 The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. "He brings a lot of 
emotion and people love it. He's
 very relaxed." 

 But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to 
the office if he wishes. Not
 everybody can bring their pet to work. 

 "A lot of it depends on the dog," says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not 
a rowdy dog. 

 "He just hangs out," explains Paucek. "He's easy to get along with." 

 Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, "My wife 
brings him in and drops him off at
 the office," Paucek says. 

 While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also 
many legal issues to consider. John
 Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend 
of bringing pets to the work
 place is really growing. 

 "More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their 
working place
 employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace," 
says Challenger 

 He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and 
employees need to explore before
 they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy. 

 "One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a 
policy like that, is take a poll
 of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain 
employees that don't feel
 comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy." 

 There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be 
liable if a dog or cat bites or
 scratches another employee. 

 "The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of 
policy in effect," says
 Challenger. "The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites 
someone or the cat scratches
 someone, it can't be the company's fault." 

 Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office. 

 "Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, 
will you put them in a
 certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? 
Many don't feel
 comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats 
and dogs and what
 about birds? What about the noise of birds?" 

 Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, "It gets 
chaotic." 

 In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. 
They found that: 

      21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 
      76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the 
job 
      33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals

 If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should: 

      poll employees before they let the pets come 
      provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome 
in the office 
      establish an off-limits-to-pets area 
      make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated 
      bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office 
      tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times

 If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should 
make a rotating schedule. 

 When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when 
he and Hoss arrive at work, "I get
 off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the 
employees. He has his own
 web page."

This looks good to me so I will go ahead and approve it unless you have an 
objection.
I have created the following new Product Type in the Data Manager:

US East Power Phy Firm ICAP

Please go into the DataManager and indicate your approval. If you have any 
questions concerning the Product Type, please DO NOT REJECT it, rather call 
me instead.

I have attached a full description of the Product that will be built under 
this Product Type for your review.

Here is the e-mail we received from ISDA.  Since we only have $500 left and 
they are suggesting $1000 for the lunch, I'm not sure it makes sense to send 
someone.  I've left a voice-mail for Stacey to ask where they stand and 
whether or not they still want us to send someone.

Hello Mark and Mark -- Any chance of Enron contributing to the Lugar event
on Monday, March 27th?  If so, are either of you available to come to D.C.
for the event?  I think it owuld be great to have you there particularly
since we still need to nail down treatment of energy products.

I have attached event details.  Thanks!

 - Lugar Fundraiser.doc

Hey guys!

Wow - 10 acres - sounds like a ranch!  I'm still working at Enron in Houston 
- it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary I work for does a lot of 
trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil.  I'm 
in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and 
issues.  I just got promoted a few days ago so I guess things are going well.

I had an e-mail from Paul Palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but 
haven't heard from him since.  Mark Kopinski & I stay in touch - he's in New 
York managing a couple of international mutual funds.  He & Debbie adopted a 
little girl (Celena) from China and seem very happy living in a high-rise in 
the middle of Manhattan.  I get up there on business a few times a year and 
try to stop in to say hi.

I was in Monmouth for our 20 year class "reunion" last June.  There were only 
2 of us there and I didn't even remember the other guy!  Oh well, maybe the 
25th will be a bigger draw.

C.F.&S.,
Mark

Stacy Carey called back to say that the $500 would appreciated as would a 
person to attend.  I didn't know if you had anyone who could go so I 
suggested that someone from your office call her on Monday morning to discuss 
details.  Stacy's number is (202)457-6545.

Cynthia:

Here is a first draft of an agenda for our meeting this afternoon.

Mark

Here is the revised Koch confirmation marked to show the changes.

I realized after I had sent the Koch confirmation to you (but before I faxed 
it to Koch) that I might have given too much away by using the Effective Date 
as the Buyer Payment Date.  In the version I send to Koch I will change that 
to Trade Date.  You can always change it to a later date if you want to 
tomorrow.

I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for 
bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last 
week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still 
in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC.

David Forster
03/27/2000 04:26 PM
Mark,

Attached is a copy of the OTC GTC which the Bandwidth group wishes to use for 
Bandwidth trading on EnronOnline, launching May 1.

Could you please let me know which of your guys will be looking after 
reviewing/amending this for EnronOnline?

Thanks,

Dave
David,

Here's a first cut of the data to get us started.  Please have a look, and 
let me know what other blanks we will need to fill in as we go.  I've also 
looked at the additional considerations, and we should sit down and discuss 
some of these things with Jean sometime soon.

Please review the attached documents, and I'll continue to refine them along 
the way.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help,
Jay

Reuters Legal NY has reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement for 
enrononline.com
that you submitted to me earlier this week and comments are noted below.

Over to you now, for your legal to review and make appropriate changes as I do
not have the Agreement in an electronic format.

Lynne

Lynne:

Here are my comments on the agreement:

1) Change references from Reuters Group plc to Reuters America Inc.

2) Delete last sentence of Section 3 or insert the words "at Protected Party's
expense" after the text "best efforts"

3) Insert the following at the end of the first sentence in Section 4:

,  and that is designated in writing as confidential, proprietary or marked 
with
words  of  like  import or, if orally conveyed, Protected Party provides 
written
notice  describing  in  reasonable  detail the portion of the oral 
communication
that  shall  be deemed Confidential Information and delivers such writing to 
you
within 10 days of the oral conveyance.

4) Insert the following at the end of the last sentence in Section 4:

or  (d)  is  developed  by  you independently of any Confidential Information 
it
receives from the Protected Party.

5) Insert the following right before the last sentence in Section 6

However, the Protected Party represents and warrants to you that it has the
right to make the disclosures permitted under this Agreement without violating
any applicable law or regulation or any legally enforceable agreement to which
it is a party.

6) In Section 9, replace "Money damages would" with "Money damages may".  
Change
both  references  of "Texas" to "New York".  Delete the five sentences 
regarding
arbitration.

Jay -

Thanks for your note.  This definitely falls into the "(b)" category.  The 
problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I 
can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.  

Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least 
risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if 
there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As 
for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For 
instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were 
unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up 
with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to 
look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available 
from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and 
that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very 
similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate 
regarding the services they provide to us?

Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be 
trying to do this the "right" way.

Mark

James Bruce   03/30/2000 02:33 AM

	

Dear Mark (back from South America?)

I received this email from Donna Greif.  It explains the sources for her data 
which she puts on EnronOnline every day.  As best I know, Mark, we don't have 
any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.

I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American 
governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from 
Telerate.

We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our 
reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site 
(their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think 
this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their 
data without a right to do so.  The same applies for Telerate--we don't even 
give them recognition--we just post their numbers on our site.

I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like 
lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that, 
but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really 
not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.

Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.  If I 
don't hear from you, I'll assume that you don't think it's an important issue.

Thanks

Jay

Jay,

In your original email (attached below), you requested my source of US Nat 
Gas Stats that are posted as a newsticker item on the website.   Please note, 
I would have been more than happy to provide you with source details on the 
Canadian Weather Forecasts and NGTL Pipeline Data if it was part of your 
original request.

US Natural Gas Statistics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)
 * My source is the Producer Newsletter distributed by the Mid-Marketing 
Department (Ross Prevatt & Dan Diamond
    are both part of that team).  For your convenience, I've attached a copy 
for your records
 * The Producer Newsletter is distributed on a weekly basis (Monday nights or 
Tuesday morning)
     and is faxed.  
        - the Mid-Marketing Department gets those numbers from several 
different sources.
        - I called Ross again today to re-verify.  He confirmed the following 
for me:
  * Gas Storage data comes from a direct feed from Telerate.
  * Lucy Oritz passes on the cumulative heating degree days to Ross.
       > Her source is National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration
       > web address = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/grr/wfolocat.htm
     - Should you require any additional details and need to make contact 
with Ross again.....
       I did take the liberty of explaining who you are, the group you 
represent as well as
       why you were needing this information.  I am sure he will be fully 
receptive and understand
       the nature of your question should you need to contact him again.  

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
 * Candace Spencer & Terri Brian in Enron Canada's office pull this 
information from two different sources.  
 * They pull this information together, and fax updates us each morning.
     - NGTL Pipeline Data is pulled from 
http://www.nrgexpressway.com/ngtl/index.htm
  * You must have a password to gain access to this information.
     - Canadian Weather Forecast data is pulled from 
http://weather.ec.gc.ca/alberta_e.shtml
  * Upon reaching the site, you would select the appropriate City.
  * Once in the city, scroll down to get the weather forecast data.

My apologies for any mis-communications on your original request.  Feel free 
to call me if you are in need of more 
details (x3-9517).

Thanks,

dg

P.S.  Currently, Noel Petterson is updating the website.  His back-up is Matt 
Motsinger.   In additions (just an FYI), this
will be my last week with the EnronOnline team.   Please forward any future 
requests to Frank Davis.

==========================================================================

James Bruce   03/29/2000 09:48 AM

Following our exchange of emails two weeks ago, I spoke with Ross (whom you 
suggested), but he didn't know of you & didn't think that anything he 
produced was sent to you.  He suggested that I contact Dan Diamond, who wrote 
back saying that he didn't know anything either but that I should contact 
Rahil Jafry.  The only problem of course is that I work with Rahil, and I'm 
trying to find this information in response to a discussion that I had with 
him!

So, could you tell me exactly where you get your information from, for the 
following items:

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
US Natural Gas Stastics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)

Even if you don't know the specific source, if you could tell me how you get 
the information, then I'll try to follow it up.  So, for example, 'Each day 
at 6am I receive a fax from 713.853.2297 with a list of numbers.  I take 
these numbers and put them in the Canadian ...'

Sorry to keep bothering you, but this is a potentially serious issue for 
us--we need to know exactly where we're getting our content from, and no one 
seems to know!  So anything that you can do to help would be appreciated 
greatly.

Thanks in advance

Jay

==========================================================================

	
	

The EnronOnline team gets those numbers from the weekly Newsletter 
distributed the ENA Commercial Team.   Ross Prevatt is the individual who
actually puts the information together.

In talking with Ross this morning, that information is taken from a Telerate 
feed  (the Telerate feeder gets the info from daily/weekly/monthly 
publications).  Ross did not give me the specific companies that publish the 
information.  Feel free to call Ross directly if you need additional 
information.

Thanks,

Dear Donna

(Following the voicemail that I left for you on Friday)  I was wondering if 
you could tell me whether or not the US Gas Storage data & the cumulative 
CDD/HDD data are taken from inside Enron only?  (I'm asking because Paul 
Goddard has encouraged me to update our letters of consent for content that 
we carry on the website.)

Many thanks,

Jay

Thanks for the messages - I have not heard anything since they left.  VERY 
good news!

Scott:

The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our 
counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and 
there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK 
courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should 
go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up 
in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.

Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.

Thanks,

Mark

My sense is that the market custom here is to use the English courts, not 
arbitration. I think the English commercial court judges are pretty 
sophisticated and would be able to work through the issues.

Since Paul is out this week, I haven't had a chance to speak to him about 
this. Let's wait to hear his views when he returns to the office. Thanks!

Richard:

In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration 
in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to 
judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the 
jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in 
civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts 
generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap 
agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK 
agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts 
(where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our 
policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I 
would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely 
enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

Thanks,

Mark

I'm not sure - I thought we were not adding any products -- just opening 
existing products to Japanese counterparties.  Is he talking about the 
existing GTC's for petroleum products?

the international rollout of petroleum products?

Alan,

Have you had a chance to review the EOL contracts that we will be using in 
Japan for the rollout of the international petroleum products?  If not we 
probably should take a look.  I would also like to have B&M review as well.  
Pls send me a copy when you have this available.  We are shooting to have 
products posted by the end of the month and an official rollout 10-12 May.

While EOL should be ready to go, there could be some complications with FX 
coming from Sydney, commodity prices from Singapore and even help desk 
support from London.

Let's talk about this early on this week.

thanks,

Joe

Are you planning to attend the planning committee meeting in Monmouth next

The schedule calls for the meetings to end at 5:00.  There's also a play (The 
Merry Wives of Windsor) that night and we can work around that if you were 
planning on going.

Thanks for forwarding all of this stuff - so far it has all been mine.  I 
think your name must come up automatically for some of these folks when they 
just type in Mark Taylor.  It's not nearly as bad as when there was another 
Mark E Taylor - and he wasn't nearly as nice about it either (instead of 
forwarding them to me, he would send them back to the senders with sometimes 
nasty notes like 'try to get it right next time').   Luckily for both you and 
me he is no longer with Enron -- can you imagine how bad it would be if there 
were three of us?  When I get these, I usually send a note back to the sender 
letting them know that there are two of us and they need to pay attention 
when addressing things to one or the other.

I think the below solves our issue.  Dennis was not planning to give trading 
advice under the Management S...Agr....Thanks very much for your assistance.  
	Enron Energy Services
	

I have revised schedule 1 to include one more service such that EES has the 
option to serve Quantum electric index based purchase requirements at their 
otherwise applicable price.  This added service combined with the forward 
hedge provisions allowed for in the Stock Purchase Agreement will eliminate 
the need for the "Risk Management Consulting Services" outlined in the 
Management Services Agreement.  Please delete references to Risk Management 
Services in this agreement.

Thank You
Dennis
	Enron Energy Services
	

  Comment on Shedule 1 Scheduling Services is attached.  

Additionally, we will may need a Services Agreement where Mercury provides 
some of these services "scheduling or settlements" post-closing.  Can we 
incorporate the concept of them providing services to us within the same 
agreement.

Dennis

Dennis-
We had incorporated PG&EES's comments to the last draft we sent out last week 
some time and had left those comments in brackets as we did not have EES's 
input.  Some of those changes were accepted by Jeff and some were not.  
Deborah Culver also had some issues with a few of their changes, which we 
need to finalize during this upcoming call.   I believe you should have 
received these via prior e-mail from Mary Moreland of your firm, but for your 
reference, attached is the latest version of the agreement and of Schedule 1.

Jeff indicated that he would let me know when he was available for a call, 
but I have not heard back from him.  I'll keep you posted.  Sheryl.

>>> <Dennis.Benevides@enron.com> 04/04/00 11:47AM >>>

I am available after 3 pm today or any time tomorrow.

PG&E ES had indicated that they made quite a few changes to the MSA.  Are
these incorporated in the latest draft?

Dennis

At Jim Keller's request, I would like to try and schedule a call to
"finalize" the legal and business points on the Management Agreement before
we send it on to PG&E.   Please let me know what time would be convenient
for the group either this afternoon or tomorrow.  Sheryl.

"Good meal" in Monmouth?  Not sure if that is really possible by your

You might want to take a read through this one more time just to make sure I

We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.  In the 
past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal 
Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms 
who might be willing to move.  Please give this a little thought and if you 
know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact 
them.

Thanks for you help.

dinner.  If we're not interested he can go on Sunday but if we want to go 
he'll get us tickets.  I can go either way - what do you think?

Thanks for your note - I'll keep those items in mind.  It seems pretty clear 
to me that the Pres. has something of a bricks and mortar agenda and some 
gentle nudges towards a more academic path may be needed.   I asked Mark 
Kopinski, who is also coming to the planning meeting, if he wanted to join us 
for dinner so I've sent him a note asking if he wants to go to the play or 
not - I'll let you know what he says - I have mixed feelings since I'd like 
to see the play but would regret the time we could have spent chatting.

Alan:

Regarding the legal comments below:

My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue:  i.e. the 
umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) 
will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice 
of law provision.  These agreements have been approved by local counsel in 
Japan.  This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides 
that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.  As is the case for 
all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities 
contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for 
UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the 
counterparty is situated.  When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume 
that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that 
bridge is still ahead of us.

I don't know what the "international contracts" are that Rousseau refers to.  
There is no standard agreement for online trading.  The ETA provides that if 
a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place 
(such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what 
Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions.  
The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the 
time the master was signed.

In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, 
the legal side of things is ready to go.

Rousseau Anai
04/03/2000 04:43 PM
Hi John

I was wondering whether you could clarify the following additional issues:

* Legal
I'm not comfortable that the legal/contract situation is being sorted out. 
Mario mentioned that there is still some debate as to whether the contracts 
should be under Japanese or US law etc... This was something that they were 
debating about 3 weeks ago.

My understanding was that international contracts would be used. These are 
contracts that trading houses and investment banks would already be familiar 
with. Could you clarify the exact nature of the hold-up and get a date by 
which they will finalise this issue. The name of the legal guy is Mark 
Taylor. I'd like to contact him directly some time to make sure everything is 
progressing as planned (after all, if we don't have the contracts ready, 
noone can trade)

* Help desk
It is not a good idea to totally rely on the Houston help desk for EOL 
(especially during Japanese business hours). It took them about 4 minutes to 
get a translator. Using the translator was time consuming (also remember, 
international call), the translator was quite rude....and, in any case, I 
agree that there should be some support on the ground (demonstrate Enron 
commitment to Japan)

Please feel free to give me a call. I'm at the Okura on +81 3 3582 0111

Joe,

After extensive probing I discovered that the marketing materials EOL has 
planned cannot be delivered in time for our plans.  I can think of a number 
of alternatives for addressing this problem, including: changing brochures to 
one that can be more easily produced, changing printing firms and/or 
locations, and delaying the launch date until the following week.  

At least one person at EOL suggested that we have a "press conference" on May 
10 and then send out the materials.  I do not think this is an acceptable 
approach because it wastes the opportunities from the Nikkei interview on 
April 10, the higher profile McDonald/Hirl interviews during last week of 
April and buzz from counterparties receiving the packet.

There appears to be a pervasive misunderstanding of our strategy and 
timelines.  To correct this, I have asked for a meeting with all of the 
interested parties (except Louise) on Monday afternoon.  We WILL walk through 
every step of the marketing plan and ensure that we have buy-in and 
accountable parties for the parts of the process that are outside of the 
control of Enron Japan.  After the meeting, I will let you know where we 
stand and what we can reasonably expect.  If we cannot resolve everything, 
I'll confer with you before taking it up with Louise.

John

PS Please note the following exchange.  Please let me know if you want for me 
to soften my position.

	Enron International
	

Dave,

I understand that the meeting has been set for 2:00 p.m. on Monday in your 
office.  I look forward to our getting together to nail down the details 
while there is still an opportunity to make necessary adjustments. 

On the subject of cover letters, there are several reasons for our approach:
Given the urgency of completing the necessary pieces of the  mailing, it is 
more expedient to include two letters than to go through approvals on a new 
joint letter.
We want our counterparties to understand that there are two avenues of 
communication into Enron - EnronOnline (initially in English) for its 
e-commerce platform and Enron Japan for a host of Japan specific business 
lines.  It is important that we position them as separate but complementary.  
It's very easy for people in this market to confuse multifaceted business 
interests.  To be effective, we need to direct them to the appropriate 
sources/authorities.
At this point EnronOnline will only be available in English, so potential 
users would need to be able to read your letter in English anyway.  
However, in following Japanese protocols, many of the packets will need to be 
sent to higher level officials, who would then pass the packet on to the end 
users.  These are the people that we need to notify of Enron's Tokyo office 
and that EnronOnline is one of the many products and services available 
through Enron.  It is essential that this higher audience have the name of 
just the top Enron official in Japan, otherwise they may think that they 
should bypass the Enron Japan office and always go to Houston.  (In this 
culture it is a real risk.)  This would  jeopardize Enron's strategy for 
Japan.

I hope the above mentioned considerations are helpful.  I look forward to 
discussing this further when we meet Monday.

John 

  

David Forster@ECT
03/31/2000 07:11 PM
John,

It seems strange to me that we will not be translating the cover letter. This 
would mean that the cover letter is the only thing in the envelope which is 
not in Japanese?

Also, I'm wondering why we would have two cover letters. Would it not be 
better to combine the messages into one?

Perhaps we can discuss on Monday - I understand a conference call with the 
recipients of this email is being set up.

Dave

Mario,
We sent the translation to Kal yesterday afternoon, Japan time.  The cover 
letter is fine with us (we don't plan to translate it, since users can read 
English).  We plan to add another cover letter in Japanese from Hirl as 
well.  If, in addition to Kal, you need the translation too, please let me 
know.  I'll be back in the US next week if we need to discuss (I'll be 
calling Kal to ask about printing delivery dates).
Thanks,
John

Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON
03/31/2000 03:32 PM
John,

We were checking today the launch process for EOL in Japan. Could you please 
let us know the status of the Press Release and the translation of the 
"Getting Started", the ball brochure and the cover letter? Is there an 
expected date for the completion of the translation?

Thanks in advance,

Mario

Rousseau:

I have copied you on an e-mail to Alan Aronowitz which may answer your 
questions.  If not, please feel free to call and we can discuss your issues.  
If I am not at hand when you call, my assistant can book a particular time on 
my calendar so we won't be trading calls forever.

Mark

Mark K thought the play sounded like a good idea so if you could get tickets 
for us that would be great.  My flight out isn't until around 11:00 Friday 
morning so I can always stay up late to chat!  I'll be there Thursday 
morning, too - I'm supposed to attend a lecture at 11 but am free before that 
- any Chemistry classes or labs I should sit in on?

Mark

Any further news from Russia?  There's a good chance I'll have to go to DC 
for a day tomorrow & if they're back I might be able to get up there to see 
them - I could try and get an early enough flight tomorrow afternoon that I 
could spend the evening with them.

What do you think?  OK with me, although I think I'm supposed to leave for 
South America on Sunday evening (gone 5 days or so - this is the trip that 
has been postponed twice already so I won't be surprised if it is delayed 
again).
G & I were discussing having a Sunday afternoon cocktail party next Sunday
(Palm Sunday, April 16).  Considering it is kind of last minute, and it is
Palm Sunday weekend, we wanted to take a quick poll:

Question:
If we planned a gathering between 2pm-5pm on Sunday would you be able to
attend.

Thanks for your help.

MRC

Nobody is leaving - it's a new position.

Allison -  I don't think they were expecting Cynthia to attend these meetings 
with me - there will only be one representative from each of the three 
companies.  I did want her to know what meetings had been set up for me 
though and to know I was in town that day in case she wanted me to see anyone 
else.  My flight out isn't until after 7:00 pm. and I assume that the Luken 
meeting will be over around 3:00.

Mark - Cynthia is out of town today, but I let her know that you are coming 
to town and she is more than happy to attend these meetings with you.  She 
will be at 1301 Longworth for the Weston meeting at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday.  
Would you mind letting me know who else will be attending the meetings so I

Just a heads up - Mark H. asked me to set up a day that he and I could come 
to your office to discuss the legal issues surrounding electronic 
confirmations of transactions generally but in particular those done over 
EnronOnline.  I'll check with his assistant and get a couple of potential 
dates.

Hey Marc! - We're in town this weekend - let us know if you plan something.

G & I were discussing having a Sunday afternoon cocktail party next Sunday
(Palm Sunday, April 16).  Considering it is kind of last minute, and it is
Palm Sunday weekend, we wanted to take a quick poll:

Question:
If we planned a gathering between 2pm-5pm on Sunday would you be able to
attend.

Thanks for your help.

MRC

Mario -

We have conducted our initial legal due diligence for the EnronOnline launch 
in Japan.  The advice we have received is that to the extent the agreements 
are enforceable under the law chosen (e.g. New York for the PA and ETA) they 
should be enforceable in Japan as well.  Local counsel is aware of our 
business and has not identified any other legal pitfalls.  We have not looked 
into the registration of domain names in Japan.  Please let me know if this 
is required.

Mark

Mario Parra Cardoso@ENRON
03/31/2000 02:24 PM
Mark,

We identified some matters (listed below) related to EnronOnline launch in 
Japan. Please advise.

Are there issues to be addressed on:
  - the compliance with local corporate requirements to trade the products 
currently available in EOL?
  - the determination of issues surrounding electronic trading 
(enforceability)?
  - unanticipated regulatory impacts (both local and international trading)?
  - the registration of internet domain names in the local jurisdiction?
  - the compliance with local documentation requirements?
  - the compliance with local Trade Practices Act?

Thanks in advance,

Mario Parra Cardoso

Thanks for your note - I am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the 
airport in Minneapolis.  I was in DC on Wednesday (too bad Tim & Sharon 
aren't back) and then flew on to Monmouth (well, flew most of the way - the 
closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away) for a capital 
campaign planning committee meeting.  Mark Kopinski was there and he and I 
had dinner with Dr. Kieft (our fraternity advisor and one of my chem. 
professors) who is still teaching.  I'm now on my way back to Houston - 
flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late.  Hope you are well.

Love,

Mark

Are you sure about this?  I didn't know I had a NY bar number.

York in order to obtain CLE credits on your behalf for attending the Enron 
Law Conference.  (Tami, there are two names on the second page of the New 
York sign-up sheet that I could not read-maybe you could send this message on 
to those two people if you can read the names).  Thanks.  Brenda McAfee

Robbi:

The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late 
February, a copy of which is attached.  No proposed regulations have resulted 
but could come out at any time now.  There is also some activity on the Hill 
(bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House 
Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.  We have been 
monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you.  
Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.

the CFTC?

Alan
Alan,

  I understand that there are new CFTC regulations scheduled for release that 
may impact our trading world. Do you have any info about these proposed 
changes?  

Please respond to xtrials@optioninvestor.com

Trading Alert 3:PM

We are concerned about the Asian markets tonight and how they
will react to Brazil. We feel you should consider closing open
positions before the end of the day in case Asia self destructs tonight.

The U.S. markets have recovered strongly but are still showing signs
of further weakness. Time to be careful until a new market trend is
established.

Good Luck

Jim

I don't think this one will work for us - we would prefer a college degree.

If not, could you please send us the appropriate contracts?

How are things going?
I just wanted to make 2 requests:

* Could I have your notes re: legal FAQ ASAP
*  I have a copy of the PA from the EOL site. If there were any revisions 
made to it in order to customize for the Japanese launch, could you please 
send me an electronic copy

Thanks

The PA and ETA for Japanese counterparties will be identical to those for 
North America unless they need revision for some commercial reason.  I will 
try and get to the FAQ's tomorrow.

Gentlemen,

We have put together a template to help with the conceptualization of 
eBusiness opportunities for the Enron Net Works Group.
This is a broad attempt to put some structure around the multitude of issues 
that must be addressed to validate and correctly 
conceive these ventures (in addition to reducing redundancy).

In regards to the legal analysis that must be conducted, I have attached the 
relevant excerpt below.  Essentially, the list is to help 
internal sponsors and managers understand the issues at hand prior to and 
during the formation of these businesses, and 
be able to talk to legal experts such as yourselves about the business' role 
in the context of material legal issues.  I would 
appreciate your comments--any and all are welcome.  

Potentially, triggers or thresholds for "classification" may be relevant, but 
I defer to your judgement those issues that may be of 
relevance to the non-legal businessperson.  I look forward to your responses.

Regards,
Darren Maloney

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are planning to roll out Windows 2000 in early May.  This 
will require upgrading our computer equipment with what is "necessary" to run 
Windows 2000, including new CPUs for most of us.  Although I haven't seen 
Windows 2000 yet, I am told that there are very few changes, the most 
significant one being that we will be using Lotus Notes for calendar 
purposes.  (Organizer goes away.)  We are told that with 1 hour of training 
everyone should be up to speed!

Could you please take a moment to answer the following questions? 

Do you or your assignments have a Palm Pilot? NO

Do you or your assignments have an "Enron" purchased computer at home? NO

Do you or your assignments have any personal software you have loaded? YES

Do you or your assignments save any files to your C: drive? YES

Do you or your assignments save any files to your H: drive? YES

I need this information as quickly as possible.  Also, please let me know if 
you are planning any vaction time during the month of May so we can start 
scheduling training.

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!

The Nightmare on Wall Street, Starring China, Brazil, Argentina and
others.

I woke up with a terrible nightmare this morning. I dreamed that
the S&P Futures were limit down -27 and the Dow futures were down
-300. The bad news - it was not a nightmare, it was real life.

If you don't live in a closet you know by now that the Brazil
counterpart to Alan Greenspan resigned and Brazil devalued its
currency. The worst possible of all global scenarios. But wait!
Is that another dip to buy?

After opening down -266 on the Dow and -113 on the Nasdaq, the worst
was over before it started. The CNBC hype undoubtedly contributed
to the massive sell off because as soon as buyers could get into
the market we moved immediately off the panic lows.

I am not saying this is not a problem but as I said last night I
thought Brazil had already been discounted in the market. The
rapid bounce back has proven this to some extent. Several analysts
said several months ago that we could expect -500 to -600 if Brazil
devalued. Since it did not happen it shows the strength of the
current bull market.

I went on record last night that I did not think we were starting
a correction and the bull was just resting. Was I worried this
morning? You bet! But I was also greatly relieved when I saw the
buyers come back to work. Think about it. What else can happen
that could be worse than this? Nothing I can imagine. Sure the
Asian connection to Brazil will be tested tonight and we are still
faced with the domino theory in South America, but again, I think
the worst is already discounted. As soon as investors realize that
Latin America did not sink beneath the ocean and the IMF is not
going to let the eighth largest economy in the world sink, then
they will be putting that cash back to work.

The volume this morning was not bad. The volume on the recovery
this afternoon was great. The Nasdaq did almost 1.2 billion shares
again and the NYSE over 900 mil. The market is expecting earnings
by the dozens next week and appears ready to rumble.

Intel broke with the pack early and starred in the recovery adding
+3.44 for the day. Microsoft, SunMicro and almost anything tech
shook off the news and powered forward. SunMicro was up over $10
at one point on takeover rumors by IBM. IBM announced they were
raising over $4 bil in new cash today which was earmarked in part
for acquisitions. Microsoft and Dell were up strongly at midday
but caved in at the close.

Traders fear of darkness was apparent as the Dow backslid from
-35 to -125 and the Nasdaq turned slightly negative at the close.
The fear of course comes from going to bed with profits and
waking up the next day to surprises from Asia like we had from
Brazil this morning. Tonight will tell the tale. If Asia does
not melt and the politicians in Brazil work their magic and say
the words analysts want to hear then it is off to the races again.

At the risk of repeating myself too much, there just seems to be
nothing that can derail this market. I took a bloodbath this morning
but when I saw it was not going to get worse I jumped back in and
got some bargains at really good prices. As evidenced by the quick
bounce there were other blue light shoppers there as well.

The VIX settled at 31 after being as high as 35.48 and appears
to confirm the worst to be over.

Apple Computer easily beat the street estimates tody after the
close and more strong earnings are due out soon from MSFT, IBM,
SUNW, SLR, etc. All are expected to do well. No skeletons in the
U.S. economy so look for continued movement upward barring any
sympathy crashes overseas tonight.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

We generally do not give legal advice to our counterparties - regarding tax 
or other legal consequences to their trading.  The only thing we could safely 
say would be something to the effect of "If you are concerned about the tax 
consequences of your EnronOnline transactions, please consult your tax 
advisor."

In your FAQ, you might like to outline the contract structure in some detail, 
for eg:

Was there any particular reason that you chose the PA to be with ENA rather 
than Enron Japan.  Note, Australia was done for the Australian market.

I would prefer to change it to Enron Japan. Will we have to receive further 
external advice? If not, I will change it accordingly.

Regards 
Rousseau

Here are my FAQ comments - all of the existing answers are still correct.

Nedre:

We have interviewed four candidates so far and may be able to decide on one 
of them - the group will be meeting early next week to discuss everyone's 
reactions to the interviews.  If you have other resumes we would be happy to 
look at them - my own view is that while these candidates would be OK, they 
are not superstars (like the person we are losing).

Mark

   
	
	

Mark,

I was wondering how close you and your group are to making a decision
on the Paralegal position.   I know you have seen some candidates.  Would you 
like
to continue to see more or do you want to choose from the pool that you have 
already seen?

I haven't heard much feedback (evaluation sheets or email) from the 
interviewing group, and 
I need to know what you all think of the candidates.  Please let me know 
where we are at your 
earliest convenience.

Thanks,
Nedre Strambler

My only remaining comment would be a request that the we have a week to 
provide the notice we are required to give if we are unable to obtain the 
exchange consents - that would mean changing the date to September 7, 2000  
at the end of the sentence.

Otherwise it all looks good to me.   I will forward everything on to Mark 
Holsworth for his final review - particularly with respect to the affiliates 
issue.

Thanks very much for your help in getting this done.

Enron/Reuters Working Group:

Attached are revised Order Forms and a revised Terms & Conditions.  Please 
note
the following changes:

References to "Enron Corporation" have been changed to "Enron Corp."

A termination right for the data portion of the transaction has been inserted 
in
the Order Form for data.

References to "Distributor's Subsidiaries" have been added in the license 
grant
in Section 4.1 of the T&C as well as in the indemnification section in Section
14 to extend the indemnification protection by Reuters to Distributor's
Subsidiaries.  Because of the wider scope of the license, a Section 16.10 has
been added to make clear that if any of Distributor's Subdiairies breach the
Agreement, Reuters will look to Enron Corp. rather than the individual
subsidiary.  The reason for this is that although Reuters acknowledges that
Enron's subsidiaries may be involved in operating the URLs, Reuters does not
want to be put in a situation in which it has to search for the relevant
subsidiary to remedy the breach.

Mark:
I hope the added language addresses your concern regarding the protection of
Enron's Affiliates and the ability of Affiliates to participate in the 
operation
of URLs.  Please call to discuss if necessary (646-298-9571).

Mark:

Here is the most recent draft of the Reuters document.  You will see that 
while they didn't give us everything we asked for, they made significant 
progress on the indemnity.  I'm not sure they have satisfied your concern 
regarding the Enron affiliates issues - they have added in subsidiaries in 
several places but refused to change the definition of "Distributor" to 
include affiliates.

If you need a complete set of all of the drafts we have been through (to see 
all of the marked changes) let me or Dave Samuels know and we can forward 
them to you (I think there were at least 4 versions since the draft we 
discussed with them the other day).

Since I will be in Brazil on Monday, it might make sense for you to 
coordinate your reactions with Dave.  If you need me, please leave a 
voice-mail or ask  my assistant (Taffy x57373) to track me down.

Hi Dave:

Thanks for your note!  It's hard to believe that Washington House was over 
twenty years ago now.  I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law 
school in Michigan.  My first job after graduating was for a law firm in 
Houston.  They opened a New York office in the mid 80's and I went there to 
help out.  The office wasn't successful but I loved living in New York so I 
moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total.  One of 
those years was spent working in Asia - primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong.  
I've now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron - a large 
energy company - and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues.  
We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit 
periodically.  I'm actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I'm helping 
them get some products ready to trade online.  I get back to Washington a 
couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually 
have been there when you were in town - I think I was there the 11th & 12th.

I've stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M.C. 
from time to time.  Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of 
international mutual funds for American Century.  I was on the Alumni Board 
for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see 
the people who came back - unfortunately I haven't really stayed in touch 
very well.  There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time 
so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while - of course 
Woodbine is gone, there's a new theater, a big addition to the gym and 
several major interior renovations.  And I understand there are big plans for 
more - they are going to close Sixth Street, tear down Gibson and expand the 
campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm, a big expansion to the 
sports facilities (indoor track, pool, etc.) and a redesign of the library.  
Enrollment is up above 1000.

Congratulations on your successful career - who would have thought when we 
got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well!  
There are doctors, bankers, chemists and lawyers everywhere you look.  I 
guess we really did learn something while we were there.

Let me know if you ever get to Texas.  It would be fun to get together and 
catch up.

In case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat:

The ship's phone number is 323-208-910 or 920.  The fax is 323-208-924 or 911.
These numbers must be preceded by the correct "Ocean Code."
From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code).
From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code).
I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.

It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.

Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.

Thanks Sami.  It might be a good idea to try and get the ISDA team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities.  It's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products.  Just so you know, we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants (who are mostly banks and investment firms) before but the New York ISDA staff is usually willing to help us out.

FYI
 
Lavinia.Junqueira@itau.com.br on 09/28/2001 01:54:00 PM
Dear Sirs,

With regard to ISDA visit to Brazil and as discussed in our conference call
today, we would like to summarize the issues that we believe might be
important to raise with the Brazilian authorities as well as market
participants. We added some additional points as we realized might be
interesting to discuss:

I. ISDA Master Agreement and International Market Practice x Local Masters
and Brazilian Market Practices

a) Differences as to events of default, early termination, suspension of
contracts or valuations, etc. due to differences in market practices -
discussion of contrasts;

b) Definitions of events of default and early termination and reflex in
other local primary market agreements (loans, derivatives) - preparation
for trigger events of credit derivatives.

c) Should the master agreement be recognized by the authorities as an
official way to negotiate derivatives (ie. By creating a special regulatory
treatment, etc.) or should it be used voluntarily by market participants as
currently assumed?

II. ISDA Definitions of local rates, indexes, commodities, securities:
liquidity of local and international derivatives market referenced to
Brazilian financial instruments.

a) Contribution of ISDA to the negotiation of derivatives referenced to
Brazilian instruments.
b) Contribution of the authorities (ie. expansion of the scope to the
negotiation of international hedging derivatives by Brazilian banks and
counterparties).

III. Netting and Banking Credit Bills (c?dulas de cr?dito banc?rio).

a)   Instability of Provisional Measure x Contractual Reliability
     -    power of law x  weakness of legislative trust
     -    stability of contractual relations x change in law

b)   Negotiations of legislative approvals

c)            Independence of the Brazilian Central Bank and Monetary
Council

Parallel in other legislation x benefits to the market x constraints to the
market

IV. OTC Derivatives x Clearings

a)   Should all OTC Derivatives be registered in local clearances as the
authorities require ?

     -    pros and cos

b)   Tax effects and gambling characterization of unregistered contracts ?

V. Discussion of tax deviations that affect the derivatives industry.

a) Financial institutions: non-hedging transactions

b) Non-financial companies: hedging transactions

Feel free to contact us if you need any further explanations !

Joel:

Thanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?

Mark

Dear Mark:

No appointment is needed but Trade Day (Thursday) is usually best/least busy day to come
aboard.  Shall I send you some tickets for that day?  If you would like them please send
me your mailing address.

I understand that you will have an Amel at the Ft. Lauderdale boat show
next month.  Do I need an appointment to see the boat?

Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.

Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.  If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.  Mary and Anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.  As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.

David,

Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  

We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.

I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.

I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.

Mark

Mark,

First off, I hope that your family and friends are all well.  I feel very
lucky in that my family, friends and colleagues are all okay.  I kept
thinking about you and wasn't sure if you were stuck on the ship at the
time.  What happened - how did you get back?

On a more mundane, although important, note I thought I would update you on
some recent events.

We had a great meeting a few weeks back with Anne Koehler, Brad Richter and
Rex Shelby.  We helped them consider the various legal and practical issues
that would face Enron should you chose to host internet sites for customers
(as opposed to licensing the software to a company and letting them host
their own sites).  As it turns out, the business team decided to do some
more analysis before proceeding.

Pam Kavieff has asked us for help with eProjects (online auction sites for
construction projects) and we have provided documents to her team.

Barbara Gray has also asked for help on a project involving AEP.  I think
she wanted to clear this with you.

In that regard, I just confirmed with my assistant that I did not receive a
signed fee letter back from Frank Sayer ( I had sent one to him after we
meet with him several months ago).  We can either try to find that letter
and see if Frank signed it (or have him sign it) or I can send a new letter
to your attention.  In fairness to you, there may be a few things you need
to review (e.g., fax, copying charges come to mind).

Best regards,

David

Thanks!

Do you have time to work on this?

Mark:

	Craig Taylor on the East Desk forwarded this to me.  In looking at the material, it is clearly a financial deal.  I would ask that you assign this to someone in your group and have that person get in touch with Craig.

Craig,
 
As we  discussed on Thursday, LG&E is preparing to enter into a hedge plan.
 
LG&E's hedge  plan is based on the use of call options.  The Public Service  Commission is expected to act on that proposal in the next few  days.
 
Chris Balmer, Pam  Jaynes, and I will be giving you a call on Tuesday to discuss LG&E's  hedging plan, seek your comments, and address any issues or concerns you  may have in advance of actually sending out the bid letters.  We believe it  will be useful to seek your input and answer any questions you may have at  this point, since once regulatory approval is received the time to implement the  program, seek bids, and consummate transactions will all have very short turn  around times.
 
Attached are two  documents which will be the basis of that discussion.  The first is a draft  Bid Letter and the second is the General Terms and Conditions under which the  call options will be purchased.
 
Please review the  attachment and pass them along to whomever may need to be involved at your  company.
 
Thanks
 
Clay

Mark,

Further to my voicemail.  The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has asked to have the old lines from NatWest novated to RBS.  The 2 banks merged approx. 2 years ago.

RBS will send the originals to the appropriate person within Enron.

Would you please advise as to who, in your view, would be the appropriate person to handle this novation.

Many thanks in advance,
Suzanne Ferlic
011 44 207 783 4249

See below for RBS detail:

Line Limits are:
 
NW FX & DSL, US$13m, 2 yrs, no security
 
NW CRRM, US$97m, 15 yrs, has gtee from Enron Corp
 
Please let me know where and to whom we can send the original documents
to.
Thanks,
Jamie 
Hi Suzanne,
 
Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the actions
required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
documents which need to be executed are :-
 
1.  Novation Agreement

*	You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance in
NY soon
*	This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*	To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex 

*	Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom and
return via fax
*	As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need to
novate the collateral as well.

3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp

*	To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS

4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement

*	See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement letter.
*	This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names have to
be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
distributed to your payments division.
*	Please sign and return by fax

Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter. 
 
One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all documents to
be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a realistic
date for return.  Apologies for the rush.
 
 
Thanks and regards,

WELCOME!

Could you loan me your EnronOnline ID and Password again?  I'm trying to get some info out of it for the VE lawyers.

Travis C. McCullough 
 

Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.

Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:

1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow?
2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power?
3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements?
5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing change?

Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft. Lauderdale!

Mark

Dear Mark:

Thank you for your email.

Sara,
	I was just following up on what the status of our review of the "Three-way" agreement and referral agreement contracts that we are pursuing with Plains Resources, in order to facilitate small producer hedging.  If you could give me a call or reply with where we stand, I would appreciate it.  Thanks

Mark

Mark D. Smith
Manager

Sara:

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

Sorry for rambling.

Mark

Mark:  Can you please reply to (1) below?
Also, any ideas for help with brokerage agreements?
Thanks.  Sara

Mark:  Please read the attached message.

(1)  Are there any issues with following the "custom" in countries not requiring an executed "executing brokerage agreement"?  Do we need to contact outside counsel in each country?

(2)  I anticipate that I will really need help on the brokerage agreement side.  I cannot keep up now on a "timely" basis.

Gary's world occupies about 50% of my time.
Enron Corp. occupies about 25% of my time.

Thanks.  Sara

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

FYI  Looks like we may get free passes to the boat show!

Frank Sayre will be working on this matter while Cheryl is on vacation.

Darren, I am on vacation so to resolve the last outstanding issues, Mark Taylor will reassign this file since it is very active and but for the need to make the last changes to the guaranty, I believe that we are otherwise ready to move forward.   I will not be reachable tomorrow -- traveling all day so can you touch bases with the counterparty to let her know that I am on vacation but someone else will move the file forward?  I will call in Friday to see if any one has any questions. 

Please make sure that other commodities are included, such as Emissions.  As well, other PPL entities.  I believe the form originally sent to me earlier today covered this.  thks

Ed Sacks

Here is the final scoop on the PPL guaranties. Please call if you have any questions.

      Agreed. Please orchestrate consolidation of Enron Corp Guaranty
$'s for the following.

      At present PPL EnergyPlus holds the following enhancements.

      for EMPI    $30.0MM dated 4/23/99 and amended to $30.00 effective
3/13/01

      for E NA    $7.0M dated 8/1/99 and amended 8/1/99 which expired on
7/31/2001  ( kind reminder to extend)

      for E NA for financial transactions linked to  an ISDA (I believe)
date 3/21/2001 $15.0MM

      any questions please call     

Al,
I think that Enron and PPL should replace all previous guaranties with
$30MM documents covering the ISDA, Master Power Agreement and any
additional physical gas business as well. Please let me know if the
dollar amount is agreeable.

-Darren

I also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.  I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.  I thought we had until next year sometime.  My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.  

Scary, hunh?

Mark

Mark:

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all "legally approved" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.

I thought you would find this interesting:

http://austin.bcentral.com/austin/stories/2001/05/07/daily30.html

I spoke with Jamie this morning and explained our concerns (which master to use, given the merger is there a legal need for novation, since these are NY law documents would assignment be more appropriate, what collateral is involved to be transferred) and have since received a message from their lawyer in New York.  If they insist on a novation (which is not a commonly used concept in US law), you could certainly help by letting us know if there is anything to which you would object in their draft. I'll let you know if it gets to that.  Otherwise I think we're under control.

Mark

Hi Mark,

Sorry that this is proving to be tougher than we thought to connect.

Jamie Wood at RBS asks below if all looks okay to you in terms of the Novations?

Is there anything I can do to help?

Many thanks,
Suzanne

Suzanne,

I'm afraid I keep missing Mark Taylor.  Do you mind following up with him to
see how he's getting on and whether there is any problems with the
documents?

I will keep trying but would appreciate your help.

Thanks and regards,
Jamie

Hi Jamie,

Were you able to reach Mark Taylor in Houston re:  Enron's novation?

Please advsise,

Thanks,
Suzanne

Hi Suzanne,
Do you have all the information you need?
Where can we forward the original documents to?  

Cheers, Jamie

Hi Jamie,

You may need to translate the below for me (i.e. what is DSL and CRRM)?
Thanks,
Suzanne

Suzanne,

Limits are:

NW FX & DSL, US$13m, 2 yrs, no security

NW CRRM, US$97m, 15 yrs, has gtee from Enron Corp

Please let me know where and to whom we can send the original documents
to.
Thanks,
Jamie

Hi Jamie,

Thanks for this.  I think it may have to be sent to North America.
However, we would like to see a list of the lines that we would be
novating.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Hi Suzanne,

Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the
actions
required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
documents which need to be executed are :-

1.  Novation Agreement

*       You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance
in
NY soon
*       This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW
books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*       To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex

*       Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom
and
return via fax
*       As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need
to
novate the collateral as well.

3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp

*       To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS

4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement

*       See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement
letter.
*       This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names
have to
be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
distributed to your payments division.
*       Please sign and return by fax

Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter.

One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all
documents to
be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a
realistic
date for return.  Apologies for the rush.

Thanks and regards,

Mark,
We are currently getting prepared to trade ammonia and urea in Enron Global Markets.  We started the group within EGM - NGL's late July, and with the help of John Viverito, getting ourselves ready for the physical trade.  We would like to meet with you for a few minutes early next week, if possible, to discuss the financial contract, what we will need to get one prepared, etc.  Our goal is to be prepared to do both the physical and financial trading of fertilizer by the end of the year.

I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)

Mark:

	I am forwarding this to you for your delegation or response since it is a financial swap.

Thanks,

Jeff

Standard ISDA's are you comfortable with us proceeding?

Since they are already trading physical stuff online, they are probably already approved to trade financials as well and the master will just mean they don't have to accept the GTC's to trade the derivatives.  Tana can check quickly and see what they are approved for.

Mark - Louis Dreyfus Energy Services LP is signing their ISDA Master Agreement today and would like to get online to trade with EOL asap.  According to Jennifer McQuatde, they are currently trading physicals online and, she believes, have signed all the necessary docs.  Louis Dreyfus has asked if we would turn them on to trade OTC derivatives online based upon a fax of the signature page to their ISDA.  What is your view on this, oh mighty one?  Frank

Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?  There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.   I assume we are only showing one side of this market.

Sounds like a great idea - how quickly can you get it out there?

Brad,

We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).

I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.

A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.  

It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?

Steve

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Louise

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

Brad

I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

GP

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron. 

Can you help Bryant with this?  Mary and Sara are both out tomorrow, Brent is supposed to get the form for the Commodity Logic matters finished and Francisco can't really take anything new until Monday.  I don't think Anne and Barbara have enough ISDA experience to look at somebody else's paper quickly.  If you are swamped, maybe you can get this started (I doubt if they even have credit approval yet) and somebody else can take it over next week.

I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.

I have forwarded these on to Chris Long (who will get back to me on Monday) and left a message for Ken to let him know I will send it on to him as soon as Chris signs off.

Mark,  with these and my comments ( which I did not forward to Ken, have you?) we should be done. 
Jim --

Sorry this took so long.  Here are my changes.  I don't think that I did any major damage, just didn't want Enron to say that all volatility was and is the result of deregulation.

Thanks,

Both of you are listed in Lotus Notes on this one.  Not sure who has had most recent contact.  I someone working on a no-confirms agreement for Chase already?

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane

It appears this was handled by the Calgary office.  Greg Johnston will give you a call.

Mark, please assign this matter.  (Was a prior deal done out of Canada?)  Thank you.

Nicole, Mark Taylor will assign this matter to an attorney in our group.  I am unaware of "Alberta docs" and also am not aware of a master netting agreement with RBC.  Mark Taylor will advise as to who will be handling this file.  

Thanks.  Mary

Hi Mary - 

Guess things really come full circle at Enron - it looks like we may be working together again.  I am working in the Global Finance Group in London and Bill Appleby and I are looking to do an oil prepay with RBC.  I understand that you are one of the attorneys who will work on this with us.  I have actually never worked through the prepay documentation, and was wondering if you could send over some standard prepay doc language.  Better yet, if you have the Alberta docs, could you please send those (I believe that this was the last prepay we did with RBC).  Also, could we get a copy of the master netting agreement with RBC. 

Thanks so much.

Look forward to working with you again!

Nicole

That's what I'm hoping, but if not Barbara said she would work on it.

I take it Canada can do this out of their office via Greg.

To the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database, you've got it.  If you have any questions, Tana can probably help.

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the "sponsor" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I "approve" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a "placeholder" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these "approvals" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the "extranet" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark
   

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  "EWS - Legal" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  "Legal Web Maint."  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting "ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic", "Jurisdiction Document Library", and "European Document Libarary" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

I have spoken with Ron Carletta at the CFTC and explained our position - that is that as far as we know the LJM entities have only engaged in exempt transactions and are not required to register as CPO's.  He has my name and number if he has any further questions.

My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft. Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these that looked interesting:

Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.

I definitely think Mark's is a best bet if we can get in on Saturday.  Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?  Maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.  Unless you'd rather do something else on Sat. and go to the boat show Sunday -- any good Sunday brunch places?

Mark,

I think we should plan on something more casual for Friday evening.  Since
you are the foodie, please let me know which restaurant you would like to
have dinner at on Saturday evening and I'll make reservations today.  Also,
please let me know if there is another restaurant you would like to have
lunch at and I can make that reservation as well.

looking forward to seeing you!
Ted

My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure
what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft.
Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these
that looked interesting:

Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the
airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last
two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and
see what you think.

I was going through some old e-mails and found this one - is this something you have already handled?

Hello Mark

We are migrating the revamped Clickpaper application to production and we would like to have some guidence of how to handle our obligations, if any, to Ariba the vendor who supplied the original software engine for Clickpaper.  As we are replacing all of the Ariba application with our the EOL application we no long rely on Ariba for the application.  

Below are some questions we have regarding how we should proceed with notifying Ariba:

1)	We will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  Do we need to notify them?
2) 	What communication should we send to Ariba regarding our descision to terminate service?
3) 	How much do we owe them based on Early Termination.

Plus any other action you think necessary.  Attached is our contract with Ariba.  Please call me if you have any questions at 5-2824.

Regards,

Robbie Pateder
ENW-IT

Robbie - here is the contract with Ariba we were discussing yesterday.  Just want to get legal coverage of a couple of issues regarding how we should proceed once we stop using Ariba for clickpaper.com.

- we will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  do we need to notify them?
- i will send them the final accounting of transactions cleared through the ariba software at the end of 3rd quarter (they invoice us for a small fee for each transaction.)  I assume no further communication with Ariba will be required on my part.
- need to determine if we need to take any steps for contract termination, or simply let the arrangement expire next spring.  presumably we do not want to renew, nor do we want to terminate early on the small chance someone might want to use the licenses in the meantime.
 
Please let me know what questions you have...

thanks

Hi George.  I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  I was just going through some old e-mails and found this one that had somehow slipped through without being read.

I'm living in Houston these days.  I was actually in London on 9/11.  My flight back (scheduled for Wednesday that week) was cancelled and I finally made it back on that Sunday.  I'm sure there were much worse places to be stranded but it wasn't a lot of fun being away from home then.  I was traveling with a couple of good friends from NYC and it was pretty tense trying to track down their friends in Manhattan.

Mark K. is in NYC.  I have heard from him and he and his family are fine.  I think his company is now called American Century and he is still managing international mutual funds.

I was in Monmouth last weekend for homecoming.  Dahlquist, McGehee, McCabe, Perschke, Vance and Ehrenhart were there.  Ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at Monmouth and has joined ZBT.  

Hope you guys are doing well.

Mark  

Hope you are not still in New York City?   Is Mark K. still working for
20th Century in New York?

I agree with Susan that for non-EOL trades concluded by our traders in NYC and Houston that the ENA ISDA should be used.  Ms. Zivic had called me yesterday asking similar questions and that is the answer I gave her (subject to approval by the tax people).

Mark - Here is more to help you with the UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals question I asked you yesterday by email.

Frank,

FYI, attached is an e-mail from Janine Juggins who works in the Enron Europe Tax Dept.  I sent her an e-mail this morning trying to set up a call after the All Employee Meeting because I guessed that she had been looking at our issue from the London side.  She is going to call me at 4 p.m. Houston time this afternoon to discuss what she has found out to date.  Also, one of the attached e-mails suggests that all the London financially settled contracts will be entered into through EFET LLC (rather than ECTRIC) beginning 1 November.  I will confirm that with Janine when I talk with her this afternoon.

After reading the attached e-mail string, I still think it makes the most sense to have ENA enter into the transactions with the hedge funds (and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ENA ISDA).  This assumes, of course, that (1) the counterparties are US or Bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday, and (2) the New York or Houston office (rather than the London office) is executing and confirming these transactions.  We should confirm these assumptions with Robyn.  Do you see any reason why this approach would not work for non-EnronOnline transactions?  Also, based on the attached e-mail string, it looks like we're trying to set this up for both EnronOnline and  OTC contracts.  Were you aware of this?

I will give you a call shortly to discuss.

Best regards,
Susan

I was lucky enough to still have the last mail !

Are multiparty ISDAs a real option ? This seems like the simplest solution.

If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below.

With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?).

Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be.

To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost). 

Regards
Janine

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Justin

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side.

Russ
 

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

i agree - assuming you follow janine's approach, then no adverse UK regulatory issues will ensue

justin
I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

I am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested EOL fix.  My understanding was that if the assignment to ENA from ECTRIC happens automatically, that is equivalent -- for tax purposes -- to the UK trader binding ENA and results in bad tax consequences.

Mark, oh master of EOL - Please see the attached documents forwarded to us from London.  My assumption is that the trades by the hedge funds on EOL will have to be with ECTRIC because of the way EOL is set up.  Is this assumption correct or is there any way to trade UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals on EOL directly through ENA?  Thanks, as always, for your input.  Frank

Frank,

FYI, I just received this e-mail from Janine.  Have you already sorted out the structure with Robyn?  I would like to send an e-mail to Robyn, copying you and Janine with the summary of our discussions from yesterday.

What do you think about the proposed EnronOnline arrangement?

Best regards,
Susan

Lara,

a summary of what we just discussed 

Hedge Funds wishing to trade with Enron both OTC and online for products not offered by ENA.

1. OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.

2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

Are you still taking care of the Portland guys?  Do you have time to look at this?

Here is the document.

 

Mark,

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  

Please call or e-mail me with your comments.  My number is (503) 464-7795.

Thanks so much,

Steve

As long as this remains an internal only document, I do not have any problems with it.

Mark,

We are going to begin distributing a monthly newsletter for EnronOnline. This newsletter will be internal only for distribution to the trading floors including EOL, Enron Traders, Originators, Back & mid-office. There are some minor adjustments to be made to the layout and an additional quote to be added. 

Please let me know your thoughts. If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Let's get together with Sara and Mary to discuss how we should move forward with the forms.

Mark,
Do we want to propose they use the Industrial (which is the document I believe they were previously given) or do we want to ISDA'ize it for them to review?

Brent

Brent--there is a lot of talk down here about wanting to use a "short from" financial master for recurring trades with retail counterparties.  There have been a couple of drafts floating around in connection with the now defunct Fast Track initiative.  Is there a standard form of a short form financial master that has already been fully reviewed by the company and that would be ready and proper for EES to use?  Thanks.  MDS

I don't see why not.

Mark:

Should we amend the "Procedures for Entering into Transactions" in the RMT masters to provide for paperless transactions?

Our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger.  Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between Enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.  A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex.

Thanks again, NJD

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

I am NURA USMAN, a management consultant in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), I am a member of the Tenders Board a Committee in charge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals (C A P A). I got your contact during my quest for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (DPR) among which were;

1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and
downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation. - USD$2 Billion.
2) Contract for Turn around Maintenance (TAM) at the various Refineries in the country.
3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots) -USD$94 Million.

The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the tune of Thirty Six million, Five Hundred and sixty one thousand United States Dollars (USD$36,561,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the project officially commissioned.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance 70% to us in due course, or as will be advised in due course.
You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following
terms and conditions; Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry of
Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that the risk involved with your role shall be reduced to the barest minimal. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide beneficiary of the funds.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years of
meritorious service to my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action as we are well behind
schedule to enable us include this transfer in the Second quarter of the 2001 fiscal year contractual payments.

Do confirm your interest with a return email to usm2001ng@onebox.com

Thank You.

REGARDS,

NURA USMAN.

Thanks for forwarding all the e-mails while I was out last week.  I found this one in my in-box when I got back this morning.  Is it yours?
Dear Mark,

Thanks for keeping us updated on Tom. I am pleased to hear that he is making a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.

I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer so that I can feel the benefit of it.

I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some help.

Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking piling up).

At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.

We will look forward  to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.

Bye for now,

Deb

Please check your records and make sure your e-mails intended for me are addressed to the correct Mark Taylor.  There are two of us here at Enron and the other Mark is getting some of your EOL approvals e-mails.  

Stacey,

Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions:

1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.)
2.  German Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate:

Christophe's panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda.

The single greatest improvement you could possibly make would be to allow the making of reservations for reward travel.

Subj. test

Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question:

Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?" 

I spoke with Joe Collins (see below) this morning.  They are definitely thinking about the Commodity Exchange Act implications.  They don't know exactly who the customers will be or what products will be offered but have several ideas concerning how to avoid the CEA pitfalls -- maybe even including seeking no-action relief from the CFTC.  I gave him your name as someone he might hear from in the future concerning the transaction.

Mark

Gary Weiss with Refco called and suggested the person for you to talk to in regards to your questions is:

Joe Collins

He is an outside counsel they have been using for years and particularly to how they will set up a subset of their customers as eligible counterparties in this deal.  Let me knwo if you have any feedback.

Names of the panellists are available from the Baltic Exchange website (www=

When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are as=
sessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 11=
:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchang=
e, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of=
 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market ac=
tivity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The tanker =
market, for the most part, is very transparent. =20

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact sa=
me concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight=
 market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T=
9 route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Ch=
risti - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual=
 voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (M=
ay 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you=
 did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 =
and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on t=
he 5.10 p/mt flat which =3D 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo =3D 107,100 USD; vi=
ce versa if you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London=
 trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that sh=
ould have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it p=
ertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In addit=
ion, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude m=
arket particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the =
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months ti=
me - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any mar=
ket when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 =
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are =
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liabil=
ity sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a "last done"=
 philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexic=
o where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl ma=
rket.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 =
x 70,000 mt =3D 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (whe=
re the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into =
most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc.=
..  This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allow=
s the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider rang=
e of buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usua=
lly 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West A=
frica, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered o=
r off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize i=
f this is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surg=
e in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up=
 by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to =
get tight which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market=
 at the 70 x ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the carib=
s, or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly domin=
ated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they del=
iver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will proba=
bly have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, =
Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc. =20

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) e=
tc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns=
.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility=
, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed=
 to them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  S=
ome of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such =
as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..=
A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 move=
s p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point for=
mula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online=
.=20

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if h=
ave an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flo=
ws.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it t=
o the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping=
 in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to d=
eal with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are n=
ot going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line t=
hat trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced mu=
ch more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combine=
d result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rat=
es which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well a=
s limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any s=
upply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems=
 and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz =
with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.A=
merica.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once aga=
in be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far i=
n ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this o=
ff the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Cit=
ibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested=
 in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting=
 up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn presen=
tly has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing would=
 be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid=
 of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is alwa=
ys the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals con=
cluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competito=
r of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would b=
e in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only=
 one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be eas=
y to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was =
to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futu=
res rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are be=
ing done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific =
day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers w=
eren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global bo=
ok balancing tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to g=
et this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the grou=
p who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost mo=
mentum with legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the di=
rection of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott =
advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still=
 cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as=
 well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we=
 both follow now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to =
pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the =
buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the fre=
ight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explai=
ning worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.

As per my call.

Mark,
I hope this is of some use, I have schedule a meeting for Thursday @10:00 t=

sessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 11=
:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchang=
e, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of=
 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market ac=
tivity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The tanker =
market, for the most part, is very transparent. =20

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact sa=
me concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight=
 market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T=
9 route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Ch=
risti - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual=
 voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (M=
ay 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you=
 did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 =
and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on t=
he 5.10 p/mt flat which =3D 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo =3D 107,100 USD; vi=
ce versa if you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London=
 trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that sh=
ould have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it p=
ertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In addit=
ion, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude m=
arket particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the =
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months ti=
me - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any mar=
ket when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 =
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are =
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liabil=
ity sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a "last done"=
 philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexic=
o where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl ma=
rket.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 =
x 70,000 mt =3D 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (whe=
re the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into =
most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc.=
..  This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allow=
s the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider rang=
e of buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usua=
lly 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West A=
frica, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered o=
r off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize i=
f this is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surg=
e in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up=
 by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to =
get tight which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market=
 at the 70 x ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the carib=
s, or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly domin=
ated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they del=
iver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will proba=
bly have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, =
Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc. =20

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) e=
tc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns=
.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility=
, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed=
 to them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  S=
ome of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such =
as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..=
A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 move=
s p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point for=
mula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online=
.=20

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if h=
ave an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flo=
ws.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it t=
o the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping=
 in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to d=
eal with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are n=
ot going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line t=
hat trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced mu=
ch more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combine=
d result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rat=
es which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well a=
s limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any s=
upply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems=
 and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz =
with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.A=
merica.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once aga=
in be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far i=
n ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this o=
ff the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Cit=
ibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested=
 in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting=
 up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn presen=
tly has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing would=
 be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid=
 of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is alwa=
ys the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals con=
cluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competito=
r of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would b=
e in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only=
 one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be eas=
y to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was =
to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futu=
res rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are be=
ing done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific =
day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers w=
eren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global bo=
ok balancing tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to g=
et this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the grou=
p who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost mo=
mentum with legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the di=
rection of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott =
advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still=
 cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as=
 well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we=
 both follow now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to =
pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the =
buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the fre=
ight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explai=
ning worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.

Peter -

We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not =
been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because o=
f the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible wai=
ver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or h=
andled carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls =
generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the =
point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem=
. =20

Mark

Mark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter=
 for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit=
's requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i=
.e. use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timin=
g, notice addresses, etc.).  It seemed to me that the form they are using m=
ay have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is no=
t a drafting exercise on a case by case basis.  Practically, to the extent =
that the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no subst=
antive concern.  However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in comm=
odity markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circums=
tances where their credit is getting "tight", I can see the lack of contrac=
tual compliance perhaps being problematic.  Can somebody in your group deve=
lop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under th=
e Enron form, the "industrial" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please =
call Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter.

Thanks for the note.  I suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access (www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you) before you leave for the airport.  Since I'll have to check luggage, you can pretty safely assume it'll be 20 - 30 min. after the plane lands before I can hope to be at the curb.

Mark

Hey Mark -- Just checking in so you don't think I have forgotten you. I will
be waiting in the black Jeep outside of Continental's baggage claim area.
If I am not right there I might be circling to placate those annoying
traffic cops.  I won't be late.  My cell is 703-587-9245.  Amanda's is
703-598-8999.  See you on Saturday!

Bill

I'll be getting into Newark on Saturday the first on Continental flight

Let's discuss this.
June 7, 2001
Notice No. 01-191

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:
NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

RE:
EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the Friday, June 15, trading session.

For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots.

The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are:

			Any one month	        All months
Crude oil		10,000			20,000
Unleaded gasoline	5,000			7,000
Heating oil		5,000			7,000
Natural gas		7,000			12,000

Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped.

There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts).

These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract.

These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation.

Mark

               	Mark,   Do you have a number where I can call the technician in regards to checking the a/c system?  I don't know whether I need to make arrangements or if you will.  Please advise.   Regards,  Veronica Brock

ng a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from=
 a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of=
 contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingha=
m, a senior trader at Enron. "When we sell the product to the customer we r=
emain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind the=
ir position later. That is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham.   The storag=
e market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm del=
ivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant develo=
pment. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour di=
scounts on future purchases. "There is a premium in the price for firm deli=
very," says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participa=
nts are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment =
vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. "most storage equip=
ment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development o=
pens up the wholesale storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.   =09

uickly After Blockbuster Failure Houston-based energy and communications co=
nglomerate Enron's Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electro=
nics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid =
to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entert=
ain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electro=
nics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental t=
o Enron 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for Enro=
n after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announ=
ced March 9, that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies=
 for a video-on-demand service.   "The exclusive relationship has not yield=
ed the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this excit=
ing new on-demand service," explains Kenneth D. Rice, president and CEO of =
Enron Broadband Services.  "The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing,=
 but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtua=
lly complete," notes James Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warb=
urg. "I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of it=
ems to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving tr=
affic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly fr=
om the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I woul=
d suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggre=
ssive price targets on the company, which is what they did."  The failure o=
f the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year =
agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery=
 business.   "I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron=
 ," Bob Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tell=
s Broadband Networking News. "I think they will probably [get] one or two a=
nchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic."  The deal with Elec=
tronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the=
 importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network.=
 Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived f=
rom its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to pro=
vide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, a=
llowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is Enron 's core telecom=
 business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into=
 most analysts' forecasts on the company.   "I am confident that the conten=
t delivery business will be successful," says Ray Niles, a utilities equity=
 analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "The fact of the matter is they did get a=
nother deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get =
another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earni=
ngs forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not ver=
y successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast=
 for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is the=
ir competitive advantage."  "The reality is that no one had any earnings (f=
rom Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best," Yan=
nello adds. "It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It i=
s disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other=
 deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably=
 the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in."  Enron, whi=
ch produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various business=
es, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbust=
er deal.   "We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating," Yannell=
o says. "That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $2=
5 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has ha=
ppened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Block=
buster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we=
 expand that $25 telecom valuation."   =09

He told me, but I think it's still supposed to be under wraps.

Thanks for your note.  I came through pretty much OK but my garage was flooded and my house turned into a little island there for a few hours.

I have one, it has about $100 in it and I am not currently doing any

Changes to Descriptions of US Physical Gas Products Delivered Within Texas 

This change affects EnronOnline physical natural gas products delivered at Carthage, Exxon Katy and Waha locations. We have added the following language to the Product Long Descriptions of these affected products: 

This language will supersede the language in the first clause of your "General Terms and Conditions" (GTC) agreement, which presently states, "In the event that the Delivery Point for a transaction is located in the state of Texas, "Enron" shall mean Houston Pipe Line Company."

Please contact the EnronOnline Help Desk at (713) 853 HELP if you have any questions.

OK by me.
I would make it so it reads inone section ", then Enron will change its price to show a tighter market that reflects the price at which you are willing to buy from us or sell to us."
 
 
 
Your thoughts?
 
GP
 
Create Limit Order 
Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.

You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.

*Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.
 
 
  _____  

  [m1]EnronOnline itself isn't trading so we need to be careful not to give that impression.
  [m2]This is the key! - we are changing our price, not showing their price.

I think I am probably the right person.  Glad to help.

Hi Mark,

How are things?  

Enron is planning on obtaining membership of TOCOM, the Tokyo Commodities Exchange, ASAP, and I am contacting you at Alan's suggestion.

I will forward you the link to the TOCOM website and keep you in the loop moving forward.  Who should I liase with I wonder though, you or someone else in your department?

Susan is helping on identifying which of the two legal entities we have here we should use.

Thanks.

Jane McBride

Why would we need a new entity to take the membership?

Also, I want to make sure we coordinate our efforts to become a member of the exchange with Mark Taylor or his designee, since they have been involved in many of our efforts to gain memebership to regulated exchanges.

I would like to catch up with you this evening if possible by calling you from my home.

Alan

Dear Paul,

We are planning to apply for membership of TOCOM to trade (as principal) in kerosene and gasoline and as a first step need to get a document from METI under the CEL 145-5.  We have a form of the METI document from TOCOM which Maggy will fax to you in the morning FYI.

Pls help us get the necessary document from METI ASAP.

We are thinking of setting up a new company to make this application and should be able to sort this out next week but in the meantime pls advise us exactly what we will need to give you to move the METI process forward.

I am not sure whether this will be realistic if we need to incorporate a new entity but at this stage we hope to be trading within 6 weeks.

If you need to call me in the morning pls do so on 0901 840 2094. 

Thanks.

I provided these gentlemen with your name and number at 9 am PST this morning.  At 3:30 pm, they informed me that they have yet to receive all of the documents.
 
They have asked for:
 
1.  ISDA Master Agreement (Carol St. Claire faxed this to Knauf on Friday) which they have not received from Knauf.  They do have the Schedule to the Master Agreement, Attachment 1 (Legal Opinion), Paragraph 13, Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of Annex A, Letter of Credit Format (Schedule 1), and Exhibit A - form of Enron guaranty.
2.  Form of the Confirmation Agreement.
 
Sorry about the short timeframe, but I appreciate your help.
 
Thanks,
 
Laird

Approved

Mark,

Due to space constraints in the new Swapland, I would like to request one of the flat screen monitors for my location.  My eyes would also certainly appreciate it!

Thanks,
Stephanie

Approved

Mark,

Now that the Swapland build-out is complete--a flat screen computer would be helpful.

Approved

I don't know if it's possible, but with the move into the new office and space so tight, would it be possible for the swap paralegals to get flat screen monitors?  Just a thought...?

Now that we have all migrated to Outlook, please be sure to give everyone in the group access to view your calendar.  You will need to grant permissions to all group members both in the "Outlook Today" box at the top of your folders list and in the "Calendar" box. 

1.  Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and then "Folder List")
2.  Left click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up
3.  Left  click on the "Permissions" tab
4.  Add all of the swap group members as "Reviewers" to give them read access

Repeat the above process but starting on the "Calendar" line of your folders list.

Once everyone has done this, we will all be able to access each other's calendars by using the File Open menu.

It really was unbelievable.  Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much=

hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water go=
t so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to=
 get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It=
 looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab si=
nce some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the d=
oor sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in bi=
g trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I w=
ould have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the seco=
nd floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did com=
e inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water=
 inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midni=
ght the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no=
 standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all g=
one.

Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the lo=

to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!  I didn't see it myself but I hear =
that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd. =
 You missed a big one!

I got a Nikon Coolpix 880.  I didn't do much research so I don't know how
good/bad it is in comparison to other cameras on the market.  It was pretty
much an impulse buy.  I like it, but I don't know if a digital camera is
better than a regular camera.

Here are a few pictures from my trip to Lisbon.

Nice photos - they're incredibly detailed.  Are you happy with the camera?
I've thought about getting one but there are so many different
brands/options/details/prices I can't figure out which one I would want!

also got on a picture CD when they were developed:

can you send to me and i will forward??
Marty Rosenberg mentioned to me a comment you had regarding changing the
representation about "eligible swap participant" status to "eligible

for the term.  Do you have that cite?  Thanks.

Just wanted to let you know that I plan on attending the June 25 meeting along with Jonathan Marsh and perhaps one or two others from Enron.

I have your travelers Checks.  Are you mobile yet?

I have to agree.  It sounds like a fundamental lack of consideration situation.  If we are the buyer and actually believe there is value here, we should be willing to pay SOME kind of premium, even if it is fairly small.

  Mark,

  I have a trader who is trying to do a stand alone Put option where we are the option buyer.  There is no premium or other consideration.  I have a real problem with the enforceability of this deal.  Any thoughts?

I'm happy to take a look at the proposed language and coordinate with the lawyers in London and Singapore.  The difficulty in making the Long Description language the same around the world is that the underlying GTC's are necessarily different because they are governed by different laws.  We'll see what we can do.

Mark,

I know that we recently finalized the Houston product description for the Tanker Freight Swap.  Please see attachment at the end of this e-mail about Singapore's description.

Ultimately, we would like to have a global product description for EnronOnline.  I don't know if Houston is the "final" say but if we could get Houston, London, and Singapore (and possibly any future Enron location) to have all the same standard production description for Tanker Freight Swaps, then it would greatly help Enron in marketing these products.  The factors that would change been product description would be: 
size of ship, route, exchange (pricing index), and term.

If you could please talk with Robert Quick (London) and Debbie Nicholls/Paul Henking (Singapore), then maybe all three locations can agree to some kind of standard.

Homer

i would suggest we try and get the legal guys in houston to have a look at this language as well ; it would make sense if all the descriptions had the same wordings apart from the size / route / exchange etc. 

Matt/Robert,

I understand that there seems to be a delay in finalising the SG Tanker Freight Swap Index language as there are problems arising from possibly not covering the appropriate Worldscale flat rate for the Determination Period.  I have spoken to Scott Moncrief as to the the issues which seem to have arisen. 

I have attached new wording below, which should cover if the Worldscale flat rate changes at anytime so the latest applicable flat shall be taken for the relevant Determination Period especially if they trade a forward starting swap effective in the following year.

Please review as we would like to use the attached for all SG and UK Tanker Freight Swaps.  I have attached all relevant wording for all three porducts which may be traded OTC and EOL so our clients receive consistant confirms, rather than different variations.

Let me know your comments as we need to finalise this wording by Monday or lastest Tuesday to be able to post the long description into EOL.

Many Thanks

Debbie

Hope you had a good vacation.  Thanks for forwarding all of my mail.  Now that I've been migrated to Outlook it may actually get worse instead of better.  My assistant is trying to see if there isn't something the IT people can do.

FYI

Chris, Mike & Mark,

I want to pass along my thanks to Enron's legal and credit staff for their substantial contribution in finalizing the transaction with Knauf.  Carol St. Clair, Tracy Ngo and Ed Sacks did a tremendous job developing a structure that made sense for all parties and finalizing an ISDA agreement in 3 working days - with a German based company no less.   Ed and Tracy quickly developed Credit terms and provided valuable input into the transaction structure.  Carol worked tirelessly developing and negotiating the ISDA with Knauf.  Additionally, she sought out counsel within Enron familiar with German law allowing us to ascertain the appropriate authority levels within Knauf to execute the ISDA.  It was the effort of these individuals that allowed this deal to happen.

I have extended my thanks and appreciation to them, but wanted to make you were aware of their contribution.

We booked a 3 year, fixed price swap in N.  California originating just under $1 MM.

Thanks,

Laird

While I am out next week, you can call on the following lawyers if you need assistance:

EnronOnline generally (including "enhanced limit orders") - Barbara Gray (x36832)
Private e-marketplaces - Anne Koehler (x33488)

Louise Kitchen has asked to be included and receive copies of our answers.

I'm still concerned about the terms "price" and "quotation."  My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments."  Do I have this all wrong?

Matt tks for the points

with the exception of the first issue re EEFT arranging etc, I wd say that yr proposed amendments shd certainly apply to the UK freight swaps. I will just check with the commercial people to make sure that the Index is going to be IITRA and that they are happy to go for the flat rate on the last day of the Determination Period. tks

Mark / Robert / Justin

I refer to Debbie Nicholl's e-mail on how Houston/London/Singapore language for freight swaps should be consistent. Here are my comments on the Singapore product which I drafted in consultation with Paul Henking/Pat Markey who would be trading the product here.  Your views would be most appreciated:

1.	1st para : "as arranged by Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited" would not apply to Singapore and therefore not included. 

2. 	Index defininition:

(a)	In the 1st sentence, I think reference should be to "the arithmetic average of quotations" instead of "the arithmetic average of the prices" to be consistent with the other swap products Singapore has on-line. This also distinguishes between a "quotation" which is an IITRA published quote and "price" which in existing EOL products refers to the bid/offer price on EOL.  

(b)	I understand the bid/offer prices on EOL for freight swaps are quoted in "Worldscale" or "WS" values instead of US$, hence the 2nd last para which reads :

"The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, expressed as "Worldscale" or "WS", which shall be the Contractual Currency."

(c)	Since both quotations and prices are "Worldscale" or "WS" values (ie. a flat rate determined by the route X the daily variable rate), I have expressed it as "The flat rate (expressed as "Worldscale" or "WS") used in the quotations and to calculate the price..." so as to clarify that the flat rate is a determinant of the "quotations" as well as "price".

(d)	As identified in the Houston product, "Worldscale" is published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.

(e)	Traders here have picked "the last day of the Determination Period" as the day to determine the flat rate (ie. "WS") instead of Transaction Date to avoid issues which may arise from "WS" amendments occurring in the middle of a Determination Period  (eg. whether to take a weighted average when calculating the arithmetic average or would the prevailing rate apply for the whole Determination Period) or between Transaction Date and Effective Date (in the case of forward transactions).

Since the flate rate effective on "the last day of the Determination Period" was chosen, I left out the language which appears in the Houston/London product : "including any relevant forthcoming amendments published prior to or on such date which may become effective prior to or on the last day of the Determination Period".  I also didn't entirely understand the reference to "including" and whether it was intended to mean that all the flat rates will be taken into account (weighted average?) or just the prevailing one. I understand from Robert that when the London product was drafted, it may not have been brought to Legal's attention that the flat rate may be amended (albeit unlikely), anytime during the year in addition to the annual amendments.

Attached for your easy reference is the draft Singapore product long description

 << File: Freight Swap.doc >> 

Thanks. I look forward to your views. 

Best regards
Matt

 

I have been requested to look at the attached wording from Houston and Singapore which I understand London has previously agreed, as the deadline to go live on EOL for next Monday has been missed.  

I have highlighted the inconsistencies as follows:

Blue highlights mean - Singapore, London and Houston legal need to agree on standard wording for consistency.

Mauve highlights mean - Remove as EEFT are not the arrangers for Singapore Financial transactions 

Red highlights mean - Inserted for consistency. Singapore, London and Houston legal to agree

Black underlined means - Only inserted in Houston language, Singapore London and Houston to agree 

Please review the attached and finalise your agreement between all three legal departments by forwarding a new set of standardised wording so that Tanker Freight is consistent and EOL can forward your wording to other departments for approval.  If we can do this asap EOL can post these products hopefully to go live on 2 July.

Thanks and Regards

I would very much like to get some time with each of these people while I'm there.  I have already arranged some time with Jonathan Marsh on Monday morning since he knows a lot about the ISDA meeting that afternoon.  I would prefer, if possible, to have some time with each of Paul Simons and Justin Boyd before the rest of the crew so that I can hear a bit about them before I actually sit down with them.  Don't worry if that's not possible.  I'd also like to get some time with each of Edmund Cooper, Mark Elliott, Mark Evans, Robert Quick and Marcus Von Bock.  Mark Evans would be best towards the end of the stay - maybe lunch on Wed.?

Please advise.  See request below.

Thanks!

I have been advised by Paul Simons that Mark Taylor will be visiting London on Monday 25th June to attend an ISDA Energy and Developing Products Committee Meeting.  Paul has suggested that Mark may want to meet up with some of the new lawyers in the legal department namely Ian Brungs, Paul Johnson, Jonathan Marsh (Compliance Officer), Sophie Martin, Sarah Sinclair, Peter Traung and Janet Wood.  Please can you check with Mark whether this is the case and if so, please contact me and we can fix up some time in their diaries.

Many thanks for your help.

Kind regards.

If you really think you'll need to get in touch while I'm overseas you can try my international cell phone #  44-7881-512-535 which is a London phone number but works throughout Europe and North America.  And of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at (877)855-2081 or send an e-mail to my pager at 8778552081@pagenetmessage.net.  But the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that I'm just plain unreachable since I turn them all off and let the machines do the answering -- which may not impress Joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers.

you only have ONE cellphone - Joe would not be impressed.

Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.  If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.

We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.

Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.

Mark

P.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.  We're trying to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us.
Mark, I wanted to track down two procedural matters with you respecting financial confirms:

1.	Currently we generate approximately 40-50 confirmations each day between ECC and ENA/RMT, which creates some significant administrative and filing burdens.  I am generally aware, but not precisely clear on the details, that there has been a recent decision that for certain counterparties, or at least with respect to EOL transactions, that Confirms are no longer necessary.  If in fact this is the case, can we do away with the formal confirmation procedures between ECC and ENA/RMT where there is not likely to be any dispute.  [Morris/Laura, if we do away with the formal confirms between ECC and ENA/RMT, and provided that we have a TAGG or Sitara Deal Ticket, is there any ancillary tax purpose for generating confirms between ECC and ENA/RMT?]

2.	In the same vein, for certain non-inter-company financial transactions completed on EOL, I understand that it has been approved not to send Confirms.  Again, Mark can you please clarify this policy for me, including how we determine for which counterparties this ought to apply in Canada.  It was my (again general) understanding that it may have depended upon the wording of the Master Agreement with the counterparty and/or the volume of  transactions executed with the counterparty.

Please let me know.

Regards,

We agreed from a legal perspective and sent the language along to the EOL people to make sure that it works on the system.  I haven't heard back.

Mark,

I am assuming that you are back from your London trip.

Was there success in the standardization of the Tanker Freight Swap product description?
Or was it agreed to keep the product description differentiated regionally?  
If global standardization has been implemented, has Carlos Alatorre been notified yet about any necessary changes?  

I am just checking to see where we are now to see what needs to be done next.

Thanks,

Dale - 

I know you are getting frustrated with the delay on counterparty approvals.  We have asked Stephanie Panus, one of the other paralegals in the group, to get started on this process and hope that that will speed things along.  Tana is in the process of showing her the ropes and I am hopeful that they will make significant progress by the end of the week.

Mark

Mark - 

May we ask that there be some concentration on the dated items; which are almost a month in the queue. I am certain that our phones will be ringing again soon.

Yes, I was working with Justin Boyd and Ian Brungs in the legal dept. I think they sent the revisions to Arfan.

Mark,

Please let me know when you hear back from the EOL people.
I am assuming London EOL people (?) because the Houston EOL people (Rob Cass / Kevin Meredith) were not yet aware of any forthcoming changes.
I just wanted to make sure that the Houston EOL team also stays up to date so that they can make changes too on our Houston EOL system.

	Futures Trading SEC Proposals Would Implement CFMA,  Altering BD Registration Requirements	

The Securities and Exchange Commission June 26 published proposed rules to implement parts of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, including amendments to the SEC's broker-dealer registration requirements and Form BD (Release No. 34-4455, 6/20/01; 66 Fed. Reg. 34042, 6/26/01). 
Those amendments would implement CFMA Section 203, which allows futures commission merchants and introducing brokers that are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to register with the SEC as broker-dealers for the limited purpose of effecting transactions in certain security futures products. SEC registration in such cases would be accomplished by filing notice with the SEC. 
In addition, the SEC proposed a conditional exemption from registration under 1934 Securities Exchange Act Section 15(a). The proposed exemption would "provide guidance on the extent to which a broker-dealer registered by notice may trade security futures products," the SEC said. It would allow a broker-dealer registered by notice to trade any security futures products as long as the broker-dealer did not become a member of a registered national securities exchange or national securities association. 
Finally, the commission proposed changes to Regulation S-P, which was adopted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. "These amendments would revise certain provisions of Regulation S-P in light of section 124 of the CFMA, which makes the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act applicable to activity regulated by the CFTC." These amendments would permit futures commission merchants and introducing brokers registered by notice with the SEC as broker-dealers to comply with Regulation S-P by adhering to the CFTC's financial privacy rules, the SEC said. 
Comments are due by July 26, 2001, and should refer to File No. S7-13-01.

Rats - I thought I had picked a day when we were all going to be here - your day off was not listed on my group calendar.  Sorry!

Mark,

I will be UNABLE to attend being as I will be on Vacation.

Hope you all have a fun time.

Susan

I'd like to take the entire group out to lunch next Wednesday.  We have a reservation at Ninfa's on Navigation for 11:45.  Since they won't seat us unless everyone is there and we lose the table if we aren't there on time, I'd like to ask everyone to be ready to leave the building by 11:15.  We will arrange for cars on Wednesday morning.  Please let me know if you are NOT going to attend.  If I don't hear from you I will assume you are coming.

Mark

Thanks Chris.  I've taken a quick look at these and my reaction is (1) as to the definitions of specified transaction, we will probably not want to sign on to the expansive provision as an end-user, but it may make sense from the dealers' perspective and (2) we have needed exactly what is being proposed regarding the calculation of termination payments for some time and I view this as a major step forward.  Bottom line, I don't think we will be advocating the MFA position.

Mark - I am sure you aware of this, but wanted to let you know that MFA asked for our help.  FYI.

	Chris,

		Good to talk with you today.  Attached please find the end
user letters objecting to some of the proposed changes to the ISDA Master
Agreement.  As I mentioned, MFA, the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers,
the Committee for the Investment of Employee Benefit Assets (CIEBA) and the
End Users of Derivatives Council (the old EUDA) have all sent letters to
ISDA saying that they have problems with some of the proposed changes.  We
met with ISDA once, back in March.  CIEBA and EUDC have both asked for
meetings with ISDA.  Not sure if there has been any meetings or whether they
are scheduled.

		Obviously we believe that the documents need to be fair to
end users.  We believe it is in ISDA's best interests to not go forward with
changes which end users object to.  Any assistance you can provide on this
point would be appreciated.

		 <<ISDA Package 4.2.01.doc>>  <<CIEBA.ISDALetter.doc>>
<<Dow.Jones.6.15.01.doc>>

		By the way, I don't have a copy of the EUDC letter, but the
Dow Jones article references it as being sent in May.

		Have a great 4th.  Hope the twins are sleeping well.  Please
let me know if we at MFA can be of any assistance to you.

		Regards,

		Pat

Kelly:

Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:

Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.

The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.

I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.

 On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!

I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.

I will not be able to attend.

Please plan on attending our final Credit/Legal seminar.  This seminar will be held Wednesday, July 11th, from 2:00 - 3:30 p.m. in EB49c3 and will be a continuation of our discussions of the ISDA Master Agreement.  The topics for this session will be:

Hedge Funds (Frank Sayre)
Canada (Mary Cook)
Mexico (Francisco Pinto-Leite)

Refreshments will be provided.  Please e-mail Becky Spencer, if you are unable to attend.

We discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for EnronOnline transactions in our last group meeting.  It looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals.  No one should end up with more than two or three of them that way.  Janet Moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group.  The gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions.

We should talk about this when you have a minute.

A CFTC conference call is scheduled for Friday, July 13, from 8 a.m. - 11 a.m..  The dial in no. is as follows:

This is fine with me.  In the past, Dave wanted to see all of the ETA and PA amendments that we negotiated with EnronOnline users.  I take it these should go to you now.  If it comes to you from me, Leslie Hansen or Mark Greenberg, you can assume that Legal has signed off and it is just coming to you for final approval.  Let us know if you no longer want to receive these.

Hi Mark,

Can you please take a look at this letter and see if you are acceptable to the changes requested by the counterparty. In case you are not the right person can you let me know who should take a look at this.

Mark:

    I apologize for not getting this to you earlier.  This is a draft of a
license under which Enron Networks could disclose its data formats.  It is
very basic, but I think covers the points that we discussed last week.

    I will be out of town on vacation, starting tomorrow.  But I have
briefed Rasmani Bhattacharya, an attorney at V&E who works with me on this
types of projects, and she can make any amendments or changes that may be
necessary.  You can reach Rasmani at 713 758-2109.

    I have left some questions in the form, which need to be addressed and
edited.  Also, we should ask Jay what we should call these formats.  I just
made up a term.  He will be able to come up with a better one, I am sure.

    Rasmani, you should have rights to this document, but if there is some
problem, just save it as a new document and go from there.  The iManage
number is 599547.  Also, please feel free to expand and clarify the
disclaimers and limits of the license.  Also, would you get with Tony Chan
and go over this draft with him.  I based this draft in large part on what
he gave me.  Thanks.

FYI

Francisco, I fully agree with you, and I thank you for being so pro-active with our business inMexico.  I can't see how could we progress without ideas like this one...  You are by far, the best lawyer we have had in the Enron de Mexico Team...  I appreciate it.   Best regards. 

I am making a couple of important changes in our process that you should be aware.

In the future, we will not be generally requiring legal opinions to be delivered with the Deemed Isdas (we may however require them on a case by case basis).  We will still require legal opinions with the Master Agreements.  Also, as you all know one of the problems to get from Mexican counterparties is the agent for service of process.  In the future we will be sending as part of our package the names, fees and form of contracts for three agents for service of process.  All the Mexican counterparties need to do is to choose one, sign the contract (it is normally one page by fax) and send it in.   Because this will expedite our counterparties getting agents for service of process, I will start to ask for such information both in the Deemed Isda and the Master.

Finally, I just contacted the confirm desk to ask them to, in the future, always inform me of any Deemed Isdas they get executed from mexican counterparties.  Like this I can know and let you know exactly who is signing these documents and who is not.  Ideally, we should get these back within a matter of two to three days.  If not we should at least attempt to start contacting the counterparties.

Just in case you are wondering why I am so concerned about the deemed Isda.  Before we have a Deemed Isda executed, if there is a problem, I will have to litigate in Mexico under Mexican law (ENA does not like this option).  Only after I get an executed Deemed Isda, I am out of Mexican courts and Mexican law.

let me know if you have any questions and or suggestions to optimize our process.

The above was duly authorized and will be implemented immediately.

Thanks -- I agree.

I liked her and found her to be articulate.  Her resume indicates a good legal background conducive to what I understand to be the type of work for the position, including her desire to work on a part time basis.   

Cordially,
Mary Cook

I have the pager with me but don't know if it's working.  Would you mind sending a test message?

Did you set up a lunch for me for tomorrow with David Mitchell?  It isn't on my calendar - or at least not the calendar I can access from the road.

Hope you had a good weekend!

Mark

Everyone I've talked to was thoroughly impressed.  I'd be happy to proceed but did get an e-mail from Cheryl on Friday indicating she wanted to talk about it...not sure yet what that means.  I'm out of town today and tomorrow - if you have time to stop by Cheryl's office & ask, that might help.  My only concern with Kim at all is that she probably can't start until September.  Probably worth the wait though.

Mark,

What was the feedback on Kim?  Sorry about the HR mixup on the scheduling sheet that indicated that she was to work for me.  Cheryl Nelson interviewed her without knowing the real opportunity was for your group.  Oops.

Let me know how you would like me to proceed.

Michelle

This is a test e-mail page.

Here is the list of the counterparties they want to put these agreements in place with and the lawyers that have been assigned to them.  As you can see there are a number that have yet to be assigned.  Would you please pass these out equitably among yourself, Frank, Mary and Francisco -- particularly those in town next week who will have a chance to move them forward.  Kim Theriot is very anxious that we make headway on these.  The counterparties marked with an asterisk are the most urgent.  I will forward the docs I have received from Stacy and Janet as separate e-mails.

Thanks!

I will be happy to attend.

I'm afraid I will have to be on the phone for this one.

Using your numbers:
1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to.
2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.
3. Yes
4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules. 

OK - so based on this document:

1) Are we registered with the CFTC?
2) Are we prohibited from transacting with hedge funds ("investment company")?
3) Are the "exemption conditions" with which the facility must comply just the conditions listed in the document?
4) Could you clarify: Do the conditions described in the document apply to us now, or only if we become "regulated"?

As per our conversation, I understand that FX is subject to even less stringent requirements than our current commodities are. 

Thanks,

Dave

Attached is a brief outline of the requirements for electronic trading facilities for transactions in exempt commodities.  Exempt commodities are all commodities other than financial commodities (e.g. interest rates, currencies, securities) and agricultural commodities.

 << File: Electronic Trading Facility for Exempt Commodities.doc >> 

David - 

Apologies for my silence.  I need to check with Mark H. and make sure he is still on board but I think it is a good idea and would suggest we try and schedule something for early September.

Mark

Mark,

Is this still of interest?

Two weeks ago, a member of the FRBNY legal staff asked to meet with AIG
staff to discuss AIG's present and proposed retail swap activities. I
responded that AIG does not now and has no plans to engage in that activity.
For that reason, I stated that it was premature to consider the need to
regulate an activity that does not now exist and that ought to be the
agencies response to Congress.

Have you had a chance to look at this?  The attached file is the new index (website address) and the following language is another example of an index currently on EnronOnline which uses a web address.

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered during Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period.  The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC on its official web site currently located at ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings "PJM - Locational Marginal Pricing Files; Western Hub"  (the "Index").

Please find attached the credit worksheet, with credit terms, for the proposed ISDA between ECC and Canadian Hunter Resources, by its managing partner Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd.  We recently executed an EEI with this counterparty which was heavily negotiated and I would like the credit terms in this ISDA to mirror as closely as possible the agreed upon terms in the EEI.  Consequently, I am sending to you, via I/O mail, a copy of the cover sheet to the existing EEI for your reference and review.  Please call with questions or comments, and please put this on your **High** Priority List as we have a very short time frame for getting this ISDA completed and executed.

I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).  I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!

They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?

Here is the first of the no more confirms agreements.  Can you please handle this one?  Even though it came to me over two weeks ago I didn't realize this was ready for us until the back office and EOL people called asking for it (entirely my fault) so there is a certain urgency to it.  I also have counterparties for Francisco, Sara and Frank to get started on, but I thought you would be better for the urgent one since you have the most experience with these issues.

I tweaked the one that I sent you yesterday.  Here's the  final version.

Thanks for the offer, but I can't get away that early without taking vacation time.  At this point my flight gets in at 8:36 p.m.

I'm afraid Amanda's friends will be disappointed.  The two-step, a polka or maybe a C&W line dance is more in the Texas line; they'd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable.

If you can get a plane that arrives in newark at 6 - or earlier - ill pick you up in newark on friday. As an added incentive ill take you to the bear cafe in wdstk to eat - it is fabulous.

 Also if you want to bring your tux or your tiara we will store it before the cruise.

I made a massage appointment for you on saturday with this fabulous massage lady. To die for.

Th dj only plays latin/sala music.  Amandas friends think you are going to teach them to dance because you are from houston.

I asked for a return date for you of September 12 which is the day I'm coming back.  But since I will be going to Houston and you will be going to NYC we won't be traveling together anyway.  Would you rather stay an extra day or two?

Veronica,

The lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of August at the same rent.  That means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 30 days notice to the other if they want to.  That's ok with me if it works for you.

Mark

Mark,

Have you made a decision on the lease and rent increase/decrease?  Please
advise.  Thanks!

Let's plan on it.  My only question is whether I'll be able to come on Friday eve. or have to wait until Sat. a.m.  Do you have plans that would make one day better than the other?  I have a 4:00 flight back to Houston on Sunday afternoon and will be able to get a rent car at the Newark airport so you won't have to worry about transport for me.

Tom Gros and the Commodity Logic team will be presenting a demo tomorrow of the various modules which go live in the next week or so.  The demos are scheduled for 1:30 to 2:30 and 3:00 to 4:00 tomorrow afternoon in EB5C2.  Please feel free to attend one of the sessions if you are interested.

Here is the Doug Leach/Russell Dyk e-mail.

Mark--please review and let's discuss. Will call you tomorrow am.

Doug and Larry  -
I would say we're at least 6 weeks away from getting the first fund (Tudor) set up to transact gas, crude, products, etc. on EOL. 

The primary reason for this is the way Tudor - and most of these funds - are set up. Normally the funds have at least two separate entities, one onshore and one offshore, so that they can attract both US and overseas investors. 

We have separate ISDAs w/ each fund, yet in practice the fund manager will trade, say, 100 lots which is then split in some way between the two funds. While this works in practice right now, with the funds calling in and us executing orders, it would not work at present on EOL unless they traded as separate entities. Because one manager/trader usually trades on behalf of both entities, he would have to be clicking on two separate EOL screens to trade. 

When I spoke w/ Larry 2 weeks ago, he asked whether the funds could trade on EOL through only one of the two entities. I brought this up w/ them and the reply was that it's not possible. The reason is that the funds are set up legally according to certain guidelines, one of which is that trades are allocated among the various funds according to capital in each fund. To put all of one trade in one fund would violate those guidelines, as the manager would be favoring one class of investors - say, foreign ones if it were only the offshore fund that traded on EOL - over another by putting all of one trade in one fund. If the trade was a winner, the foreign investors would benefit more than domestic ones. If it's a loser, it would be the other way around.  

The way we're proceeding to work around this is to draft an a legal agreement that basically gives one entity (a "superfund") the ability to trade on EOL on behalf of all the funds with which we have ISDAs. We have spoken to the funds about this, as well as to Dan Diamond and Savita Puthigai from EOL, and all have agreed that this is the best way forward. 

There are two funds that we deal w/ which have only one entity, which would make transacting on EOL much easier. 

One of those - Harvard - already has transaction rights on EOL. Harvard, however, is not going to be a flow customer, which is why I noted above that Tudor is really the first fund that will transact regularly on EOL. Harvard's focus is longer term and typically more option-oriented. The one thing they might trade on a more frequent basis - as I mentioned to Larry - is the WTI/Brent spread. Other funds have expressed interest in seeing this product online as well.

The second fund we are still negotiating an ISDA with, but that should be signed within the next 2 weeks. 

As you can see, the funds are not all set up the same way. Moreover, many have different focuses - i.e. short-term, longer-term, fundamentally driven, technically-driven, etc. Some are also restricted by their charter from trading prompt-month instruments. Our goal is to get all of them set up on EnronOnline; but not all of them will be flow customers. 

All the funds currently have guest IDs on EOL. We worked an arrangement w/ Dave Forster and Mike Bridges of EOL under which the funds' guest accounts are good for 2-6 months. So the funds are seeing EOL prices, and we very often transact on those prices - at this point more on the gas side than crude. However, recent trades we have initiated on the crude/products side - for example, a Cal02 fuel oil crack - have been done b/c a fund has seen the price on EOL. Moreover, trades we pitch are often referenced to EOL prices, so that the funds can monitor them for their desired levels. 

Chris Glaas has visited many of the funds to pitch his EOL DFL product, which would allow them to more easily and transparently play in the Dated Brent market. So has Andy James, from the shipping group, who was pitching both dry bulk cargo and wet tanker route markets on EOL. When we last spoke, Larry introduced me to the TAS gasoline product. We're definitely interested in the new products that are out there, and are happy to talk to the funds about specific ones. 

As far as internal problems, the only one we have is the lack of adequate numbers of legal staff to draft and negotiate ISDAs and these EOL omnibus agreements w/ the funds. ENA/EGM has assigned one lawyer to us - Frank Sayre - and he is also saddled w/ other responsibilities so that his time is very constrained. 

Just to summarize, as far as status on EOL, all the funds except Harvard have guest IDs for EOL. We have signed ISDAs w/ five and are negotiating ISDAs w/ seven more. In addition, we are in discussion w/ two other funds. Three of the funds - one with which we're negotiating an ISDA and the two with which we're in discussion - are program ("black box") funds. Our specific pitch to them was EOL, as it has more transparent pricing and often tighter spreads than they see on the floor. Of all the funds, these we expect would provide the most flow business to EOL. 

Sorry for the long explanation to a short request - if you have more questions I'd be happy to discuss them over the phone. I'm at 212 702 3914.  
Regards,
Russ

Where does the Enron NYC office stand with get the hedge funds signed up to use EnronOnline for crude and products? Could you please give us a list of the funds and the status of each regarding EnronOnline? If there is a legal or credit problem with getting them set up would you please identify who or where that internal problem is? 

Do I assume correctly that dinner is at home in NJ rather than at home in NY?

How did it go?

(sorry for the spelling errors guys but I am rushing out the door because I am not feeling well.  If anyone needs to talk further with me, call me at home at 713-785-6152 in an hour.
Mark, 

Mike Fowler asked me to send you a note indicating tthat he wated to come by and see you about this contract.  As you may recall from our conversation last week, this is the agreement in which the counterparty absolutely refuses to give Enron any limitation of liability provisions.  I have asked the counterparty via email to reconsiderr this point about five times and the last request/email was not returned so I know they are not moving on this point.  Mark says it is up to you.   

The counterparty -- SNL --  did negotiate/give on some other points which otherwise but the contract into compliance with any other material policies/guidelines; so it is otherwise a good contract for us.  For more information on the counterparty, see the note from Sheila Glover below, check out SNL's website or I can discuss further with you.

Cheryl,
In response to your questions.

SNL is an Informational Service targeted for analysis of the Financial Services Industry.  The information provides historical financial and current analysis for Financial Services companies.  SNL is the only comprehensive provider of this information that we are aware of.  Financial Trading is trading a portfolio for Financial Services and requires a relevant research tool.

FACTSET is currently used.  However, FACTSET does not have the company coverage nor does it analyze financial services companies in a relevant way.  FACTSET is slanted more toward industrial firms.  

The agreement is a subscription to the database for a one year term, requiring positive renewal.  The initial year term is $15,000 a year and the second year is capped at a 10% increase.

We do not use this service at the current time.

FYI
Attached is the most recent Sec. 562 proposal responding to FDIC's concerns.

Modifications include:

a) incorporation of  burden of proof language into statute. This language
was originally refrenced only in the legislative history language.(i.e if
the timing of the measurement of damages is challenged by the trustee, the
burden of proving that the measurement of the date of
liquidation,termination, acceleration would not be commercially reasonable
... etc. lies with the swap participant .. master netting participant....

b) additional legislative history language strengthening non-application of
Section 562 to FDIA (562 has no impact on contracts/agreements othern than
those specified in the section)

c) additional langauge in legislative history explaining that the need to
measuring damages prior to date of termination/liquidation/acceleration is
rare but will occur in unusual circumstances (language cites the
disapperance of the Kuwaiti Dinar after the 1990 invasion.

Please call if you have any questions.  Many thanks!

Here is our proposal, based on yesterday's meeting (sorry you weren't
there).  We believe this is responsive to the concerns that were raised,
and hope that you agree.  I am circulating this to those at yesterday's
meeting for whom I have e-mail addresses;  I trust you will circulate to
others in the PWG.  Thanks Mike.

Sec. 562 - Timing of damage measurement in connection with [protected
contracts]

If the trustee rejects a [protected contract or agreement] or if [a
protected counterparty] liquidates, terminates, or accelerates such
contract or agreement, damages shall be measured as of the earlier of --

(1) the date of such rejection; or

(2) the date or dates of such liquidation, termination, or acceleration
unless:

     (A)  there are not any commercially reasonable determinants of value
as of such date or dates, in which case such forward contract merchant,
stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
or swap participant shall measure damages as of the earliest subsequent
date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of
value; or

     (B) there are no determinants of value as of such date or dates, in
which case such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial
institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial
participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant
shall measure damages as of the earliest date or dates after, or the latest
date or dates before, such date or dates on which there are commercially
reasonable determinants of value.

For the purposes of subsection (2), if damages are not measured as of the
date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration and the trustee
challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward contract
merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency,
repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement
participant, or swap participant,  such forward contract merchant,
stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
or swap participant has the burden of proving that there were no
commercially reasonable determinants of value or no determinants of value
as of such date or dates.

Legislative History:

Section 910 adds a new section 562 to the Bankruptcy Code providing that
damages under any swap agreement, securities contract, forward contract,
commodity contract, repurchase agreement or master netting agreement will
be calculated as of the earlier of (i) the date of rejection of such
agreement by a trustee or (ii) the date or dates of liquidation,
termination or acceleration of such contract or agreement.  Section 562
provides an exception to the rule in (ii) if there are no commercially
reasonable determinants of value as of such date or dates,  in which case
damages are to be measured as of the earliest subsequent date or dates
after such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable
determinants of value, or if there are no determinants of value as of such
date or dates, in which case damages are to be measured as of the earliest
subsequent date or dates after such date or dates or the latest date or
dates before such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable
determinants of value.  Although it is expected that in most circumstances
damages would be measured as of the date or dates of liquidation,
termination or acceleration, in certain unusual circumstances, such as
dysfunctional markets or liquidation of very large portfolios, there may be
no commercially reasonable determinants of value, and in other unusual
circumstances, such as war conditions, there may be no determinants of
value whatsoever.  Measuring damages as of a date or dates before the date
of liquidation, termination or acceleration will occur in very unusual
circumstances.  An example was the need to use the most recent available
information for the Kuwaiti Dinar after the virtual disappearance of the
currency after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

The non-bankrupt party is not given unlimited discretion to determine the
date as of which damages are to be measured.  Instead, its actions are
circumscribed unless there are no "commercially reasonable" determinants of
value (or no determinants of value whatsoever) for it to measure damages on
the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration.  The
references to "commercially reasonable" are intended to reflect existing
state law standards relating to a creditor's actions in determining
damages.  New section 562 provides that if damages are not measured as of
the date or dates or liquidation, termination or acceleration and the
trustee challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward
contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing
agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement
participant, or swap participant, such forward contract merchant,
stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
or swap participant has the burden of proving the absence of any
commercially reasonable determinants of value or any determinants of value,
as the case may be.

New section 562 is not intended to have any impact on the determination
under the Bankruptcy Code of the timing of damages for contracts and
agreements other than those specified in section 562.  Also, section 562
does not apply to proceedings under the FDIA, and it is not intended that
Section 562 have any impact on the interpretation of the provisions of the
FDIA relating to timing of damages in respect of QFCs or other contracts.

We do know which companies use the system.  I don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system.  My guess is that the only way to answer the question is for someone to sit down with the list of all customers and try and figure out which ones are utilities -- a less than perfect process but one that would give you a ballpark number.

Notwithstanding our discussion about customer lists yesterday, does EOL have a central repository of users that we can search to find the answer to this question?

How many other utilities buy or sell on our system?

Greg:  I wanted to make sure you knew about this.    I will continue to keep you in the loop on regulatory issues.   Best regards, Lisa
FERC rejected the request by PGE to modify the Code of Conduct so that they could buy on EnronOnline.  Basically, FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed.  

FERC found that There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                     
     represent prevailing market prices.
          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
     is willing to buy at.

FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file to fix the affiliate abuse.

As soon as we hear anything else, I'll let you know.

     Enron Power Marketing, Inc.                  Docket No. ER01-2103-000

ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE

                           (Issued July 20, 2001)

          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed
     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland
     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate
     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using
     the EnronOnline trading platform.

     I.   Background

          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in
     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000
     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-
     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through
     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication
     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on
     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on
                 1
     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing
     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which
     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the
     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there
     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to
     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower
     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous
     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,
     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their
     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make

               1
                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,
          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-
          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view
          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly
          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather
          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in
          buying from and selling power to third parties.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-
          and ER01-2103-000

     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions
     different than those in place but that, they state, will still
     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's
     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in
     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's
     requirement that "PGE post on its website notice of a potential
     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the
     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since
     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not
     provide for a waiting period before consummating the
                  2
     transaction."   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the
     ability to buy or sell power "from perhaps the largest marketer
                                                                3
     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers."

     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests

          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal
     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),
     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with
     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before
     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.

     III. Discussion

          The Commission allows power marketers and their public
     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates
     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate
     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can
     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers
     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at
     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers
     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the
     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization
     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate
                                                             4
     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.
     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are
     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various
     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent
                     5
     affiliate abuse.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-
          and ER01-2103-000

          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to
     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the
     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient
     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI
     using EnronOnline, will be required to "take the transaction
     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular
                                                              6
     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment."   In
                                                                  7
     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or
     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity
     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction
     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their
     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication
     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.

          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate
     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at

                EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5.
               7
                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would
          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or
          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While
          Applicants do not define "Limit Order," the common understanding
          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to
          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in
          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the
          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit
          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when
          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which
          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-
          and ER01-2103-000

     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market
     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI
     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is
     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be
     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,
     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.
     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by
     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of
     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted
     electronically and is available to all market participants,
     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to
     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and
     conditions that are available to PGE.

          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed
     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the
     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,
     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its
                                           8
     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of
     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse
     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for
     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps
     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an
     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and
     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's
     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline
                                        9
     represent prevailing market prices.

          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
                          10
     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media
     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be

               8
                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases
          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate
          power sales).
               9
                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.
               10
                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a
          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI
          is the buyer.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-
          and ER01-2103-000
                                                              11
     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.
     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product
     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be
     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via
     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-
     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically
     trade those products to attain similar benefits.

          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be
     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now
     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions
     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.
     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE
     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed
     restrictions that would require PGE to
     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate
     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with
     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same
     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its
     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or
     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.

          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited
     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from
     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,
     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-
     market prices.

          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal
     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline
     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's
     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for
     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,
     no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how
     unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would
     monitor inter-affiliate transactions.

          For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed
     amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their
     proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating
     appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.

               11
                 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and
          sell at higher prices.

          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6-
          and ER01-2103-000

     The Commission orders:

          Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected,

     without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

     By the Commission.

Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get away even close to on time?

Thanks again!

I'll let you guys decide who takes first crack at this one.

Mark, 

Attached is the EOL amend for Entergy-Koch (formerly Axia).  Janet has not seen this amendment either.

Stacy 

 

A spoon is a good start.  I think it's good as a cake frosting, as a filling between a couple of cookies, maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee?  In Buenos Aires I remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey -- goodness knows what they put it on.

So tell me....Exactly how do I eat the dulce de lece?  With a spoon?  Do I put it on other things?  Mix it in anything?  I don't want to waste any of it experimenting............

Sure - just send me the numbers -- or maybe a website or two.  We run the risk that when you show up it's a crappy boat but then we'll know better the next time.

Do you actually have to be in Woodstock to find a boat to charter for a sunset cruise?  Could I send you some phone numbers or something.  If you aren't going to arrive until Saturday, we could waste a lot of time driving around to boat yards on the Hudson.  I think we should have a sunset cruise for 6.

Sorry for the delay.  I will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Otherwise, how about Monday August 6 at 10:00, 2:00 or 3:00?

Mark,

Thank you very much for your e-mail I requested.  As it turns out I did not need it for Brad.

Brad did ask me to follow up on two items -- 

Item 1)  Brad was interested if we could share a list of people who visited the site.  So the users would obviously be a subset of this list.  Any thoughts on this matter?  If the customer visits would not work then --

Item 2)  Brad is interested in a workaround.  I shared the idea (at a high level) of a campaign to persuade the users to grant us permission to use their names. Brad wanted to be sure that several points would be addressed with whatever the workaround was.  His concerns are as follows: 1) we want to be as unobtrusive to the EOL customers as possible, 2) in any transaction we need to give the customer value, and 3)  the EOL customers would need to know how we would use the information if they did grant permission to share their data.

Suggested Action:

I would like to meet with you to talk further about any workarounds you might suggest which would address these issues.  After I have a clear understanding of your workaround which addresses the above issues I can then run it by Brad for his approval and then figure out who best to implement.

In this regards do you think we could meet tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. (in your office) for 30 minutes to discuss?  If this time is not convenient for you please counter with some times that are convenient to you.

Thank you 

Jake
  

Our agreements with EnronOnline customers prohibit us from sharing their names with third parties (i.e. non-Enron companies).  We can use our customer lists ourselves for marketing our products, but can not give the lists to anyone else.

Do you know anything about this?

Recently I have come into possession of copies of two (2) partially
executed documents between our companies, and I have been asked by my boss
to follow up to procure one (1) original of our Electronic Trading
Agreement and one (1) copy of our fully executed Password Application.

On January 3, 2000 our counsel, Elaine M. Walsh, both faxed and FedEx'd
three items to you--an EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement, Password
Application, and Customer Registration Form.  Again, if you would be so
kind as to forward one of the originals of the Trading Agreement and one
copy of the Password Application, I would greatly appreciate it.  If you
have, in fact, already returned an original to us way back when, I would be
grateful to receive a copy of this fully executed document.

Very many thanks.

Joel --

I've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives.  I'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you.

I am forwarding initial documents concerning an inventory finance transaction. 

Mark, I am distributing to your attention since the structure involves the buying/selling of inventory in a trading arrangement, and the documents are in some respects derived from an ISDA format. While this is a "financing" with a bank, and hence my involvement, there are trading aspects here as well. [Mike Robison is reviewing from the EWS business unit perspective.]If someone in your group should review, please advise.

Justin, I am distributing to your attention, since the choice of law is English, and you were involved in the prior Metals transaction that this is derived from. If someone else in London should review, please advise.

Please find attached first drafts of:

1 the Master Agreement;
2 the Forward Sale Agreement; and
3 the Agency Agreement.

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>>  <<010702_Forward_Sale_Agreemnt_DES.doc>>  
<<010702_DES_EnronAgencyAgreement.doc>> 

For ease of review, I also attach:

1 the Master Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>> 

2 the Forward Sale Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical
metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); and

 <<REVISED3.DOC>> 

3 the Agency Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<PhysMstrvAgency.doc>> 

Please note the following:

1. General

- I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in
the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to
ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements
of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of
Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate
side letter. 
- To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this
transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master
Agreement.
- These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject
to their comments.

2. Master Agreement

- As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the
concepts of "Reference Price" and "Pricing Date", which are similar to those
contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions.
- Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call
Options on non-Business Days.
- I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the
Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that
does remain in the Master Agreement is that of "Agency Costs", which is, in
some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be
discussed.
- I have removed the concept of "Minimum Value", which I understand will not
form part of this transaction.
- I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an
imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences
of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this
(see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5).

3. Forward Sale Agreement

- I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the
Agency and the Master Agreements.
- The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed.
- I have removed "Credit Support Default" as an Event of Default.

4. Agency Agreement

- As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make
this agreement as distinct as possible.

I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this
transaction.

Kind regards

Here's another which Janet hasn't seen yet.

Mark, 

Attached is the EOL amendment for Dynegy.  Janet is on vacation until next week.  She has not seen this amendment.

Stacy

  

I didn't see your name in any of these e-mails.  Do you get involved in Trade Commission issues?

   The attached is a request that we received from the U.S. Trade Commission in connection with the pending 201 proceeding. We need to coordinate a response. Please review and I will coordinate a meeting to discuss.   Thanks,   Julia

as per phonecall...

Let's discuss
Greg

Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

The project for converting our Lotus Notes database to Oracle is now underway.  The technical people need a list of the upgrades we want as soon as possible.  Tana will be stopping by within the next few days to solicit your input.  Please give this some thought now so that you can be ready with suggestions for her.

Hi Justin -- I'm afraid I don't really know what this is all about.  It sounds like it might be something the tax people should be doing.  Can you fill me in? 

Hi Mark

I wonder whether you could pass this on to one of your guys (maybe mark greenberg, or whowever drafted the EOL cost sharing agreement)

many thanks

j

Justin - did the below by in document ever get drafted.  If so can I have a copy for my files.
If not - what is the status?
Regards
Jason

jason.  in response:

thanks

justin

Justin,

When we last met you were going to look at a couple of for things for me, these were:

1 - Who is the legally owner of all residual rights attaching to EOL intangible? and
2 - What documentation is need to introduce a buy in participant to the agreement and then draft such document.

Could you let me know the status of both these items.  FYI - the items are needed for the US tax return (which cannot be filed without them) which is being filed in the next week or so. Accordingly, we need to execute and send to US for inclusion before this deadline - ideally I would like to do early next week.

Thanks for your help on this one.
Regards
Jason 

Mark, per our conversations, please forward this to Kate Cole to show your approval.

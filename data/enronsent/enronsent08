no partnering in the project. There has been no serious negotiation on this 
to date and I don't want Scott to waste his time if we really don't have the 
turbine from EE&CC. Please advise. Thanks.

Sent by: Lisa Zarsky
Per our telephone conversation today, I have been asked by two Cogentrix 
executives if we have any General Electric 7FA turbines (for delivery in 
2002) available for sale. I believe that Cogentrix needs the turbine for one 
of the combined cycle projects it has been permitting in Entergy or TVA. They 
seen somewhat anxious.

As we discussed, I will let Cogentrix know about the availability of the two 
General Electric 7EA's and the two Westinghouse 501-D's. What about the 7FA 
that Dave Delainey loaned to EE&CC, could this turbine be available for sale 
to Cogentrix?

How could coal fired QF's play into your and George's strategy?

In response to your e mail, this is meant to update you on the status of the 
search for potential coal fired generation sites.

We have used the following criteria to screen potential sites east of the 
Mississippi including the following:

 Underutilized existing coal fired generation (15 sites)
 Existing coal fired generation that is on cold stand by (12 sites)
 Coal units that have been retired (20 sites)
 Coal fired units that at one time had planned coal unit additions that were 
delayed or cancelled (11 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build coal units (13 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build nuclear units (5 sites)

We are in the process of prioritizing each site based on infrastructure, 
transmission access, market and permit status. That effort should be 
concluded this week and the study forwarded to you. We are also talking with 
two coal operators that are in the process of developing their own coal fired 
generation in Kentucky and West Virginia.

We will keep you apprised of the progress and meet with you again as we move 
to the next stage. 

Rob, thanks for the update - I am assuming that you will come up with $23M 
Cdn ($16M USD) - "highly likely" with PML.  We do not have recorded in the 
financial statements the $8M Cdn in done deals - you may want to look into 
that.  

We need the money to show up given every other Enron group is flaking - bail 
me out my friend!

Dave, Origination & Finance has booked roughly C$8MM Quarter to Date.  

For the remainder of the quarter, I will attempt to give you a break-down 
based on probability:

"Highly Likely"
Done Deals    C$8MM
Papier Masson Service Fee Income C$1MM
PCOG Strategic Alliance Extension C$2MM
Chippawa Capacity Assignment  C$1MM
Misc. Marketing Deals   C$1MM
Total     C$13MM

"Probable"
Papier Masson Write-up/Monetization C$10MM (ECC's share only)
MAP Auction    C$2MM
Blue Range Final Dividend  C$1MM
Calpine Capacity Assignment  C$2MM (ECC's share only)
Total     C$15MM

"Unclear"
Tax Mitigation    C$10MM
Turbine Sale    C$2MM
Clarica Funding Deal for PPA  C$1MM
Total     C$13MM

Papier Masson is proceding nicely,as the owners have agreed to sell the asset 
. The owners have also agreed to a structure in principle, whereby they have 
determined a range that they are willing to sell at. If enron exceeds the 
range, they are bound to sell it to Houston P&P group. If we bid inside the 
range they then have 8 weeks to shop us, and if they dont receive any offers, 
enron buys the mill at our bid less C$5MM. If they shop us and receive a 
third party offer, they pay enron a break fee of C$5MM. If they close with a 
third party, we receive an additional C$10MM. At a minimum, this provides us 
with a fair market valuation by an independent/outside party that we can use 
as our basis for writing up the asset. Secondly, it allows the P&P group to 
bid without being a stalking horse as it provides for hefty break fees and 
significant earnings on closing. 

With regards to tax mitigation, I will have a better idea by the end of this 
week. The tax guys are up from Houston and we will be working on it the 
remainder of the week.

fyi...British Energy is now worth >C$100MM at the desk's bid. We are still 
working toward a May 1, 2001 market opening. Support for a may 1 start is 
mounting and has become a very public topic consistently referring to May 1.

11/28/2000 01:05 PM
Rob, can you give me a view on where you stand for fourth quarter from an 
orig point of view ie) deals and value.

Regards
Delainey

George, it is probably worth  speaking to them about the US assets - probably 
the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great 
brownfield sites. I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired 
assets. I would speak to Sherriff on that one. However, I would caution that 
real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on 
Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.  

For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based 
on gas being on the margin.  Now that was before a lot of the run up so it 
may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.  
As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not 
sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a 
Wall Street point of view.  

We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia 
assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's 
point of view..

Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger 
part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us 
from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view.  
Have we looked at this?  Are there many in the market?

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Dave - as we know Mission is under pressure with regards to the poor 
performance of their non-regulated generation assets in the US and UK.  It 
appears their  UK coal fired assets (Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge) are for 
sale.  We should consider contacting them to determine their interest to 
divest any part of their US generation asset portfolio as well.

EME owns the former Comed coal and gas fired assets in Chicago, and Homer 
City in Pa.  In addition they have small coal fired generation assets in West 
Virginia and Virginia.  It may be possible to pick up one or more coal fired 
generation assets from Mission, and expand their existing capacity.

We are continuing to work on identifying brown field coal fired sites.  This 
may be another approach to pursue as well.  

Let me know if you think we need to work EME.  Thanks.

Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation 
of approximately $39 M.  Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of 
value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your 
continued management.

Let me know where you end up.

Regards
Delainey

Jeff, I don't believe the offer I showed you of $39 M is unreasonable. In 
fact the team had recommended $42 M based on a number of measures.  I see the 
6X multiple of annualized Q2 earnings as one of the best measures of the 
potential value of this company.

I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below 
a reasonable market value between business units.  You can trust that I will 
be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the 
realization of this value if you do not purchase the company.

If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value, I will 
support that transaction.

Regards
Delainey

Jeffrey Sherrick@ENRON
07/13/2000 07:17 PM
Dave,  I have ask Steve Harper, Jack Harmuth, Howard Selzer,and  Glenn Fox to 
work with Steve Pruitt and see if the number you offered can be supported.  
The value for proved developed reserves and the financial/legal issues can be 
reviewed rather painlessly here in Houston.  The value for the  proved 
undeveloped reserves will most likely require a visit to the working team to 
see the program particulars, verify the acreage and , concluded the validity 
of this estimate of PUD value.  The idea of paying before tax NPV10% for an 
assumed 3.5 year program on top of the PD &PUD reserves will require a more 
indepth review.  

Obviously, we want to do this as simply as possible and I was prepared to 
take the package "as is, where is" at book value which I understood to be in 
the 30-32MM$ range including debt.  Dave I understand what you are doing and 
I would support this effort if we were selling the asset outside of the 
company.   I want to do what is best for Enron at this time which I believe 
is to transfer this asset to EGEP for the reasons i outlined in my prior 
memo.  It will benefit C-gas via direct access to technology and specialists, 
it will benefit EGEP for marketing and a US presence and it will benefit ENA 
by moving the asset from your books without a loss and releasing the valuable 
intellectual capital ENA could employ elsewhere in a higher yielding business 
venture.  However, with the premiums you have placed on the properties it is 
going to be very difficult to make this transaction happen.  (However, we are 
willing to try)  ENA has had this on the market for over a year with the 
intent to sell it at book if possible.  Prices have improved, but I believe 
even your team would admit this is still a project to get book in the market 
today.  Your estimated value at the current strip at a Before Tax 10% 
discount for Appalachian reserves seems a little aggressive for the market 
let alone an inter-company transfer.  

When we talked about this a couple of weeks ago we said it would be a fair 
transaction and at the time you were hedging that it would be around book.  I 
understood your logic for needing to talk with your team but I was relying on 
a fair deal to result.  Dave, I'm only sending this memo to you because I 
feel this is being pushed way past fair by your team with the intent that if 
we pay this it is a home run for your new team and since we are in a bind, 
let's see what happens.  I know this is a very small piece of business for 
you and the time it takes to read this is more than you can afford to this 
asset or transaction.  If fact,  the easy thing for you to do is get mad and 
say you don't have the time and stop the transaction.  On the other hand, if 
you believe the right thing for all parties is to do this at book, say so and 
you'll never deal with this piece of business again.  I hope in this case you 
will put the greater good of Enron in front of ENA's desire to hit a home run 
at EGEP's expense and in the spirit of ONE-ENRON move these assets to EGEP at 
book value.  
As I said in the beginning we will try to get to your number, but I am 
concerned that we will spend a lot of time and require effort from all of the 
teams that could be eliminated if you and I decided to make this transaction 
at book.  In fact, it would be the easiest transition for the C-Gas team 
which you've indicated to be a concern for your team.  I am available through 
voice mail and I can get my lotus notes most days.  Best thing is to leave a 
voice mail and a good time for me to call you back.

Thanks Dave for your time,
Jeff

Lou, are there concerns that I am not aware?  From an economic point of view, 
it is clearly not in our interest to aggregate residential or small customers 
who have retail choice; however, standard office service (like the UI deal) 
is clearly a customized, wholesale/all -requirements sale of significant size 
negotiated with the utility and the puc.

ENA Mid-Year 2000 Senior Management and High Value Contributors Equity Awards

Mary,

As discussed yesterday, I have had further discussions with Dave and John on 
this subject and we would like to proceed as follows;

- Wait for mid-year PRC discussions to conclude July 7
- Make recommendations for option grants to key first 6 month contributors 
and new management players following week
- Strike equity and communicate to recipients Aug 1

The rationale for this would be as follows:

- ENA has had a stellar first 6 months and will probably over exceed plan by 
$150mm
- 5 or 6 individuals have been instrumental in creating exceptional value and 
we would like to recognise their performance now.
- A number of people have over the last 6 months been asked to step up and 
take more senior roles following the moves to EBS and ENW. We would like to 
recognise these people now (subject to top 2 PRC performance) by granting 
them some options.
- As a consequence of some people's increased responsibilities and in looking 
at their unvested equity value, a number of people appear low in relation to 
the market.

I would anticipate that the individual awards would be of 7 year options with 
standard vesting and would mainly be of individual 5-10,000 options awards 
(or $145-$290k). These might total in the region of 150-250,000 options.

While most of the probable recipients will be commercial officers, I would 
expect a number of senior support and some Commercial Directors also to be 
recommended.

Obviously I understand that we will need to put individual cases together for 
each recipient for board submission but I would appreciate your help and 
guidance as we proceed. In particular please alert me asap if you think this 
will be a problem.

Thanks

David

David:

I met with you last December/January in connection with working for Enron.
At that time Enron made me an offer to work in your group.  I made the
decision to not accept the offer.  The main reason was that I could not
digest the concept of leaving BP Amoco less than six months after I had
joined them.

I am still with BP Amoco and they continue to treat me real well.  At the
same time, I now realize that I made  a stupid mistake in turning down the
Enron offer.  If you are willing to reconsider, I would love to talk to you.
Considering what I put you through the last time, if you do not want to
reconsider, I can understand.

David, I would appreciate it I can meet with you in person to discuss this
further with you.  If you are okay with it, can I buy you lunch and talk
about this.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Ray, couple of comments:
 a) Donahue is responsible for the portfolio management function but also 
incorporate the idea of Jeff being responsible for ENA's "capital book" (ie) 
managing existing deals and intimately involved in conjunction with Treasury 
and the various origination groups of which finance transactions get or don't 
get on our books;
 b) Has Fastow clearly put Defner in the ENA Treasurer role? - if so we 
should also mention this in the note;
 c) Chuck Ward ( Generation Investments); Don Miller ( Merchant Generation);
 and d) with regard to commodity structuring ensure it is clear that they 
will facilitate and structure the highest priority/value transactions across 
the organization even though they report to Janet (ie) they don't just work 
on East Origination deals.

Let me see the final before release. Make sure Mark is on side.

Hat's off to the group for a very successful quarter for MEH.  I graciously 
commend everyone for the teamwork and perseverance displayed in tackling the 
array of transactions and tasks to ensure the successful start of our new 
joint business.  We continue to have many challenges ahead, but I wanted to 
take pause and in particular commend the following:

Trunkline Transaction Team - Roy Rodriguez, Russell Murrell, and Steve Curlee 
brought to closure a significant transaction with leveraged off many groups 
in the PEC and Enron organizations.  Net transaction mark to market on behalf 
of MEH was $2,286,634  with accrual and option values to be realized over the 
3 year term of the arrangement.  Team work permeated this transaction and 
thanks are due to 1) legal teams for PEC led by Mary Klyasheff and for ENA 
led by Sheila Tweed and Jeff Hodge 2) structuring group support from Steve 
Curlee,  Deirdre McCaffrey and Ed McMichael 3) Tony Compton for the 
successful closure of gas supply transactions with third parties 4) to all 
else who covered the many transaction closing issues and bookings. 
NSS and NGPL Capacity Transaction Team - Steve Richman, Roy Rodriguez, 
Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard and Lee Fascetti successfully proposed, 
negotiated and are now managing a 3 year storage and capacity management of 
approximately 18 BCF/year of NGPL no-notice storage and accompanying 
transportation with realized value year to date for MEH of $1,510,459  with 
an additional $1,541,835  of value to PGL ratepayers.  This transaction will 
continue to be a significant asset to leverage into the intra-day market  and 
our initial platform for on-line business (EOL).
Daily Optimization - Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard, Steve Richman, Tim 
Hermann, Cary Carrabine and Lee Fascetti , diligently pursued and completed 
other significant transactions for MEH totalling $1,252,584 for this 
quarter.  Richard Tomaski and Kevin Radous have spent endless amounts of time 
(and evenings/weekends) to ensure that MEH had a P&L to represent for the 
groups hard work and my many thanks extend to both.
Business Set-up - Tim Hermann, Roy Rodriguez, Paul Burgener, Gregg Penman, 
Kevin Radous, Richard Tomaksi, and Barbara Dillard have toiled diligently and 
continue to proceed in contracts/policy and procedures between PEC/ENA/PGL 
and third parties. Additional thanks are due to all groups within accounting, 
economics, and trading within PEC and ENA in support of this new business and 
we ask for your continued engagement.

Over the next month, we must get closure on the remaining requirements of 
running a tightly managed and successful business venture.  We must continue 
to take our ideas and strategies to financially successful commercial 
operation .  Momentum is now on our side...

Thanx,

Laura

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its "Safety First" culture and track
record of commercial success.

I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we 
enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or 
course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation 
site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally 
and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with 
Phillippe or do anything else?

=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. "It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices."
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  "The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot," said
the
Raymond James report. "Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise."
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  "Coal will not go away," said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
"The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap."
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  "You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years," he predicted. "In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes."
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  "If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on," said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is "very possible."
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a "transport reactor," a device based on
existing technology used to "crack" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  "The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices," said Goodman. "At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu."

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  "The $64 question is the price of gas," said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

Ronnie and Russell,

Attached find a revised financial model for the Doyle project.  The model 
contains the changes that have occurred since this model was last updated in 
the Fall of 1999.  While the model is lengthy, I will summarize the major 
differences in the project.

1).  Capital Cost Increases:

The project capital cost has increased from the original plan.  The increases 
are dur to the following changes from our initial budget:

a) Planned purchase of the neighbor's house  $   140,000
b) Added cost of the sewer line    $      59,000
c) Output bonus on the PDA for max 5 MW   $1,725,000
d) IDC increase from increase in interest rates  $   574,000
 Total       $2,498,000

2).  Total Output change from 342 MW to 351.6 MW.  This assumes that unit 1 
will test at 62.2 MW. (the same as units 2 & 3)

3).  Project Net Value Increases due to Output Increase:

Impact of the added plant output is very positive.  It increases cashflow and 
debt service coverage.  The net increase to Walton is an additional 
$2,568,000 in value.  Walton's NPV increased from $5,281,000 to $7,849,000.  
This NPV includes Walton's project returns, the cost of interest on equity, 
the cost and recovery of LTCTs, and the asset management fee.

If you have any question, please call.

EE&CC has forwarded the peaker fee ($9.1 MM) invoice to ENA (see at bottom).  
I have sent a return e-mail to Gavin Gaul and John Normand explaining that 
final approval of this invoice will be from you.  Amy and I are waiting for a 
better breakdown of overhead charges on acceleration change orders.  Once we 
have the overhead issue framed out, I would then battle the fee, especially 
on Wilton Center, on a packaged basis with the overhead charges.

As per the Wilton Center fee, I reviewed all of the e-mail rhetoric regarding 
who is to blame for the massive construction cost overruns.  EECC/NEPCO's 
cupbability lies in their insistance from day one that Wilton Center could 
and would be built non-union.  It was only after ENA forced the decision in 
late June 1999 to build the job union (to avoid air permit intervention) that 
EECC/NEPCO even began to deal with how to build the job in a union 
environment.  Even at that point, EECC/NEPCO would not move off of building 
the job on a cost reimbursable basis and did not properly consider other 
alternatives such as fixed unit pricing (fixed price per unit quantity 
installed).  EECC/NEPCO claimed that they did not have enough time to 
negotiate with the unionsor pursue other options.  However, because of their 
insistance to go non-union, they precluded the ability to negotiate until the 
decision to go union was made.  According to our labor experts, breaking off 
union site negotiations and building non-union is worse than just going 
non-union from the start.  In any event, if you need more detail on this 
subject prior to discussing the fee with Larry Izzo, please let me know and I 
will summarize the key points.

I will continue to work with Amy Spoede to tie down the remaining cost and 
overhead issues.  If you need me to do anything else, please let me know.

Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a 
list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a 
definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could 
be acted upon.

 a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.;
 b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day 
and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.;
 c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 
5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.;
 d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel "header" - Jean M.;
 e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and 
contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.;
 f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - 
working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al 
- Patrick   W.
 
 I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to 
determine a final action plan.

Regards
Delainey
 

Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Guys, there is quite a number of us dealing with this problem - what are our 
solutions?

Could we have a corporate jet available for folks stuck in the A&A PRC? Other?

Regards
Delainey

Sorry that my arrangements with Jana G. in the Associates Program to change 
the date of the Associates PRC were over-ruled by Charlene.  I had agreed 
with Jana that swapping the dates of the Analysts and Associates PRC meetings 
was a great solution.  Despite the fact that the program had not checked with 
us as PRC reps to see if December 13 was a convenient date, Charlene 
developed an interesting concern over potentially inconveniencing the 
directors who are PRC reps for the Analyst PRC.  And I see that you were 
drafted into facilitating the whole meeting!  

I am scheduled on the 5:35 flight from IAH to Las Vegas on the afternoon of 
the 13th.  I would have to leave downtown by 4:15 to make that flight.  I 
have been asked to confirm those flight arrangements so that a ticket can be 
issued.  Since you will be in charge, will this flight time work?  --Sally 

Scott, sounds great!! Can't wait for the next one.

Mary, I'm just curious why you need that info but it is 0 outside Enron comp

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   

Thanks,

Dave

Jim, I agree - lets put a plan in place to ensure appropriate representation 
at these ISO's (not unlike PAC) and ensure that FERC is not abdicating their 
responsibilities.

The three of us probably need to get together and discuss tactics around a 
number of issues.  

Jim, I am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your 
new role.

Delainey
James D Steffes@EES

Dave --

To your direct question of should Enron take a more active role in supporting 
or nominating Board members, I agree fully.

I would add the following thoughts:

First, I think that Enron's key position in terms of ISO / RTO governance 
should be that Boards (or the leadership and staff of transmission providers) 
should be indifferent to the price at which the commodity trades.  ISOs and 
RTOs should only worry about transmission, not the price of the commodity 
they are transmitting.   Winning on this issue will be critical as RTOs are 
proposed throughout the country to meet Order 2000 obligations.   

Also, Enron needs to really go after FERC for abdicating its wholesale market 
authority to ISOs, especially ISOs like in California that are dominated by 
state political figures.  FERC is responsible for ensuring just and 
reasonable rates, not some stakeholder Board established by state 
legislation.  We need to argue strongly that FERC must take back this 
authority in the near term and utilize its administrative procedures to 
impose any market changes.  

Finally, given that it will be some period of time before there is truly a 
"financially indifferent" transmission provider under Order 2000, Enron must 
take an active role in working within and through the Boards of the current 
ISOs.   A good example is the way that Dan Allegretti works within the 
NE-ISO.  These Boards and the ISOs are fundamentally political 
organizations.  Our representatives must take the time to get to know the 
people so that when key issues arise, we are able to influence the decisions.

Thanks, 

Jim

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we 
managed the position in a very effective manner.

Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a 
necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, 
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors 
on these boards?

Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti 
is putting plan in place.

FYI, the DeAcero PPA was signed by David Gutierrez this evening.  Thanks to 
each of you for all of the hard work and creativity so far - it's been a 
pleasure working with this team and I look forward to continuing to do so as 
we fill up the rest of the interconnect.

Best regards - Max

Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as 
the example to use in other groups.  It can wait until you have it all 
completed.  You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies 
have you brought on-line, etc.

 summary:
  - coverage metrics;
  - market iniatives;
  - completed deals;
  - hot list;
  - EOL metrics.

Thxs
Delainey
 
	
	

Dave:

I want to be sure I am on the right track for providing you ,John and Kevin 
with meaningful account coverage data. I envision a one page 
summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage 
ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set 
at 100%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards 
would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially 
active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at 
least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose 
product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each 
commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.  I will 
derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates 
and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master 
list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list 
quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed 
coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?

In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business 
plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will be
identification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy 
Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I 
don't want to provide you with something "half-baked".  Is it acceptable to 
allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provide
you with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ? 

Finally, I have provided Tammy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed 
transactions plus a deal flow "hot list" .

Sorry for being verbose. Please advise. 

Thanks,     Ed

Nella, sorry to see you go; however, best of luck in all your future

It is with great regret that I announce that Nella has resigned from Enron 
Canada effective July 14th.  Nella has been with Enron Canada for 61/2 years, 
including many of the formative years.  

Nella has been an extraordinarily valuable asset to Enron Canada and she will 
be greatly missed.  Frankly, for all Nella has done for Enron Canada, and the 
dedication, commitment and sincerity with which she has done it, she cannot 
be replaced.  Nella has been instrumental in the development and ongoing 
maintenance and administration of our contracting forms, precedent systems, 
confirmation letters, contracting files, contract diarization and data base 
systems,  and has had significant input on the development and/or 
implementation of key corporate and managerial policies and controls.  

More importantly, Nella always appreciated that, because of the nature of our 
business, our core assets are our contractual rights, and with much personal 
commitment, and often at much personal expense, Nella always endeavored to 
ensure that things not only got done, but that they got done properly and 
punctually.  I know that Linda, Greg, Mark and I (and many of you) will 
discover aspects of our jobs which we did not know existed because they were 
so capably and quietly looked after by Nella.

Most importantly, Nella had great personal commitment to do all she could 
within the limits of available resources to help us achieve our personal 
objectives at Enron Canada, whether or not realistic.  Many of us, in many 
cases without even knowing it, could not have achieved many of our own 
individual accomplishments at Enron Canada without Nella's commitment and 
dedication.

Nella will be missed, and I ask you to bear with us as we continue to try 
meet your requests until we are able to hire a suitable replacement.

Regards, Peter.

Don, in my opinion options 1 & 2 are the same and 3 is not an option.  I 
would like to provide an outsourcing deal that earns us fees and provides 
information.  We will manage the internal issues.  A properly priced and 
scoped term outsourcing deal should be doable.  Please speak with Sally Beck 
and Beth Perleman.

Dave,

We had a good meeting with Presto today.  We came away with a broad T&M 
outline.  One concern that Kevin raised is our ability to actually do a 
"services agreement" for the risk management and back offices aspect of 
NewCo.  Apparently, he said a number of issues have bubbled up recently with 
our systems in terms of manpower, age of system, and ability to take on 
additional load.  He said throwing on an incremental 4000-5000 MWs with NewCo 
may prove to be too much to handle.  He also raised the "confidentiality 
issue".  It is his view that NewCo should have this capability in-house 
anyway (obviously that was always the long term intent, with this services 
agreement more a bridge).

Several options exist.
1.  Force a 12-24 month services agreement through the system (solve our 
problems with more people, etc).

2.  Agree to set up NewCo's system using our unique expertise and experience. 
We would do this for a fee (say $15MM?).   One issue here is just NewCo's 
ability to get this done in conjunction with everything else in time to do 
IPO.

3. Investigate what type of system FPLe is using today.  Since we are not 
increasing net merchant MWs on day 1, FPLe's system could serve as the 
platform for future MW expansion.  Maybe Enron comes in and expands/redesigns 
system for a fee?  I believe that FPLe has just recently expanded/updated 
their system.  I would like to try to learn more about their system.

Let me know if you have a preference or any additional thoughts.  I think we 
can make money off of all three options.

Thanks,

Don

Please clarify -  I think you were a few million off on the Upstream Plan 
#.   Per the weekly earnings estimate my gross margin plan numbers are as 
follows:

    Q2 Plan  
Upstream Origination  $18.423  
HPL (non Texas Trading) $10.746
LRC    $   1.690
    $30.859

Guys, we are getting close to completing the quarter, the following gross 
margin is expected from each of these groups before the end of the week.  If 
there is any issue of any type please give me or Wes a call. If there are any 
upsides to these numbers please let us know as well.

 East Origination  $1.000 M
 West Origination $9.086 M (inclusive of all QF fair value)
 Industrial (incl trading) $12.899 M
 Generation Invest $45.350 M (including fair value and accretion on ECP)
 ENA Upstream  $41.112 M (including Sithe earnings plus HPL, LRC and upstream 
origination)
 Coal   $4.161 M
 Canada  $11.50 M
 
 Equity Portfolio  Current MPR for quarter ($26.786M) (large positions - 
moves with market)
    plus an additional writedown of ($279K) equivalent to $27.5 M less ECP 
and West QF earnings listed above minus $10M.

  I have you down for a firm incremental $3.875 M net to Enron.

Dave, yes, I have upside on this week's East Midstream earnings.  Here's how 
it looks right now:

Great River Energy  $  875,000
Keyspan split              $4,000,000
Chicago Hub               $3,000,000
                                         ----------------
Total              $7,875,000

Yes, these earnings are real. GRE will be booked tomorrow (Ozzie is signing 
the contracts tonight), and Keyspan dollars will be finalized on Thursday. 
Chicago is really moving now. The Trunkline capacity is being executed today 
and tomorrow and will be booked tomorrow (@ $1,500,000 net to ENA), we traded 
out of 15 BCF of a storage hedge with the Utility and will recognize about 
$1,000,000 net to ENA tomorrow, and will take @ $500,000 to earnings from 
numerous other deals later this week. Let me know if you wish to discuss!!

Sorry about the confusion.  Fran Mayes will be sending a memo out in the next 
day or so reflecting the times of the PRC.  In order to accommodate Dave's 
meeting with all you and to include Mark Frevert we had to move the time of 
the PRC from 8:00 am to 11:00 am.  The ONLY thing changed was the time,
the date and place remain the same.

Again, I am sorry for the confusion and I hope this helps.  If you have any 
question, please feel free to call me.

Thanks,

Kay

Greg, it is really up to you - if you have other things to do don't worry 
about it.  

Regards
Delainey

Fran was the one asking me to go to the ENA Final VP PRC on the 7th since I 
had a few months of data on Rodney, Edward, Ajello and Burnett.  Also, Rodney 
and Edward were hoping I could attend ( I guess they think my attendance 
would help them not hurt them!).  I can attend if you want and give my Q1 
observations.  However, if you think you have it handled, that is OK for me 
as well.  I am not emotional about it either way and am only concerned about 
helping if you need it or want it.  That is why Kay asked you about it today.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.

Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with 
Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the 
aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months 
ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are 
expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention 
significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the 
$600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve 
growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to 
demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and 
reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a 
significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The 
concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a 
very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable 
strategy to maximize the exit value).

I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:
 a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and
 b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.

Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to 
sell tha asset.

I hope this meets with your approval.

We spent three days meeting with the FPL guys last week.  The meetings were 
productive, and we are making progress.  Lew has instructed these guys to get 
down into a lot of detail on the business plan/core competencies, which we 
did!

They also floated the valuation of their existing assets - $3.1B for 3947 MWs 
or $789/kW.  We walked them through our peaker valuation as well.  We didn't 
debate the valuations, but rather we decided to go ahead and have Clement and 
Jinsung try to pull together a consolidated model for NewCo.  That is being 
done, and should be ready Monday/Tuesday. 

It is apparent from these meetings that they are looking for ENRON to provide 
several key pieces to NewCo (other than peakers and dev. projects):

1. Enron culture and emphasis on intellectual capital (including HR approach).
2. Trading and marketing expertise.
3. Enron style finance.
4. Select management spots.
5. Supplement development team.

The interesting debate is how we get compensated for the significant impact 
that the Enron "halo" is going to have on NewCo's IPO ( particularly if we 
deliver the items listed above).  I raised this incremental value issue with 
them.

FPL's key pieces include:

1. Core "operating" competencies and asset management techniques.
2. Construction management techniques.
3.  Select management spots.
4.  National development team.

The FPL risk in this whole exercise is if Lew is unsuccessful in convincing 
Broadhead that owning some % of NewCo is not a better value proposition that 
owning 100% on FPLE; and/or the decision to wait until Florida deregulates 
before spinning out FPLE.  Glenn Smith stopped by last week and he 
highlighted these issues as well.

We have a lot of work to do this week including a need to determine Trading & 
Marketing model; develop potential services agreements (QF, back office); 
refine our financial model and expand to include new projects, turbine capx, 
etc.; expand development framework;  pull pitch together to float NewCo by 
investment bank, etc.....

I am happy to expand on exactly where we stand with FPL.  I guess we also 
need to think about staffing if both Cinergy and FPL move forward (let's just 
sell the peakers to Cinergy for $1.25B and let them do their own IPO).

Don

I really hate to bother you with this, but anything you can do to get these 
guys off the dime and moving (rather than complaining) would be appreciated. 
I called Westfahl as you suggested, but he never responded. At the end of the 
day, I think maybe the board approval we were talking about (Moore, Florida 
and Louisiana) is the only way to send the message. 

One highlight of interest in Coleman's e-mail is that it takes longer than 7 
months to construct a 6 - LM6000 plant. That's pretty amazing given that 
NEPCO just finished constructing four ENA plants (Gleason, Wheatland, Wilton

Anything you can do (or any advice) would be appreciated. Right now I'm

Ben,

Reflecting on our conversation at lunch the other day, I want to re-emphasize 
my concerns about the schedule issues.  You indicated that you had an idea 
that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 
months.  This is not at all realistic.  I would expect that the most 
aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired 
LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two 
weeks for each additional unit.  This would result in an installation 
duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.  In front 
of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work 
done.

The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling 
requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of 
this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental 
installation time per unit somewhat.  Considering these factors, it would not 
be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer.  

I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.  But I think 
that this is real world.  For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean 
getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. 

You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for 
Florida.  If this is correct then there is a serious disconnect for your 
schedule.  We need to make all efforts to expedite the on site date if June 
01 commercial operations is to be achieved.

Let's talk.

Mike

Dave, I didnt get a chance to talk to you during your meeting but thought I 
should make you aware of the following. Unfortunately, we have experienced a 
bit of a set-back re Ontario market opening. As you know, the market was 
scheduled to open November 1,2000. We had anticipated somewhat of a delay and 
had forecasted a Feb 1, 2001 start. This week the Minister of Energy 
announced that market opening would be delayed "about 6 months". This of 
course is very dissppointing to us and Aleck Dadson is working hard with the 
Ministry and other interested parties in shoring up a date with a tighter 
time frame.

The reason for the delay is primarily due to the lack of readiness on behalf 
of the IMO. This is a frustrating situation for the minister and as such he 
has moved to appoint myself to the IMO Board. It should be noted that the 
Minister did not accept the IMO's board recommendation but unilaterally went 
with me. He was intent on appointing someone who had goal alignment re 
opening this market asap. This goes a long way in illustrating the great job 
our regulatory group (Aleck Dadson) has done/is doing  in 
positioning/developing credibility with the Ministry of Energy.   

I know that you had concerns re time commitment but I believe strongly that 
Enron needs a voice at the IMO Board as this is a critical point in time to 
shape this marketplace.

Regards
Milnthorp

Bob, I know that you made this work !!  This recovery plan is exceptional.

Wes, expense the amortization to Office of the Chairman not West Power or 
Origination.

Regards
Delainey
I try to run clean, conservative books.  To that end, I assessed every single 
originated transaciton when I took over the group in 1999.  Edith Cross and I 
turned over every rock that we could find, booked things properly, and moved 
on.  I know nothing about this amortization that's been going on.  Perhaps 
there were two payments to Fort James -- one being the payment that west 
power trading expensed in 1997 associated with the in money Wauna/Halsey 
position and the other associated with the overall alliance.  West Power 
Trading very clearly liquidated the payment associated with Wauna/Halsey in 
1997.  I have the DPR from March of 1997 to prove it.  If this payment was 
capitalized for some reason after West Power Trading expensed it, then I'm 
not sure what to do.  It seems odd for us to pay for the same bad position 
twice.  

If the amortization is associated with the second payment to Fort James -- 
the alliance payment -- then we have a different kettle of fish entirely.  I 
don't understand why it was ok for the amotization to hit the industrial 
group but when we do a one-time amortization of the balance it all of a 
sudden switches over to the West Power Trading group.  How come last month it 
was "proper" for the charge to hit the industrial group and this month it is 
"proper" for the charge to hit West Power Trading.  The charge should hit 
whoever's rc it was who thought that paying Fort James a bunch of money was a 
good idea.  If that person is no longer around the charge should either hit 
that person's successor or it should hit a management book.

To your point about who benefits from the termination of this deal.  Clearly, 
it is a good idea to terminate these deals and remove bad positions with a 
lot of uncertainty from the West Power Trading books.  Having said that, I 
have a hard time feeling good about the "benefit" that West Power Trading has 
received from these deals.  In 1999 I was told that this was largely a legal 
question.  A memo written by Jake Thomas on April 7, 1999 memorializes this 
line of thought.  We established a $500k legal reserve, rebooked the deals, 
took most of the positive value to the book to offset large losses associated 
with other old deals and granted the remainder, about $1 million, to Jake in 
origination.  The entity that has benefited the most from these deals is West 
Origination.

Finally, I can't see how this expense belongs to West Power Trading.  I would 
like to understand how all of the accounting worked before I can accept an 
expense on my rc.  If you want to deal with the expense separately and have a 
discussion about granting origination for terminating this deal then let's do 
that.  That discussion needs to reflect history, and include the origination 
that was granted in 1997, 1999, and include the legal reserve of $500k.

Give me a call when you get a chance.

Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized 
for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville 
and Ondarza).  As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement 
involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and 
Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding 
that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland 
shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the 
lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical 
to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as 
a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent 
liability.

Lets discuss.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Edith Cross and I looked at the Fort James deal in great detail in early 
1999.  When the deal was closed, west power trading booked an in the money 
position and an offsetting expense of about $11 million.  This money has 
already liquidated from our book.  In fact, I have a copy of the 3/31/97 DPR 
that reflects this liquidation.  At that time, west power trading also paid a 
350k credit reserve, 247k to the finance book, and 1.3 million in 
origination.  

I have also heard about a "partnership" fee that Enron paid to Fort James 
around the same time.  I'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from 
it.  It had nothing to do with the west power trading book.

On John's recommendation I called Wes to see if we could figure this out.  
Wes, please give me a call back to discuss.  I think that someone needs to 
look at the actual journal entries from March of 1997 to see why an expense 
of $11 million was deferred.

This is not my problem.  I should not receive this expense.  Until this is 
resolved, I would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred 
account does not hit west power trading's expenses.

Joe, thanks for the assistance.  We have a few items still outstanding on the 
Doyle (Georgia PPA with Ogelthorpe) unit; however, It looks like we have the 
'99 and '00 plants completed.  The 2001 program is much smaller.  I will 
follow up shortly.

Gavin -

The teams did an outstanding job getting the big issues wrapped up this 
weekend.  All units at all the 2000 peaker sites can now be dispatched 
commercially.  In Navy jargon, BZ!!

Though you and I will need to continue OEM discussions on commercial issues 
and punch list items, ENA now has 2920 Mw's of capacity available for 
dispatch.  This is a big milestone with significant value to Enron.

Please extend my appreciation to all concerned for the weekend wrap-up and 
the extended hours required to make it happen.

Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.  There appears to be 
one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the 
development road.  If interested in these projects, which have to meet a 
December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we 
purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the 
asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.  
They are Ok with that strategy.  This is an opportuntity that needs to 
fleshed out fairly quickly - Ben and Dave can you lead this analysis with 
close contact with Doug and Tim on the desk.  We can get together to discuss 
if you like.

ENA has asked for EES customer references.  ENA is currently working with 
National Gypsum and National Gypsum has asked for two references. They would 
prefer manufacturers that have over 10% of their cost of goods sold as energy 
and have DSM projects completed at their facilities.  ENA has solicited my 
support in getting these references because when they asked EES Sales, they 
found them not to be overly cooperative with supplying names out of fear that 
ENA may burn out EES customers before EES Sales can use them.  

Since EES customers fall under Jeff's pervue, I need your help in getting the 
go-ahead to approach the account managers to set this up.  My suggestions 
would be World Color Press, Package Ice, Polaroid, or Ocean Spray.  Suiza 
would be a good choice if we could get the right person.  

ENA has asked me to get this information to them as soon as possible since 
the deal is on hold until they get the references.

Thanks,

Ray, I am ok with Nick and his group managing if Redmond/Mrha are ok.  Like 
Rebox, whoever is technically responsible is highly accountable to ensure 
that reporting and procedures are correctly followed and that the project 
comes in on time, budget and technically works.   In this capacity, I would 
like that engineer to report to you or Wayne Mays.

Scott,

I would like to re-emphasize our commitment to you and your team in ensuring 
this project is successful.  As we had discussed we are very eager to provide 
Project Management services for the Millenia project.  In fact Audrey and I 
am visiting BCCK this Friday to be sure we are not leaving anything else on 
the table which Enron could capture.  We in fact have identified one of our 
PMs, who has over 20 years experience in the industry, to lead the project.  
He will be augmented by Audrey who is not only a terrific process engineer 
but is managing the Lost Creek process plant/compressor station intallation 
in Wyoming.

My team is also managing the implementation of the Fort Union Gas Gathering 
project in Wyoming.

I understand things are heating up and all of us are looking forward to you 
kicking off the project.  Please feel free to call me at x58273.

Nick-

Per our conversation, Ward Polzin from the Producer Finance Group mentioned 
that during their presentation to Dave Delaney with Ray Bowen-VP Commercial 
and Scott Josey, the subject of who would do the project management for Enron 
came up.  Ward said my name was mentioned and that Ray Bowen said that if I 
couldn't he knew of a group from Power that did Project Management.

I would highly recommend you step in quickly offering our services before the 
decision is made to use someone else.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Audrey

Jeff, what is your current thought process on TXU?
Regards
Delainey
	
	

Since TXU is in such a world of hurt, do we have anyone looking at their 
business/assets?  Maybe we could lend the Enron helping hand....Jeff

Guys, I am getting the impression that we are having quality control issues - 
it just sounds sloppy?  Am I wrong?  Do we need more focused resources?

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Unit 1 tripped today while running.  There is some kind of foreign object 
loose in the unit.  It is unclear if the foreign object is in the compressor 
section of the hot gas path section.  We will not know the cause or extent of 
damage until the unit is boroscoped tomorrow.  

Units 2 & 3:  Will be back in commercial operation tomorrow.  The team is 
currently working on solutions to the demister.  No solution yet, but Unit 3 
will return to commercial operation tomorrow.

Unit 4:  Emissions tuning continues.  The latest numbers are NOx 6 ppm, CO 50 
ppm.

Unit 5:  To fire tomorrow and begin tuning.

Gary, I have not heard much more on this issue - are you ok with this?

I would argue that if he was in the top 30%, we should accomodate his need.

Rich Cassano, an ENA Associate candidate with an outstanding offer, has asked 
if Enron would pay for he and his wife to visit Houston for prior to his 
making a decision to joining Enron. This candidate is from New York and has 
only been to Houston for the Super Saturday weekend. He feels that he can't 
make an informed decision on relocating without spending additional time in 
Houston.

The Associate Program does not cover this expense. Please let me know if you 
are willing to cover travel expenses for this candidate and for other 
candidates with a similar requests.

The meeting scheduled to discuss NG Resources Funding will be held in Dave 
Delainey's office, EB3314, tomorrow, at 11:00 a.m.

Guys, the project should be charged market based rates and ENA is not in the 
business of subsidizing international projects.  This is particularily the 
case if we are not going to hold a continued interest in the project.

However, if we can not reach a term O&M agreement please maintain the 
optionality in the project by managing the facility on a direct bill basis to 
APACHI until they find an alternative provider. Do not in any event abandon 
any assets at any time.

Regards
Delainey

A couple of points:

1) Dobler says that he has been in Nigeria for six months with no 
compensation and very poor communication.
2) The scope has changed from 3 barges to 9 barge.
3) His price quote is cost reimbursement plus $750,000/year for approximately 
thirteen years.  PV is between $5 and $6 million.
4) APACHI is having a severe case of sticker shock.
5) He insists this is market for a major international provider.

I need to understand your view as to whether we should price at market or 
does OEC have the mandate to be a "support" function for other Enron 
businesses (I assume the answer is NO)

Ray
James A Hughes@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
06/11/2000 10:27 PM
Dave:

It is apparent that we are not going to reach agreement on an O&M contract 
that will be acceptable to third parties.  Given our clear intention to exit 
this project as fast as possible and extract our value through a promote, 
this leaves me no choice but to seek other alternatives.  I would appreciate 
your providing me interim O&M services until I can identify a third party 
service provider.  If you carry out your threat to abandon the assets, this 
will result in invalidation of our insurance coverage.  I hope you understand 
that this is not in anyone's interest.  I am disappointed to discover that 
our first experience with the new structure of O&M services is so 
unsatisfactory.

Please forward to the person in charge of New Generation Projects.

I was referred to you by the Energy Information Agency.  I was wondering if 
you could help me find new generation work within your company.  If you are 
not in the market for additional capacity I would appreciate your comments on 
how I might proceed.

We primarily install, relocate or otherwise put power in service on a turnkey 
basis, virtually anywhere in the world.   We also do major repairs, 
mechanical and electrical, rotating equipment and even substation 
equipment.    We have a rather strange assortment of equipment to support our 
work, special hydra lift trailers for moving large engine without 
disassembly, cranes for use in trying areas, high voltage bucket trucks, a 
portable repair shop that can be moved to a major site that is 100 ft X 60 ft 
and is fully equipped for anything from turbine repairs, installs or we can 
do a large rewind ..

For off-shore work we have a floating shop, a service vessel that has 
equipment on-board to move generation or also do similar service and 
repairs.     An example might be a turbine or other generation installation 
even on a barge power plant that is in service .. we can often dock along 
side and do it all as though the barge was in a harbor.

Sometimes, in addition to supplying New Equipment, we can supply used, 
refurbished or surplus assets.  Several possible powerplants considered for 
relocation are made available by Marcor Remediation Inc.  Marcor is working 
with the Jacksonville Electric Authority, Basin Electric and other major US 
utilities to offer certain Surplus Generating Assets to the worlds energy 
sectors.  This equipment is listed in some detail on our company webpage
(http://www.marcor.com/services/sales/sales.htm.)    This is a partial 
listing so let me know if your company contacts are in the market for 
anything in particular, we may be able to help.

These are additional properties I am working on, we handle Turnkey 
installations all over the world as well as a good deal of offshore work.   
Currently, we can deliver an LM 6000, up and running in less than 90 days.

BARGE MOUNTED POWER PLANT, 100+ MEGAWATT

We can provide a 100+  MW Barge Mounted Power Plant, complete, ABS Certified, 
consisting of two (2) 50 MW Gas Turbine Generators.
Outputs are at ISO conditions.  These units will be refurbished and ready to 
operate on either Natural Gas or Fuel Oil and installed on an ABS certified 
barge.  Delivery can occur within approximately 120 working days (4 months) 
after receipt of funds as specified below.
The two Gas Turbines will be set up to operate singularly or in parallel.
The Generator output will be 10,800 volts, 3-phase, 50 HZ.  (With upgrade to 
60 HZ available)  The power will be transported to shore by overhead 
transmission lines at Generator voltage.  A control room will be provided 
together with switchgear and circuit disconnects.

The customer/buyer will be responsible for providing all fuel needs including 
delivery and storage of fuel.  The customer will also be responsible for all 
Grid connections and transformation of power.

We will provide, as part of the Barge package, an emergency generator for 
lighting and Barge pumps.  The Turbines can be started with electric motors 
powered from the emergency generator (diesel fueled) or by pressurized air.

All of this equipment is offered subject to prior sale.  The costs will be 
adjusted accordingly if additional or substitute equipment is required by 
customer.

The two (2) Gas Turbines can be adapted to operate on Heavy Fuel (HFO) or 
Bunker "C" or #6 Fuel oil, providing proper oil treatment modules are 
utilized.  We will offer this equipment under separate Contract.

ESTIMATE OF COSTS:
100 + MW Power Barge can be furnished as described for approx. $300.00 USD/ 
kW or $ 30,000,000.00.
Any commissions, "finders fees", or other unidentified costs, shall be added 
to the cost shown here.  At this price, USED equipment is utilized.

To prepare a formal quotation and provide detailed equipment specifics, i.e. 
model numbers, serial numbers, etc., a one-percent (1%) Cash Advance shall be 
placed in an escrow account with draws for the preparation of same and 
expenses incurred.  An Executed "Non-Disclosure, Non-Compete, Non-Circumvent 
Agreement" must be signed by the "end-user".  It will take two (2) weeks, 
after receipt of one-percent (1%) cash advance funds, and after ALL pertinent 
information regarding the ultimate construction of the barge is received by 
us from the buyer, to prepare the Formal Quotation.

After receipt of the Formal Quotation/Proposal,  buyer shall have two (2) 
weeks to place a five-percent (5%) refundable deposit which will allow him 
thirty (30) days to perform "due diligence".  At the end of this "due 
diligence" period, buyer shall pay eighty-five percent (85%) of the total 
purchase price.  The balance due shall be paid upon customer acceptance of 
the unit.

Currently, we have a "window" of opportunity open to immediately initiate 
necessary engineering work.  This work will be accomplished by "World Class" 
Maritime Contractors; therefore, meeting the highest of Standards.

Tim, in the east power group and the gas groups, we are trying to build a

Please see tha attached.  I would be curious to talk to you about your 
structure, coverage functions and market building iniatives.  

I recognize that you and your group have been the most effective and 
proactive group in these areas for some time.  Is there areas where we could 
be more aggressive or proactive?  Can I get you more resources to cover the 
market more aggresively?

Ed, this looks great!!!! 

 Please ensure that the focus is on coverage, deal flow and building markets. 
 I want to avoid two groups hunting strategic elephants (ie) east origination 
and development so ensure the scope is consistent with mid-market coverage 
and feeding the desk deals and info.   In the case of building or purchasing 
assets please let Jacoby's group handle.  Any deal or lead that significantly 
disrupts coverage or takes you or your people out of the market please pass 
or coordinate with origination or development

There is bound to be some conflict between the strategic origination groups 
and you - please keep to a minimum and resolve in a manner consistent with 
one team and doing the right thing.

Please provide John and I a monthly report of customer transactions 
completed, coverage plans and "market building iniatives".  

Let me know how I can assist in any way in recruiting or transactions.

Dave...a brief update re Toronto. We have moved from 3 employees Jan 1, 2000 
to 13 employees. Recent hires are as follows:

1. Scott Gilbert (expat)   Manager  Volume Management
2. Chris Gaffney (from ENA)  Sr Counsel  Legal
3. Garrett Tripp (expat)   Manager  Power Trading
4. Jeff Borg (outside hire)  Director   Origination

8. Lindsey Huculiak (outside hire) Admin Asst  General
9.Jahnet Theberge (oustside hire) Sr Admin Asst  General
10. Neil Stuchbury (outside hire)  Sr Specialist  Volume Management

As discussed, we have attempted to obtain a good mix of  "Enron DNA" and 
outside hires. We are currently in the process of hiring a marketer from Duke 
who covers eastern industrials on the gas side (John Guerriero, an engineer,  
background is UnionGas) and would like to target a couple of associates from 
Houston.  

Our national advertising campaign has finished its run and we received in 
excess of 350 resumes. We are currently reviewing the resumes and have 
scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday for June 24th in Toronto (Davies, Le 
Dain, Kitagawa, Devries, Dadson, McKay and myself will conduct the 
interviews).

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

Catalytica filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC yesterday, December 
11th which disclosed that because of recent market conditions the Board had 
decided not to proceed with the planned stock split prior to the spin-off.  
The supplement indicates an expected initial trading range "at a price 
between $20 and no less than $10 per share".   Based upon these new 
Catalytica's estimates, the value of the Enron investment would be $13.5 to 
$27.0 million.  Enron's Catalytica investment is part of the raptor structure 
so that the impact is on raptor capacity rather than earnings.  The 
investment has also been monetized in a FAS 125 structure for cash flow 
purposes.

Guys, lets get together to get final resolution to these issues including the 
peaker fee asap.

I am contacting you to confirm our meeting with you and some of your 
colleagues next Wed. June 14th, 3-4PM.  Attending on Enron Wind's behalf will 
be Kurt Huneke and Adam Umanoff (MD, Commercial Americas)

In the last two months Enron completed the acquisition of the minority shares 
(~20%) in Enron Wind Corp.   As a result of this decision, Enron has also 
made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our 
return in this industry.

One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the 
various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.  As the regulatory 
environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are 
evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position.

We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin 
Presto were available to join us as well.  Please feel free to invite anyone 
else you feel would be appropriate.  As you may know, we have begun to 
discuss some of these opportunities with EPMI and we are encouraged by the 
way we see the market developing.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this meeting.

Thank you,

I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with 
Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and 
very early in discussions that a "CA" at this time was not needed.  There 
were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no "CA".  Let me 
know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks!

Dave,

Some time back you should have received a voicemail from Paula Rieker 
regarding my seeking a meeting with you.  I was located in India at the time, 
and project Summer was on at the time.  Hence, after a couple of initial 
attempts, I decided to wait a while before I sought a meeting with you.

However, now with Project Summer behind us, I would like to meet with you to 
discuss potential opportunities in the North America Region.  I was part of 
the Associate pool at ECT, and have worked with Jim Fallon and Paula Rieker, 
among others.  I had then taken an assignment to work in India, and have been 
there for some years now.

I am in Houston for the rest of the week and will be seeking to get on your 
calender for a brief chat on opportunities in your group.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Bob Virgo has informed me that the desk wants to convert Gleason to combined 
cycle.  Bob told me this in the context of asking me whether Calpine would 
sell us any additional combined cycle equipment (i.e., steam turbines).  My 
guess is they won't.

If 1) it was of interest to us and 2) we are really going to convert Gleason, 
I think I could get Calpine to execute a purchase/short term tolling 
transaction on Gleason on favorable terms.  I say this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Calpine is typically a strong bid for combined cycle installations.
2.  Calpine has been trying unsuccessfully to get a combined cycle project in 
TVA (due to their rank in the cue) and thinks that it will take them a year 
to get through TVA.  We actually think that their project is blocked. 
3.  Calpine would likely take the incremental construction cost risk on the 
transaction.
4.  I believe that Calpine would undertake the permitting and interconnection 
work at their cost  and risk, if needed.  Given the cost of preparing a 
combined cycle permit along with the potential fight that ENA might face from 
TVA in such an effort, this risk sharing scenario could be attractive to ENA.
5.  Calpine would likely accept a short term tolling arrangement.  On their 
eastern assets, Calpine is generally executing 1-2 year deals.
6.  Calpine particularly in the east has been aggressively purchasing 
projects.
7.  If feasible, Calpine would probably be willing to further increase the 
size of Gleason.  Calpine's current plants announcements are generally in the 
700-1,000 MW range.

I know that Dave Delainey has not previously supported selling Gleason 
individually.  However, you may want to investigate if anything has changed 
in this circumstance, particularly since we are not generally a strong bid 
for combined cycle projects.  Please let me know. 

FYI--Dave Duran and I are meeting with Bob Kelly of Calpine on next Tuesday 
to discuss the use of Enron NOLs in Calpine's PG&E contract buyouts. 

This memo will confirm our dinner meeting to be held June 21, 2000 at the

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Kay (3x0643) or 
Beverly (5x7857)

I will look forward to seeing you there.

Guys, we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue; 
however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohane 
out of the day to day fray on this issue.  I believe this is the right call.  
Commercial and legal resources from Houston will manage this issue on a go 
forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time. 
You have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts 
on that front are much appreciated.  Our focus should return to growing the 
business and meeting our financial targets.

Peter, I believe that Mark H. would like you to stay involved through the 
Friday conference call that is scheduled.

I just heard that Chris Gaffney is transferring to the Toronto office. His 
skill sets/capabilities have been critical in the closing of both the UI and 
NSTAR deals and he has been actively engaged in the long-term NSTAR deal, 
Con-Ed, and our Project Green Jacket. It is critical to our business to have 
no transitional period with attorneys and I expect his replacement to be 
fully up to speed (i.e. knowledge of the power market, understanding of 
structured power transactions, etc) relative to definitive documents around 
these transactions. Chris is definitely a loss to our team. Please advise as 
to his qualified replacement on these specific deals.  Thanks. 

Meeting with Janet Dietrich, Dave Fairley, Billy Lemmons, Jeff Hodge  
regarding Duke L & G

Don, lets hang tough for a day or two.  Nothing needed for Cinergy.

Jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current North American 
energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and 
determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or 
existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility 
levels.

  In particular, I think that Miller should take a look at coal gasification 
technologies, emissions technologies and DSM/efficiency technologies and how 
these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business.  As well, 
from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) 
IPP, E&P, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves 
and expectations.

Can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so - maybe it 
would help to go pick a few brains in various ENA orgs as part of your 
process.

Regards
Delainey

Mike, why would it cost $450 to $470/kw for the Moore project?  It is a 4 
unit ABB configuration and the turbine costs appear to be in line with Wilton 
7EA's on a kw basis.

Dave, the impression we are getting is that Houston thinks this deal is dead 
or on the back burner. Until you tell me otherwise, we are going full steam 
ahead. Is there any way that you can help us get the airtime we need down 
south? We are now down to crunch time, and I dont want to see this project 
slip away due to control groups dragging their feet.

The following is a status update of key current items:
1. We continue to try to confirm the viability of the Peoples units.  We have 
not received NOx versus water injection data.  We still have not received the 
full noise spectrum data.  It looks like the only source for this is ABB and 
they're not fast.  Peoples and ourselves are going after ABB on these issues 
(and the possibility of a change order on the exciter design which doesn't 
meet Ontario specs).
 - we have confirmed that the municipality can provide 600 USGPM of water, 
but the silica content has to be confirmed to see if it's a problem.  I met 
with Terra Industrial Tuesday and they remain interested in providing the 
treated water, but they would have to expand their treatment plant.  They can 
provide 1/3rd of the water required and their permit can handle the waste 
stream on regen for the full water flow - we're sorting out the optimum tank 
capacity versus treatment plant capacity sizing to meet reliability at 
minimum cost.  Bottom line is we've got options to handle this water flow and 
we can avoid trying to get a permit for waste water.
 - we're going to use the noise consultant EE&CC used in conjunction with 
Agra Envir. in Canada to sort out the low frequency noise problem, and check 
the other frequencies against our nearest receptor, once we get the data from 
ABB.
 - Peoples are checking with ABB on the possibility of a change order on the 
exciter design.
2. MCN/Columbus have come back on the other two N2 units - they want another 
$1 MM US and can't confirm any changes to the contract.
We are completing our comparison of the Peoples/MCN contracts - the MCN 
contract is much better (guarantees, liquidated damages etc.) but of course 
power output is less.
3. We kicked off Agra to prepare our permit amendment (using data from both 
the Peoples N2's and MCN N2's).
4. NEPCO capital cost estimate will be ready June 9th.  It looks like $2-3 MM 
will come out of the base estimate for the N1's due to the acceleration and 
winter work coming out.  They still have to do the N2 estimate.  There might 
be a chance to push this ahead to the end of the 7th if we were to pressure 
them more.
5. We feel we can increase our N1 output up by 6 MW at 90F without 
incremental O&M.  The Peoples units would add an incremental 40 MW at 90F.

Using the Peoples units our capital per kW at 90 F is $397 US/kW (using our 
original $156 MM incl. IDC estimate less $2 MM).
Using the MCN units our capital per kW at 90F is $443 US/kW.

Issues:
1. We are not getting great support from Houston in many areas, with the 
exception of some like Don Miller/Genco.  It appears that some groups like 
underwriting/RAC and structuring either are getting the message this project 
is not going ahead, or are taking our continued delays in approval to work on 
all of their other priorities (hoping that we will go away presumably...).  
Schedule becomes more of a concern every day.
2. The Ontario interconnection timing becomes more and more of a concern each 
day that passes as OH isn't the fastest working entity.  Aleck and Duncan 
continue to work the IMO/OHSC/OEB angles but with some of the rules not set 
yet we may need higher level pressure at some time soon.  I'll let you know.

Rob,this deal is not dead; I am primarly waiting on NEPCO numbers.

You should be moving down the road on the deconstruction, refurbishment and 
movement of the NB machines.   You should also be doing any development work 
(permits, interconnection agreements et al) you need to do to maintain the 
optionality of this project (let me know if the expenses get above $1MM).

Randy, please facilitate. Mike, can we put the screws to ABB given the 
significant transformer business we forwarded their way?

Laura, we probably need to make a call on the Peoples turbine pretty soon.

Eric/Rob, I think we need to see the project with IDC come in  between 350 to 
400/kw to be viable or I need a very detailed analysis of why it costs 
significantly more than a Frame 7 machine in the US markets.

I would like see us make this work.

Good job - Randy.

Live to fight another day - I don't know if you know but I settled with Fort 
James - we ripped up all three contracts for no money that netted us 
approximately $15M in value through the elimination of the two power 
contracts in the NW.  Wertz was on the other side.  Thought you might want to 
know.

Rodney, please give Cliff a call.  I spoke with him today.  He will handle.  
Please fill him in on your discussions to date.

Thanks
Delainey

Dave,

The Bid Offer is now officially at $0 - $17MM - See below offer from Merrill.

Below is the response from Dan Gordon who was my counterpart at Merrill after 
my discussion with him where I told him I wanted to just terminate the trade 
without paying any fees.  I had asked Dan to come up with a number they would 
think appropriate for terminating the trade.  I also discussed the deal with 
their relationship officer Robert Furst so they are all engaged.  I think Dan 
is simply trying to elicit a higher first bid from us without him doing any 
work or potentially leaving any money on the table since it is us that wants 
to unwind the trade.

I have Rogers Herndon pulling some information on how much the position has 
moved since we did the deal.  I also have him working through what we would 
have done if we owned the deal i.e. how much gas basis risk we would have 
mitigated and what the value would be now as well and any other hedges we 
would have put on and the value of them now.  This will give us information 
to either negotiate or at least get a better picture of what a better offer 
should be.  I have also notified Elizabeth Sager, our lawyer, to dig back in 
and get back up to speed on the deal to prepare to discuss it.  

As I see it our options are: 

Option 1:  Negotiate
Rogers/Kevin/Myself go to NY and negotiate/highlight the risks in the deal 
with ML

Option 2: Relationship Play
Either myself or Cliff start leaning on the relationship people at ML to 
force ML into a more realistic first offer.  

Let me know your thoughts on how you want to proceed.
Rodney

Rodney-

Merrill Lynch has reviewed the transaction that was executed with Enron in
December, 1999 involving physically and financially settled call options on
certain mid-continent peakers owned by Enron.  At that time, a fee of
approximately $17 million was charged to execute the transaction.

Since the execution of the trade, Merrill Lynch has had to manage the risk
associated with the sizeable position as well as hedge certain gas basis
risks that Merrill Lynch was obligated to assume in order to accommodate the
accounting treatment desired by Enron as part of the transaction.
Additionally, as I am sure that you and your traders are aware, the position
has considerably appreciated in value since trade execution.

Even with these factors, Merrill Lynch is prepared to accommodate Enron's
request to terminate the transaction in exchange for a fee of $17 million.
This fee encompasses the original fee that Enron had agreed to pay to
Merrill Lynch and does not take into consideration any of Merrill Lynch's
hedge breakage costs or our foregone upside in the trade.

Should you wish to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Regards, as always.

Dan Gordon

Eric, we need more than $2M saving to get this deal to clear the hurdle.  I 
think we need to get to $350 to $400/kw firm including IDC to make this 
viable.  Please ensure that NEPCO is working to figure out the disconnect.

Delainey

Dick , I appreciate the effort on the Moore project - I would hope that there 
is more than a $2m saving in the scope.  This plant is still showing $460 to 
$470/Kw given current economics.  I am still puzzled by this.

Dave,
Re schedule:
1.  We are proceeding with the kick-off of the permit amendment, and will be 
using a combination of both the MCN and Calumet N2 unit data.  Per my phone 
message, it will take about a week or two to prepare the amendment at a cost 
up to $10,000 US, and then eight weeks to get the amendment.  We should be 
able to commence site work without the amendment, to the point of completing 
foundations, based on previous discussions with the Municipality, County and 
Ontario Ministry of Envir..
Even though this work is not in our $35 MM US original DASH budget, we are 
planning to proceed with this unless you've got a problem with it.
2.  NEPCO have preliminarily re-worked the schedule now on the N1 
disassembly, move and install, and the N2 installation.  They believe they 
need to get on site by the third week in June to begin site clearing in order 
to initiate foundation work by mid July.  Between June 15 and July 15 they 
would do the foundation design - this should be on the generous side given 
that we had done some foundation design last fall, and with MCN at least have 
some of the N2 foundation work already done by ABB.
Whether it's June 21 or 30 to start the site clearing, the schedule is 
getting tight.

Re capital cost estimate:
3.  NEPCO is able to complete the revised capital cost estimate on the N1/N2 
case by June 9th at the latest (they're looking at moving it up to the 5th or 
6th if they work the weekend).  They have a problem at the moment as they are 
moving offices over this weekend and will lose about 4 days.  They will have 
a revised estimate on the N1 case by the end of next week - it looks today 
like the cost savings for no acceleration and winter work and being able to 
barge the units versus railing them, will all be worth at least $2 MM US. 
I'm assuming we would take the capital costs estimate into our DASH as soon 
as the estimate is ready and go for approval, so that we can meet schedule - 
I'm not sure where you stand on the "roll-up" approval on Moore, Pastoria and 
Las Vegas if the latter two don't go into Genco.
Meanwhile, progress through RAC on the DASH continues.

Re N2 units:
4.  We continue to sort out whether the Calumet units might work from a noise 
and water perspective.  We still haven't seen the MCN/Columbus counter on the 
other units but they claim it's coming.

Dave, I am going to send Shawn your way - he has extensive development, asset 
and project finance experience.  I would like him under your supervision to 
manage our coal power development strategy - like we discussed it could be a 
very robust strategy with multiple exit points.  I strongly believe that coal 
needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams 
(Parquet & Jacoby) are already buried under mid-stream gas development 
opportunities.

This would incorporate acquisitions, development, technology,  asset sales, 
emissions credits & technology, fuel supply and power sales.

Please update your 2001 budget to incorporate this new iniative.

Delainey

Dave:

Thanks for your time and patience today.

For now, I'll park the theoretical and focus on the practical.  (we can pick 
up the other topics later over beers sometime)

I completely agree that the US coal-genco business can offer a huge near-term 
win for those that move swiftly.

Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it.

Shawn

John, great job!

Please, work with Jeff to move the longer term deal along.

Regards
Delainey

I would like to personally thank and congratulate everyone involved in 
helping ENA bring closure to the NSTAR wholesale power transaction.  Any 
transaction of this nature requires support from many people and I appreciate 
everyone's hard work in making this transaction a reality.  In addition, I 
believe ENA is well positioned for a longer term transaction with NSTAR.   I 
would encourage John Llodra and Jeff Ader to work closely together to create 
the best value proposition for Enron on the long term deal.
Strict Confidentiality language is embedded in the 6-month NSTAR transaction, 
and it is extremely important that everyone involved honors the zero 
tolerance nature of this Confidentiality provision.  The bottom line is that 
we cannot disclose anything about this deal to any third partiies, including 
the mere existence of the deal.   If we do not respect this provision fully, 
we will jeapordize our goodwill with the customer and thus our ability to 
move forward with a longer term transaction.  In addtion, there could be 
negative legal ramnifications.

Thanks again for a job well done.  If I missed anyone who was involved in the 
transaction, please forward this e-mail to those individuals.

Guys, I will set up a monthly meeting between myself and you guys to discuss 
deal flow, priorities and strategy - I think you will find that more 
effective and I can keep the other meeting small.

Kay, please set up.

Dave --

Effective May 19, I have replaced Elisabeth McCabe as head of ENA's Public 
Relations department.  With the recent reconfiguration of the ENA staff 
meeting, public relations has not been included.  I believe it is important 
to be in attendance at the weekly staff meetings, so public relations can 
stay abreast of the various deals/projects and be prepared to handle the 
public relations surrounding them.

I would like to request that I be added to the list of regular attendees.  
Additionally, I believe it would be helpful for Kathryn Corbally from 
Corporate Investor Relations to be in attendance as well.  She attended the 
meetings in the past and should be included for the same reasons.  If you 
would like to discuss this issue, please call me at ext. 3-9053.

Thanks.

Rob, I think we should renew the flame for the three year period.  My 
understanding is that it is $75 K Cdn per year roughly.  Not paid up-front 
and cancellable if Flames leave Calgary or disappear.  Expense in Canada.  It 
is your call ultimately.

Regards

Janet, I though we signed a turnkey with NEPCO - there should not be any 
overruns to your P&L if that is the case.

Regards
Delainey
Janet R Dietrich
05/25/2000 08:30 AM
Dave, since the ENA power desk will be receiving 100% of all earnings related 
to the City of Austin capacity, it's only appropriate that any cost overruns 
will be sent directly to their P/L. There isn't anything that leads me to 
believe there will be overruns, but you know how that goes with NEPCO and I 
want to be very clear up front that if something should occur, I have no 
ability to offset the cost with other Austin earnings. 

I'd also like to set aside some time when we can talk thru several business 
items/issues. The teaser list is as follows:  continuing internal noise 
between the desks and origination groups related to deals and primarily the 
P/L split (any maybe a few solutions), the followup and status and 
recommendations on the global LNG business and ENA's interest (I've had 
meetings with Doug Rotenburg, Vince Kiminski, others, and new info from our 
Duke meeting), status of Chicago office, clarification on leftover items from 
Columbia acquisition last year, employee hiring/contracts,  etc.

Maybe we can get together this afternoon or tomorrow. How about the status of 
the FP&L meeting with Jim Broadhead?
Janet R Dietrich
05/25/2000 08:04 AM
Hey guys. I would like an outline of the City of Austin project as far as how 
this will be managed from ENA's standpoint. My understanding is that Jeff 
Keenan will be the Project Manager for ENA and will be entirely responsible 
for the implementation of all aspects to bring the plant to commercial 
operations. This would include schedule, permitting, interconnect agreements, 
managing NEPCO to the $88.3 million total cost, etc. Everyone needs to 
realize that this team will realize a true loss on any overruns above the 
$88.3 million. I've asked Tammy Shepherd to set up a budget, schedule and 
weekly distribution similarly to how we handled Doyle and the other projects. 
I'm assuming that this team is managing everything related to the Austin 
project and is accountable for its successful implementation. 

If we need to discuss anything related to the above, let me know.  Thanks.

John and Dave:

Does Wednesday May 31 at 2PM work for you ? Please let me know.

Dave,

To the extent you feel it is truly in ENA's best interest, Ed and I are 
prepared to honor your wishes with respect to Tom Swank joining the 
mid-market group.   However, it should be noted that we (as a group) have 
significant reservations about Tom disrupting the chemistry in our group.  
The input from all of my my key guys (including Rogers who worked with Swank 
at Dynegy for a number of years) was negative regarding Tom as a member of 
our team.

We are concerned about his longevity in the group and his work ethic in 
general.  Again, I am prepared to respect your decision (particularly since 
you control my paycheck) and give Tom the benefit of the doubt, but I wanted 
to express my reservations.

Please let me know your thoughts

Any ideas?  These guys (John & Jere) just can't get it together.

Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the 
insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern 
(especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally 
and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market 
perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding 
multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys 
could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a 
well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John 
at the offsite):
 a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer 
list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination 
if this is a commercially viable product;
 b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure 
a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and 
come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had 
promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote 
this capability to these customers ASAP;
 c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP;
 d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need 
to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.

This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.

We are heading down the road of a gate keeper approach which has proven very 
inefficient at Enron in the past.    Our group has already canceled a meeting 
with the CFO of Vintage because of this approach.  Rerarding  industry 
relationships, George Carrick, Mark Tawney and I have extensive relationships 
throughout the upstream sector, know the decision makers and can set up our 
own meetings, all in coordination with the upstream group.  At this time I am 
waiting on John's group to set up our meetings.  Seems very inefficient.

The main objective is to determine if there is demand for the product.  I 
will continue to coordinate through John but we need to meet to clarify roles 
and responsibilities of all parties - how will deals be structured, who will 
price, who will negotiate transaction, etc.

John Swafford spoke with David Vander in Wes' group last Tuesday and informed 
him that, after reviewing matters, the Corp. State and Local Group had 
reduced the charge to ENA from $821,000 to $321,000.  This reduction goes far 
to bringing costs in line with those from last year and, the remainder of the 
increase, relates to the expansion of support at Corp. related to the 
expansion of ENA's business.  Best regards.  Steve.

Regards

I spoke with Bob Hermann this afternoon and, in short, the single biggest 
contributor to the increase in the corporate tax allocation relates to the 
expansion of state and local tax support being provided to our new "business 
verticals" - that is, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and 
Enron Net Works - which expense should be specifically allocated to such 
groups rather than ENA, as is currently the case.  I will follow up with you 
regarding the revised number after I have resolved the allocation issue.  
Best regards.  Steve. 

David W Delainey
11/10/2000 12:53 PM
Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.

Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market 
group in east power and make a difference.  I would strongly support his 
movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion.  

I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power 
mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in 
those markets.  I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new 
associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various 
desks.  The goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and 
mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups.

a)  I do not believe Skilling is aware of the latest updates on our efforts

it was brought to his attention was March 1999 (Blue Range default).  We do 
report our top exposures to him and the Board which includes CNR, 
Petro-Canada, and Talisman on a quarterly basis.  Rob and team are actively 
working with my team to mitigate exposures through other measures.
b) I will be happy to provide insight as needed.  The riskiest commercial 
objections are from Lagrasta's group.
c) We have received margin from Sempra and Duke.  We have a valuation dispute 
with Statoil and are actively working through the details.

Guys, I went throught the Credit Margin Exception Report for 4/24/00.  This 
shows our excess credit exposure at approximately $ 391M (after guarantees).  
I have a couple of questions:

 a) Canada (>$200M) - Rick/Bill/Rob - Is the board and Skilling aware of the 
credit positions and OK?   I know Rob has been working on    mitigation plans;
 b) Commercial Objections: (>$67M)
  - Paper - Edward ($27M) - The report shows a number of commerical 
objections to calling for collateral ie) Repap,  Times Mirror and Waste   
Mgt. Can you give me a call to discuss - we may need documentation to support;
  - Gas/Mid-Mkt - Jeff ($29M)- Do you own Cross Timbers Oil Co, Torch Energy, 
Aurora Natural Gas, Seneca Resource Corp and Cody Energy?   We have in these 
cases additional commercial objections to calling for collateral - lets 
discuss;
  - Mariner  ($9M)- Ray we are showing a collateral need of approx. $9.0M - 
given our equity position this may be moot;however, lets discuss.
 c) Margin Call (>$51M) - Rick/Bill - have we been successful in getting the 
margin posted by Sempra, Statoil and Duke?

Canada is a tricky issue; however, we should be able to work down the 
commercial objections and collect on the margin calls to get the number down.

Larry and Joe, 

Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get 
the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues  
and the vibration issues at Wheatland?  The phone call by Larry to GE has 
made a world of difference.

Regards

Gavin Gaul@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
05/17/2000 03:01 PM
Mark,

We have been working diligently with Westinghouse to get a schedule for the 
removal and modification of the blade rings at Gleason.  I requested 
Westinghouse begin to prepare for this work on Sunday after you confirmed 
that we could no longer tolerate the operating restriction being added to the 
unit.  Based on discussions with Westinghouse on Sunday, we estimated that 
the work could be completed in 14 days.  The site began disassembly of unit 
#2 on Monday.  Unit #1 disassembly began on Tuesday because we had to wait 
for the unit to cool down.  

The first verbal schedule from Westinghouse was received Monday night.  It 
showed the blade rings being machined in series at a single shop and resulted 
in the lasy unit being delayed about 4 days.  I told Westinghouse this would 
not be acceptable and that the blade rings needed to be machined in 
parallel.  Westinghouse agreed and has made a second shop available.  Another 
schedule was published yesterday afternoon that required an additional step 
in the disassembly that I felt was not required and added a day to the 
duration.  Westinghouse suggested that we remove the compressor blades from 
the rotor before we remove the blade rings.  I have since concluded that 
removing the rotor blades first is in fact the correct procedure. 

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, this schedule for the blade 
rings, which has been at the site since last night,  will be distributed to 
everyone today.  In addition, the site will incorporate the remaining startup 
activities and issue an integrated schedule tonight.

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, it is very unlikely that Gleason 
#1 and #2 can be available by June 1.  Our optimistic estimate from the 
meeting this morning was June 4-7.

Gavin

John/Gavin -

We have made progress over the last week in getting GE attention focused on 
the emissions problems at Lincoln.  After 6 days of daily conferences on the 
subject, GE has arrived in force at Lincoln, with the personnel and resources 
required to address the problem.  We are not out of the woods yet, but I 
believe everything is now being done that can be done to get as many machines 
available as possible by June 1.

Enron needs the same focus from Westinghouse, on  issues currently plagueing 
Wheatland and Gleason.  Unlike Lincoln, where the machines are capable of 
producing MW's, these two sites have units that cannot operate.  Namely, 
vibration issues on units 1 and 2 at Wheatland and compressor blade ring 
issues on units 1 and 2 at Gleason.

ENA has been requesting since Monday this week, a definitve and complete 
schedule from EECC, showing the disassembly, shipping, machining, reassembly 
and testing of units 1 and 2 blade rings at Gleason.  We still do not have 
this schedule.  Furthermore, it would appear that after this morning's 
meeting, there is some confusion on what work actually needs to be performed 
in order to accomplish this task and what impact that may have on the 14-day 
schedule committed to ENA by Gavin Gaul on 5/15.  I am not sure whether the 
communication breakdown is between business units at Westinghouse or between 
Enron and Westinghouse, but a schedule and plan is the first step towards 
getting the work done and we are two days into the work.  I am expecting this 
plan to be circulated today.

Lastly, although we have been verbally assured by Westinghouse that there 
will be no operating restrictions, other than routine borescope inspections 
during off-peak periods, OEC would be more comfortable getting this in 
writing.  We are requesting a formal notice from Westinghouse, identifying 
any operational restrictions (post-blade ring repair) on these units.

If there is any assistance you require, please do not hesitate to request 
it.  We collectively have 14 days to declare all 15 units ready for 
commercial operation.

Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both 
himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which 
should help leverage your product into this sector. Scott and John have 
agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets 
with no delay.  From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team 
will go speak to them about the opportunities.  I would expect that we will 
be in front of these folks ASAP.  Lets see how the product is embraced by 
these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal 
alignment of the groups.  As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are 
working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.

Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would 
be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame 
and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you 
or me to participate.

I spoke to Max and he agrees with this approach.

I hope this meets with your approval.

Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?   If it 
is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable 
display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community 
and it should continue to sponsor the flame.  On the accounting front, 
expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and 
budgeted next.

Let discuss

Barry Tycholiz
05/15/2000 05:52 PM
Rob, further to our conversation. I have had attached a couple of the notes 
recently sent to the PR group.  Historically, the expense for this 
advertising has been paid by the Houston. The overall expense item was not 
that large and Corp was paying because generally they were not supporting any 
other expense in Calgary and deemed this request reasonable.  If possible I 
would ask that you secure approval from Delainey with regards to the renewal 
of this item.

Needless to say, this Flame has been a flagship for Enron in the Hockey 
community and our association with the Flames ownership committee does not go 
unnoticed !

Please let me know if you need anything but our basic request is corporate 
approval to reimburse canada for the next 3 years @ approx. $ 50,000.00 
US/year. 

Thanks in advance, Barry  

 
Kal Shah
05/02/2000 12:25 PM
Barry -- While PR can approve the look and feel of the sign, the cost would 
have to be approved by ENA Chairman's office.  Generally, it has been my 
understanding that each commercial group pays for such marketing expenses 
from its own budget.  As I am no longer working in the PR group, it would be 
best if you contact the Chairman's office directly to present the business 
case and request expense approval.

Kal,  further to my previous e-mail. This note is to advise as to the final 
costs that will be associated with the renewal of the Enron sponsorship.

We have negotiated a 3 year deal with the Calgary Flames.  Can you please 
verify via e-mail that ECC will be reimbursed by ENA for this annual 
advertising expense.  Upon receipt of the invoice, we will process payment 
and coordinate this on your behalf. 

Nov 2000 - Nov 2001        $68,000 + 7 % Tax = $72,760. / $ 1.47 ( Currency 
).  Approx. $ 50,000.00 US/Year advertising expense. 

Invoicing for this up coming season will be in the next couple of months.  I 
will also coordinate the execution of all documents regarding legal 
liability, renewal rights etc.  

Thanks in advance. Barry

Guys, I appreciate the updates. Please ensure 1) that you, as ENA, are 
integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with EE&CC with a credible 
plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed.  You 
will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we 
get over the goal line.

Keep me in the loop daily so that I can keep the pressure on at a senior 
level.

From Mike Miller and Mitch Robinson

John -

After today's conference call regarding the peakers and after today's failed 
attempt to commercially dispatch two of the units at the Lincoln facility, we 
see the following action items that need immediate resolution in order to get 
the peakers back on schedule:

Lincoln:
1.  Discussion with GE at sufficiently high level to determine whether any GE 
units at any sites have ever made <9 ppm NOx with CO <25 ppm (M. Dobler has 
initiated this discussion with Michelle April of GE).
2.  A detailed plan of attack from GE to get the units within guarantee 
emission limits.
3.  Resolution of the HMI sluggish response issue complete with a plan of 
attack.  The units can be run, but are clearly not ready for commercial 
operation with the sluggish HMI.

Wheatland:
1.  A plan of attack from Westinghouse to correct the fuel valves (and/or 
nozzles) on units 1 and 2.  Currently, the units can not be run reliably at 
base load.
2.  Plan of attack and schedule to correct the vibrations on 1 & 2.
3.  A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls 
support (this comment also applies to Gleason); sharing Rutledge and PCD 
controls personnel is proving inadequate.
4.  Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to 
get answers.  A dedicated EE&CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office 
would help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Gleason also).

Gleason:
1.  A detailed schedule and plan of attack is needed for the compressor blade 
modifications on units 1&2.
2.  An on-site EE&CC representative is required to bird-dog the compressor 
blade seals modification.
3.  Verification from Westinghouse that the 12 day modification will not slip 
into 3 weeks is required (see item 1).
4.  Verification that the IGV's have been fully corrected is required.
5.  A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls 
support (this comment also applies to Wheatland); sharing Rutledge and PCD 
controls personnel is proving inadequate.
6.  Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to 
get answers.  A dedicated EE&CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office 
would help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Wheatland also).

Mitch Robinson & Mike Miller

Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at 
Gleason?  Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me 
that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.  Do we have 
a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason?  

Please advise.

Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the 
Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.  I 
see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.  I 
also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and 
not loose any capability.  Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH 
by at least a third to one-half.  Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?

I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this 
needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the

Regards
Delainey
Christopher F Calger
05/13/2000 02:29 PM
Dave,

Update from Friday Afternoon:

Coyote:  Avista Board approved a 50% equity investment in Coyote Springs II 
and publicly announced their intention to move forward.  Their equity 
partner, BP Amoco, indicated that they need 30 more days to "get comfortable 
with the market".  This thirty day period coincides with the expected 
financial close of June 15 so it may just be posturing to let us know that 
they are not committed until the deal actually closes.  Nevertheless, we 
(Avista and Enron) will pursue fallback investors that have already seen the 
project and previously expressed interest in a 50% share.  In parallel, we 
will try to get BP Amoco "comfortable".  It might make sense to consider 
someone else that can move quickly.  Deal probability drops from 80% to 50%.

LVCogen:  Vickers and Gilbert met with Sierra Pacific and confirmed their 
interest in and ability to effect a restructuring of the PPA.  Although 
timing of "securitization" is open-ended, Sierra has agreed to a contract 
valuation that supports a valuation uplift of $10MM - $14MM.  If we assume a 
40%-50% probability of restructuring, we get to the hotlisted $5MM gain for 
QII.   Attached is a spreadsheet that shows the breakup value of LVCogen.  
CTG and Power Structuring are finalizing the RAC models that support this 
approach.

Chris

Scott, what is our emissions strategy for these counterparties?

E&E Newsline - May 11, 2000

MASSACHUSETTS POWER PLANTS AGREE TO SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES

     Massachusetts this week announced that its six highest-polluting
power plants will voluntarily upgrade their pollution control technology to
not only significantly reduce air pollution but to also put the old
facilities under the same standards as new facilities.

     The action makes Massachusetts the first state to require older
plants to meet the same emissions standards as new facilities. The reduced
emissions will be in place as soon as 2003, according to Massachusetts
Governor Paul Cellucci's (R) office.

     The state approached the six plants and asked them to either reduce
their emissions or face regulatory action by the Department of
Environmental Protection. Cellucci said, "We challenged these power plants
to clean up their act, and they have answered our call to meet the most
comprehensive air emissions standards in the United States."

     The agreement -- which the five operators of the six plants agreed
to with the state -- is voluntary, but enforceable rules will follow.

     Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift explained that the agreement
resulted through "cooperative efforts," but added, "We will pursue new
regulations through the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure
the plant owners' commitments are enforceable, and will require the
finalization of a detailed plan for each of the six facilities."

     The regulations, which are expected to be proposed in the next few
months -- will set standards of 1.5 ponds of nitrogen oxide and 3 pounds of
sulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour.

     The five companies -- including Sithe Energies, Inc., NRG Energy
Inc., PE&E, Western Massachusetts Electric Companies/ Northeast Utilities,
and Southern Company/Southern Energy New England, LLC -- have submitted
preliminary plans. Under the plans, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions would be slashed by up to 50 percent, and mercury, particulate
and carbon dioxide pollution would be curbed.

     "Our Air Quality Improvement Plan demonstrates that environmental
excellence works in today's competitive market," said James McGowan, senior
vice president of Sithe. "This is a win-win program that will produce the
best power plant for Sithe, the local communities and the environment as a
whole."

     The statement counters many other utilities' position on the issue,
particularly the Midwestern coal-fired plants subject to a massive EPA
enforcement action initiated late last year to have the facilities use
upgraded pollution control technology. Specifically, the lawsuit charges
the utilities with noncompliance with New Source Review requirements of the
Clean Air Act.

     The Massachusetts situation "does undercut the arguments of
dirtier, Midwestern companies that claim it can't be done," said Frank
O'Donnell, with Clean Air Trust.

     Pat Hemlepp, spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of the
utilities involved in the EPA lawsuit, argued, however, "that is like
comparing apples to oranges."

     Though Northeastern states blame the Midwest for pollution
migrating in their air, Hemlepp explained that since there are no serious
problems with non-attainment with CAA regulation in the Midwest, stricter
controls on utilities operating in that part of the country are
unnecessary. "States like Massachusetts have every right to go in and ask
utilities within their state to upgrade. There are major non-attainment
problems in the Northeast, so it makes sense," Hemlepp argued.

     And about EPA's lawsuit, "What people overlook is that EPA's
lawsuit is not about emissions, it's about what is and isn't legal under
the Clean Air Act. ... We feel very strongly that what we've done is
legal," Hemlepp said.

Utilities Secretly Lobbied Congress; Electric Firms Gave Millions to
Left and Right to Halt Deregulation
John Mintz

05/11/2000
The Washington Post
FINAL
A01
Copyright 2000, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

  Some of the nation's largest electric utilities have secretly
funneled millions of dollars through two front groups--one headed by
well-known conservative leaders to appeal to Republicans, the other
affiliated with unions--to stop Congress from deregulating their
industry.

  The campaign, which at times was run out of the offices of the
utilities' CEOs, was so secret that some Washington lobbyists for
these same companies were kept in the dark about many of its
activities, according to documents stamped "confidential" by the
effort's organizers.
  The documents offer an inside view of the industry's
clandestine efforts to wage its political battle through newly minted
entities with innocuous-sounding names. While the use of such groups
has become a common device in lobbying campaigns, it is rare to obtain
a detailed operator's manual for such an effort, complete with candid
assessments of individual lawmakers' vulnerabilities and specific
budgets for waging grass-roots campaigns in their districts.

  Although the two groups--the conservative Citizens for State
Power and the liberal Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance--have
advertised heavily against deregulation, until now only those involved
in the effort knew the organizations were the creation of the same
network of utilities. This network believed using seemingly
independent surrogates made their case more believable and shielded
them from political risk.

  A 1998 memo said the utilities ran the groups in an
arm's-length way described as "discreet, guarded and highly
confidential. . . . Fear of congressional reprisals conditioned this
style. . . . It would be prudent to avoid rash openness."

  Their ongoing "grass roots" lobbying campaign was designed to
influence members of Congress by whipping up hometown ferment with
radio ads directing listeners to call "1-800-BAD-BILL" and telephone
banks wired to connect angry home district residents to congressional
offices.

  The goal of the operation, on which the utilities spent $17
million over the last 3 1/2 years, was to bottle up legislation in a
single congressional panel, the House Commerce Committee's energy and
power subcommittee.

  The utilities' stealth campaign is one reason energy
deregulation legislation has been stalled, although last fall one
partial deregulation bill was reported to the full committee. Commerce
Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) is a staunch industry critic
determined to move a bill.

  The documents describe meetings in Washington steak houses such
as Sam & Harry's where utility lobbyists and consultants shaped
strategies for stopping Bliley. The dozen or so participants in the
operation--who called their effort "The Project"--address each other
in the memos with the kind of blunt talk that isn't often found in
civics textbooks.

  "The trendline is ominous in that a spirit of accommodation and
compromise is definitely taking hold," said one document in 1998, when
the utilities feared Bliley was winning over committee colleagues.
"The number one goal of 'The Project' has always been to bottleneck
legislation."

  The participants speak of the need to "demonize" the federal
agency that regulates utilities and to use debates about nuclear power
as "a highly provocative wedge issue" to destabilize legislative
adversaries.

  The memos were given to The Washington Post by deregulation
advocates, and participants in "The Project" confirmed their
authenticity.

  The effort has outraged some congressional advocates of power
deregulation. Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.)--whom the conservative
front group, Citizens for State Power, attacked in home district radio
ads last year--said it is "bogus" for a group to claim the
conservative mantle by protecting big utilities.

  "They're wearing a conservative hat, but they ought to be
wearing a profit-making hat," said Largent. "The best interest of
conservatives is to create competition."

  Citizens for State Power (CSP) is headed by two leading lights
of the conservative movement--anti-tax and Republican activist Grover
Norquist, and David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative
Union--and is run day-to-day by a veteran GOP operative, Craig
Shirley. It denied for years that it took industry funds, but in
recent years acknowledged taking some such money while offering no
details.

  The Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance (EUSA) also was
created by utility funds, with the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers kicking in small sums. It acknowledged some of its
utility backers a few years ago but uses populist language to argue
that federal deregulation would cause layoffs and hurt mom-and-pop
utility shareholders.

  The documents detail how the Washington political consultants
who run "The Project" call into action one or another of these two
groups depending on circumstances. They used the right-leaning CSP to
broadcast ads criticizing Largent in his conservative Tulsa district
and employed the more liberal EUSA to air commercials against Rep.
Rick White (R-Wash.), who a year later lost his seat representing a
more moderate Seattle district.

  In its effort to stymie federal deregulation, "The Project" at
times argued both sides of an issue before different audiences. Its
participants told environmentally minded legislators that various
deregulation bills weren't aggressive enough in reducing utility
pollution but dispatched others to argue to pro-business members that
Congress should not threaten deep emissions cuts.

  While energy deregulation is an arcane concept to the public,
it is an extraordinarily high-stakes struggle for the nation's $300
billion-a-year power industry. The battle pits investor-owned
utilities against large manufacturers that want cheap power and
independent power companies, such as Enron Corp., that want to compete
with utilities. For one House Commerce subcommittee markup last year,
lobbying firms paid temp workers to wait in line outside the hearing
room for two days so the firms would have seats at the markup.

  Most investor-owned utilities don't want the federal government
to deregulate their businesses and introduce competition. These
utilities say that if need be, they prefer that state legislatures and
state utilities commissions do the job because they are less
heavy-handed than federal officials. So far 26 states have taken the
step.

  Deregulation advocates say that the state efforts result in a
confusing regulatory checkerboard and that federal action would lower
energy prices and encourage investment in clean energy sources.

  Many top GOP leaders were eager to deregulate utilities when
they took over Congress in 1995, seeing it as a test of a bedrock
conservative principle: opening the marketplace to competition.

  Within months, a group of utilities sprang into action,
organized by a law firm with a thriving utility practice. The firm,
which now goes by the name Ryan, Phillips, Utrecht & MacKinnon,
enlisted several existing clients and, later, numerous other firms.

  Soon, the firm had brought in nine utilities that paid from
$300,000 to $700,000 a year to fund "The Project" during the years
they participated. The main corporate participants, the documents
said, were Carolina Power & Light, Florida Power & Light, Texas
Utilities, Illinois-based Commonwealth Edison, Reliant Energy
(formerly called Houston Industries), Ohio-based First Energy,
Michigan-based Consumers Energy, Florida-based TECO and Union Electric
Co. in Missouri.

  "The Project" was run by law firm partner Jeffrey MacKinnon, a
former top aide to Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the House
subcommittee; and Tim Ridley, a former Democratic staff member in
Congress who now runs a firm specializing in "grass roots" lobbying
campaigns.

  They and the utilities ran the two front groups and supervised
more than 50 "mobilizations" in congressional districts, in which
radio aids were aired. Banks of trained telephone operators arranged
for home district residents to send telegrams or place calls to
congressional offices. The groups also arranged for influential
citizens in the members' home towns to spread their message--including
the car dealers who sold members their cars.

  While most of the ads were not particularly negative, others
used sarcasm or debatable statistics to attack their targets.

  The one broadcast against Largent said he was favoring "Boston,
bureaucrats and biomass" because the House member had joined with Rep.
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a measure that industry officials said
could have required utilities to use alternative energy sources. A
memo from late 1998, six months before the campaign, gave a taste of
the utilities' displeasure with him, describing the firms as "highly
alarmed by Largent's obtuseness" and noting they "could make Largent's
life very uncomfortable."  Some congressional Republicans hold Citizens
for State Power
partially responsible for defeating White, who lost his swing seat to
a Democrat, Jay Inslee. A year before the November 1998 election, the
group aired an ad saying White wanted to raise utility rates by 35
percent, and it also circulated a poll and memo among political
professionals showing that White would be beaten easily, in part
because of his embrace of deregulation.

  "For the first time in this debate there were palpable
political consequences for appearing to support" deregulation, a June
1998 document said. "In the case of Rick White, those consequences
were direct and career threatening."

  White said he doubted the ads played much role in his defeat,
but he recalls his unease at realizing a GOP group was targeting him.

  "I was a loyal member of the Republican cause, and this was a
case of shooting a friend in the foot," he said.

Sounds good - I think you have a great opportunity in this market - I would 
suggest staffing aggressively in order to take the first mover advantage.  I

Dave, I missed one point regarding the Toronto trader. Lavorato and Belden 
have identified an associate and he's interested in coming to Toronto. He is 
in Toronto today meeting with DeVries. As a sidebar, our new office space in 
Toronto is extremely impressive (cost was Cdn $500K) and is a great selling 
feature. Hopefully this puts the trading associate "over the top".

Dave, thanks for the note. Regarding an update for Toronto, we made an offer 
to a senior industrial marketer yesterday  (Jeff Borg - 10 years experience) 
while I was in Toronto. I believe that he will accept. In addition, Paul is 
interviewing for one more deal maker (targeting John Guerro at Duke - an 
industrial gas marketer) and a manager for ENERconnect   (has interviewed a 
couple - meeting with Doug Jones from TD Bank next week). 

Scott Gilbert who is running our volume management is out recruiting for 
backoffice staff (needs 5 specialists). No success here as of yet.

Mark Haedicke, Peter Keohane and myself are working on transferring Chris 
Gaffney (Canadian Lawyer) to work in Toronto. Chris is interested and both 
Mark and myself think it would be a good fit/career move.

Dawn, Paul and myself are devising a more aggressive recruiting strategy for 
Toronto for both Paul's and Scott's groups as our presence in Toronto is 
limited. This may include full page ads in the Globe, use of head hunters 
and/or Super Saturdays. With 2 million people in Toronto, we should be having 
more success in recruiting high quality individuals.

It is my understanding that 94 new analysts are starting this August in 
Houston. I need a minimum of 5 (2 for Toronto, 3 for Calgary). I have asked 
Dawn to make this happen, but if there is any way that you can exercise your 
influence to assist in making this happen, that would be much appreciated.

Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on 
whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale 
businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.  
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this 
needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the 
first world is out this week.  I ask for your patience.  

Lets discuss.

As you are undoubtedly more familiar with these firms, you may, or may not, 
think these companies work for the product (we have not tested the 
assumption) but can offer some joint marketing support.  Many of these firms 
have sites accross the continent and it is important to portfolio effect 
their assets to make the transaction work.  We have done  dozens of 
presentations and would propose we put our heads together to determine if 
there is a business opportunity in your market.  

Let me know what you think of the list and which approach makes most sense 
for you.  Jim

used.

That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked 
hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we 
took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant 
real value. Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI 
incorporate the write downs we think should occur?

Regards
Delainey

Dave, I assume you are asking how we hedge the portion of JEDI II investments 
that will come back to us after the restructuring. As any buyout price for 
CALPERS will reflect the state of the assets at closing, I think we are well 
hedged until the closing of the restructuring. We can see if we can reserve 
some Raptor capacity upfront to hege us moving forward from the restructuring 
closin. If this does not answer your question, let me know.    Mike

The total depreciation plan number for west trading is $278,000.  Here is the 
general breakdown

    Net Book Value  Planned Amount  Depreciation Period
Floor Buildouts   $462,000  $135,000   3 to 5 years
PC's and Monitors  $214,000  $50,000    3 years
Large Plasma Screens  $77,000   $46,000    3 years
Other    $25,000   $7,000    3 years
2001 Increase      $40,000 

Total    $778,000  $278,000

Here is the headcount breakdown:

   Current   2001 Plan  Change  Realistically
Trading   41   48   +7  +5   (2 RT, 2 analysts on desk, 1 admin.)
Mid Mkt & Svcs  9   12   +3  +1 or +2  (increase coverage)
Fundamentals  7   9   +2  +1   (supply person with hydro knowledge)
Structuring  0   0   0  +2   (group is 4 -- Chris planned half, I need to 
plan for half)

Totals   57   69   +12  +9 or +10

It looks like my number is two or three too high.  We also had a mixup on 
planning for the existing structuring group.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Also,  I need to talk to you about the City of Vernon.  I want to sue them.  
Several months ago they flaked on a purchase that has cost us about 
$10,000,0000.  Richard Sanders has done the basic legwork and it looks like 
we have a decent case.  I talked to Chris about it, and we both agree that it 
doesn't hurt the west business if we poke them in the eye.  They are not well 
liked in the muni community out here, so the collateral damage should be 
minimal.  The big question is how will this appear in the face of all of the 
ongoing investigations?  Perhaps we should set up a call with me, you, Lavo, 
Sanders, Calger, and Kean?  Let me know your thoughts.

Sherri,

We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently 
working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract 
terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to 
EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some 
real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide 
power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of 
other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off 
balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case 
we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence.

Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a 
particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our 
biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us.

Vicki, how much $$ are we talking about for the bankruptcy and the class 
action suit? It does not seem inappropriate for us to share the bankruptcy 
costs given the CTC issue.  I agree with you on the class action suit.  Lets 
discuss further before we approach ENA.

Regards
Delainey
I would like some guidance about  outside counsel fees related to the 
California situation.  We ( EES and ENA) retained joint counsel in early 
January. As you may recall, in January a substantial amount of work was done 
with the attempted rescue effort by the US Department of Treasury, and the  
managing down of the trading positions with PG&E's unregulated entity.  

I would say that  EES and ENA have used this counsel relatively equally, and 
it would not be inappropriate to split the bills on a  50/50 basis.  However, 
there are two other issues that we should consider: (a) on an overall basis, 
I would say that ENA will have more  issues  that will come out of the 
bankruptcy, and (b) certainly, they will be easier able to absorb as  a 
company  the increased legal expenses.  

Please let me know whether we should go forward with the 50/50 arrangement or 
whether we should adopt another approach.

One other fact:  We also have joint representation in the class action 
lawsuits filed against the power marketers.  To date, no sharing  has been 
agreed to, based on EES' position that in is improperly named in the lawsuit 
(i.e., it is not a participant in the wholesale markets and did not  benefit 
from the  volatility this summer).

Kay, are we in London during this event?

organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=

Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=

=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=

Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=

enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =

The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=

I spoke with Bob Hermann this afternoon and, in short, the single biggest 
contributor to the increase in the corporate tax allocation relates to the 
expansion of state and local tax support being provided to our new "business 
verticals" - that is, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and 
Enron Net Works - which expense should be specifically allocated to such 
groups rather than ENA, as is currently the case.  I will follow up with you 
regarding the revised number after I have resolved the allocation issue.  
Best regards.  Steve. 

David W Delainey
11/10/2000 12:53 PM
Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.

Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day 
deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John 
about this?  I am supportive of this proposal and approach.  Like our 
discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of 
this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.  We also 
have to support Lay's efforts in California.

Dave,

I just spoke with Freeman to let him know that we can provide him a letter 
proposal which I can send out Monday.  In general, we will offer 50MW NP-15 
Peak from February 22 - March 31 at a fixed price (currently $265) with 
payment due every 7 days.  This would be documented under the form of EEI 
that they have agreed to and is subject to (i) payment of outstanding amounts 
due Enron; (ii) execution of EEI and confirm; (iii) confirmation that they 
will pay the amounts due; (iv) good faith obligation to put together 
creidtworthy structure; (v) good faith look at term deal which can be 
back-dated to blend with this current deal, Pastoria and Demand Management.  

It took some time to nail down the settlement numbers on our side.  Legal 
spent some time with Freeman's attorney but got agreement on the EEI Form.  
Credit likes this a lot.    Tim will have Lavo wear the market exposure - 
$2MM if the market falls $100.  David Freeman said he would look at it Monday 
but it sounded good.  

I will pull it together and copy you over the weekend.

Chris

Ken, fyi

By the way, JCP is being restructured or killed.

David, I'm not sure there is any value to this for EES North America. There 
are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back 
and risk offices of the company.  We are working quickly to rectify  - 
servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.  On the European 
side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.

Regards
Delainehy
No doubt you will have heard of this initiative - a program of "surprise" 
quick controls reviews at various business units. 
There are two such reviews coming up in March in relation to EES (London and 
Houston), where I suspect the element of surprise would be outweighed by 
having some good early input to the scope.

Let me know your thoughts.

Rgds
DP

Shawn, just a little buried - why don't you come by on Monday. Kay please 
schedule.

Regards
Delainey

Joe, I will forward his voice mail to you.  EES has enough challenges in NA 
and Europe before tackling retail products and services in a market with no 
wholesale market.

Please follow up.

Thanks
Delainey

Thanks for the quick response, Joe.  Peter did call me earlier this 
afternoon, and I transferred him to Dave Delainey.  Unfortunately, I failed 
to get his phone number before transferring him, but I understand from Dave's 
assistant that he left Dave a voicemail.  I'm sure he left his number there.  
I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 
buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and 
have +/- 100 additional properties they manage.

I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything 
further you need me to do.  Good luck - I hope it's a real deal - I've never 
had origination next to my name before!  SRS

Sherri,

We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently 
working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract 
terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to 
EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some 
real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide 
power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of 
other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off 
balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case 
we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence.

Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a 
particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our 
biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us.

Gentlemen,

You will receive a phone call from Peter Wachtell sometime over the next 
week.  I spoke to his father last night at a dinner party; Peter is putting 
together a deal in Tokyo right now to purchase 50 office buildings and manage 
another 100.  He is interested in talking to Enron about energy outsourcing.

I'm assured that this a legitimate deal, but that will be for you to decide!  
Just wanted to give you a heads up in the hopes you will take a few minutes 
to talk to him.

Dave,

A DASH will be circulating later today for approximately $16MM for $10MM of 
progress payments on a 7FA and certain development costs for our Longview 
Project.  Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to 
get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued 
use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for 
some reason.  Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the 
money using Enron mid curves for gas and power.  

Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with 
GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed 
tomorrow.
I am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $15MM-$20MM.   

I was planning to talk with Louise about this at our call this morning.  Are 
you or she the appropriate signor for EA?  I will also contact Mark Frevert 
early this afternoon to discuss.   

Regards,

Chris

Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give 
you a call to discuss further.

Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:

 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.

PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.

Talk to you soon!!

It would be really great for you to do that.  Unfortunately we start at 
10.30am UK / 4.30am US time (the only slot we could get for the Auditorium).  
It won't be as cool as a video link up, but if you give me a text message 
addressed to all European staff, I'll read it out.

I'll get the senior guys together on Monday for the weekly EES 2.30pm UK / 
8.30am US video conference call so you and Janet can at least speak to them.

Let's get you and Janet over to Europe to meet and greet the troops in person

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Matthew, if you know my reputation, I tend not to be a big fan of these type 
of events either - however, at this point, I need to collect more information 
on the event and I think it inappropriate to cancel at this late stage.  
Going forward, I think we as a management team including yourself should 
discuss what the strategy should be going forward.

Don't hesitate to voice your opinion.

Delainey

Dave/Janet,

As you guys like a no bullshit approach, last Fall, I voiced my concerns to 
the EES management team about the second Pinnacle event (see link below).

http://pinnacle2001.proghq.com/index.html

My concerns in no particular order were:

1) Given that we have a generous bonus programme to reward staff, I felt the 
need for such an over the top event like an all expenses paid holiday in the 
West Indies for "key" staff and their spouses was unnecessary.
2) The lack of transparent selection criteria ("selected Superior and 
Excellent performers") was devisive would inevitably piss off the vast 
majority of EES who didn't go on the trip.
3) Apart from disagreeing with the whole idea, I disagreed with the fact that 
all the MDs automatically got to go as that implied they were all performing 
and deserved it.
4) I didn't believe that, overall, the business was making enough money to 
justify a "reward"  trip like this.
5) I didn't want to take my best guys out of the office for up to a week as 
we have a lot of work to do and won't make the numbers sat on a beach
6) The Europe wide Enron team works well together and there would be no way 
of justifying this trip to the rest of the London office (non EES) who 
obviously would see it for what it is - a waste of time and money

Tom conceded by saying that this one would probably be the last event of its 
kind.  Others remained silent.

I withdrew Europe from the event on the grounds that culturally in Europe 
this event was unacceptable.  Stephen Peterson (in the Europe team)  appears 
on the list of attendees, but will not attend for the reasons outlined above 
and he is OK with it.  Afterwards, I found out that McCarty boycotted the 
first event the year before for the same reasons.

Whatever you guys decide to do, Europe remains committed to hitting the 
numbers and being part of the team.

Hey Crystal hope things are well ....

Dawna is fine. We have two girls six (Kassandra) and four (Samantha).  We 
have been in Houston now three and half years.  It has been a good move from 
a career point of view.  Obviously, you had heard my move from Pres./CEO of 
I hope life has been as kind to you.  Best of luck in the future.

Hi Dave,

I have just returned back to work and noticed your name in one of the Enron 
org change announcements.  Congratulations!  Is it fun ruling the universe??  
Does this mean that you don't plan on becoming a professor in the near 
future?!?  Life in Calgary must seem very far away...  

I hope that you and Donna are doing well in Houston.  How many children do 
you have now?  Is Donna working, or enjoying life at home?

I am doing well.  I am located in Oxford, and work part time at Enron 
Direct.  I have a 17 month old daughter who keeps me busy when I'm not at 
work.  Life is good in England.  Hard to believe that 5 years has flown by 
since I left Calgary.

I hope that all is well with you.

Crystal

Mike, please let Brian know if there is a problem and let him rectify.  It is 
difficult for me to be responsive otherwise.

It turns out that Delainey agreed to allow Brett Wiggs to be the Enron

I'm personally not in love with the Mitsubishi turbines anyway given the NOx 
uncertainty.

Detailed description:

Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give 
you a call to discuss further.

Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:

 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.

PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.

Talk to you soon!!

Delainey

It would be really great for you to do that.  Unfortunately we start at 
10.30am UK / 4.30am US time (the only slot we could get for the Auditorium).  
It won't be as cool as a video link up, but if you give me a text message 
addressed to all European staff, I'll read it out.

I'll get the senior guys together on Monday for the weekly EES 2.30pm UK / 
8.30am US video conference call so you and Janet can at least speak to them.

Let's get you and Janet over to Europe to meet and greet the troops in person 
later in the year when you guys realise what you have taken on!

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Richard, it is my understanding that this investment is currently in Ray 
Bowen's business.  In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in 
taking on that responsibility.  In my EES shoes, I would like to take a 
closer look at the possible connections.  Please send me some info on the 
investment fund and their current investments portfolio.

I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on 
the Catalytica investment.  With my EES shoes on, no way!!!!

Richard Lydecker@ENRON
02/07/2001 09:01 AM
The kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now 
provided by EES.  While they are happy to exploit any opportunity, their 
business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this 
kind of deal.  In short, they have no interest in picking up the commitment 
(and capital employed) via an intercompany transfer.

Private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the 
normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years.  The Heartland partnership 
has a 10-year life,  Enron did negotiate the right to sell its LP interest 
after 3 years.  As a practical matter, that right guarantees neither a fair 
price or even a market.

There is no logical home for this investment that I know of in ENA except in 
my portfolio.  Question: is this an ENA responsibility or would it move to 
EIM's balance sheet?  If we (ENA) have no choice but to retain the 
investment, my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to 
monetize funds invested to-date (about $6 million) and sell the remaining 
commitment.  Since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership 
interests, however, it will be extremely difficult to get out of our 
investment/commitment in the foreseeable future.  Under any circumstances 
finding a buyer will be time-consuming and expensive.  (This is a poster 
child for "patient" investment capital).

I want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is 
that the obligation should be transferred to EIM which I believe has assumed 
the charter of the ENA group that formerly managed this investment.  Dick.  

Scott, I appreciate your note and I am sure that you will work well with 
Chris.  I have always believed in your talents and capabilities - I won't be 
far ....

Regards
Delainey

Congratulations on the new position!   I guess they thought that double or 
tripling your budget wasn't a big enough challenge for you!  Best wishes, I 
am sure you will be successful.  ENA won't seem the same without you.

I want to thank you about your advice on Calger.  He is great to work for.  I 
am starting to crank again, just like 1998 (still my most enjoyable year at 
Enron)

Good luck! 

Ed, thanks for the note - hope things are going well.

Regards
Delainey

Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.  I 
assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial 
change; however, I take full responsibility.  I will guarantee it won't 
happen again.  My understanding is that you have been a significant 
contributor to EES strategy and success.  You can count on a lot more 
discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you 
will be leading a market opportunity.  I have asked Kay to set up some time 
for us to discuss the market and the future next week.  If that is not soon 
enough, I am around all day today.

Dave,

I am sending this in response to your query regarding the slow payment from 
Wheeling Pittsburgh.  Wheeling Pittsburgh has allegedly filed bankruptcy some 
time last week.  Legal is trying to obtain the bankruptcy filing we are 
beginning to solidfy our potential claim.   Our current exposure is 
approximately $1.55mm ($1.07mm in receivable and $375k MTM).  We are working 
with the steel team (the deal was orginated by Tammy Mulrooney) and legal to 
determine our rights under our contract.  We will keep you posted with any 
updates.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Bill

thxs Chris - look forward to working with you again.

Delainey

Mark, thanks for the note - look forward to working with you - you did a 
great job for me in ENA, I'm sure that will continue.

As a shareholder I am extremely happy that you are heading over to EES.  
There is a business there.  They just need some help with the execution and 
implementation.  

I'm sorry to see you leave ENA.  The management style that you and John have 
brought to this organization is the best I've seen.  The attention to details 
and teamwork are really impressive.  Personally, I want to say thanks for all 
of the support that you have provided to me and the West Power Team over the 
last year.  Everything from acknowledging our suceessful business model to 
helping us to refine it through improved metrics in the middle market to 
supporting me and my guys through the PRC process has been greatly 
appreciated!

With EES' large position in the west I'm sure we will be working together in 
the future.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do to help.  Good 
luck.

Tim

 - Tex Mex (ERCOT to Mexico transmission line with term PPA with Desarco)
 - Ahlstrom (QF Purchase)
 - CRRA/Fuel Cell Energy (fuel cell deal with Conn. regulators)
 - sale of Pastoria and LV Cogen (assume not)
 - sale of ECP (assume not)
 - sale of HPL (assume not).

b - as above. Several have gone across wholesale already. stats will show 
this and progress on others.
c - Fair to say we have total clarity of direction here now! All memo's will 
be out by Monday, Cindy Olson has sent an email to HR community (re Embargo 
on HPL staff) and I believe Mark H is drafting something for other OTC's.

CDWR is proposing to all potential suppliers the following security package 
for new PPA's:

1) Irrevocable PUC Order / Agreement that "locks in the revenue stream" for 
CDWR to cover the PPA costs.

2) PPA covenant that the power supplier has payment priority over any debt, 
including the contemplated debt issue
  - the concept is that the supply is the operating cost and any debt would 
be subordinate

3) PPA Covenant that their is a uniform package to all suppliers; no more 
favorable terms or priority to ayone, no L/C, etc.

Subject to definitive language, CDWR is trying to get people to buy into this 
general plan.  What do people think?  Please try to shoot holes in this.  
Please forward to the appropriate legal, regulatory and credit folks to air 
this out.

Thanks,

commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Dave,

Here is PGE's response to the question you raised about how its plans to 
cover its short position in '02 and beyond.  Part of Pamela's response does 
not make sense to me and I will follow up with her for additional details.

Let me know if you have additional questions.

Hi, Mitch!  As of today, Oregon is sill moving forward with our version of
open access.  As you may recall, this is a fairly consevative approach.  Only
non-residential customers are eligible for direct access.  Utilities need not
sell any generating resources.  We will use a technique called "ongoing
valuation" to allow non-residentials to elect other suppliers while still
receiving the benefits/paying the costs of our current supplies.  We are
planning to be in balance (or long) for 2002 on a full load basis.  Thus,
while non-residential customers may elect new suppliers, they are essentially
fully hedged with our portfolio of long- and short-term supplies.  We have
also begun to raise the question for discussion whether we should fill a full
load position for years beyond 2002.  Those discussions will probably continue
the next couple of months.  One possible outcome is that we would fill all of
our load except perhaps customers over 1-5 MWs.  They would have the right to
"opt-out" by giving us notice 1/1/02 not to plan for them beginning 1/1/03. 
Then, the Commission might phase in this option for consecutively smaller load
customers on a set schedule.  This would allow us some certainty and ability
to make longer-term commitments and also give the market some certainty about
what load might be available when.  Everyone is well-aware of our short
position and the implications of that.  We are seeking an amendment to
Oregon's restructuring law that would eliminate any date restriction on our
ability to treat resource commitments as eligible for transition treatment.  I
think this is a critical piece to ensuring that Oregon doesn't set up a cliff
like California did or Nevada appears to be doing.  All this being said,
whether Oregon's restructuring moves forward is ultimately an
emotional/political issue.  Bad news, even if unrelated to direct access,
could spook the Legislature enough to give momentum to the several bills
already introduced to delay/reverse it.  We will keep you informed. 
Meanwhile, our power supply folks are proceeding as if we will need to plan
for almost everyone indefinitely.

Jim, 

In the resource plan that you sent me earlier this week, you indicated that 
PGE was short anywhere from 400 to 700 MW, going out to 2006. What 
sentiment are you hearing in Oregon about open accesss? (In Nevada, where 
I have been focused of late, the drums are beating louder for longer 
delays). If open access (customer choice) is deferred beyond this year, 
how do you plan to cover this short position, especially in '02? Does the 
OPUC appreciate that you are short in anticipation of open access? 

Thanks, 

Mitch

John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks 
into his central Technical Services group.  These folks would continue to 
work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the 
centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors 
including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican 
business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development 
risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.

Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES

in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination 
organizations."

I made one adjustment - Pastoria offer is $58.80.

FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.  I believe that 
discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his 
staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.  In 
the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in 
their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for 
the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their 
advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a 
transaction.

 The proposal includes:
  a) traded power products of various sizes and terms;
  b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) 
for term;
  c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide 
gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts;
  and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.

Guys, as a follow on to our discussion last week:

 a) run the RFP for VN service for Electro - variety of terms, volumes  as 
per our discussion - next thirty days - Orlando;
 b) explore the possibility of adding four additional LM's to the Electrobolt 
structure as a form of generation mitigation for the Electro short - would 
Petrobras be open to this discussion and what would be the last date that we 
would have to call NTP to get in on time to make 2003 - Joe;
 c) as much information on the nature of the Electro short and any customer 
contractual positions that can be provided to Lavo to start estimating the 
value  of the possible straddle - Orlando
 d) re-run the Cuiba MTM model given changing cost parameters, fuel issues 
and timing to determine what the possible hit may be and what are the 
mitigants - Joe;
 e) re-run budget numbers with correct view on re-organization costs - Joe;
 f) view on financial budget and strategic goals for 2001 and feedback to ESA 
- Lavo/Delainey;
 g) update commercial org chart reflecting discussions about the origination 
teams - Joe;
 and h) clarification on sale and asset responsibility in SA on a go forward 
basis given changing opinions on effectiveness of current organization - Lavo.

Outsourcing contacts:
 a) PetroCanada/Suncor - Eric LeDain
 b) Peoples Gas  - Laura Luce
 c) Virginia Natural Gas - Ed McMichael
 d) Brooklyn Union - Ed McMichael

Dave --

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I 
wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed 
via a few initiatives, including:

1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the 
direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year)
2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up
3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend
4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have 
been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting)

There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but 
this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy 
to sit down and discuss this with you.

Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a

Congratulations ( I think?) on your new assignment.

If you get a chance in the next few days, drive by this building I have.  It 
is at 5205 Spruce (2 blocks north of Bellaire Blvd and 2 blocks west of Rice) 
in Bellaire.  It  is a great building for what you need for your cars.  It 
will lease for about $12-$15/sf annually (about 5000 sf including the garage 
space) and I have about $750,000 in the building.  If you have 1/3 of the 
building (+-$250,000) it will cost you about $1,600/mo in interest.  This is 
about what it would cost to put your 3 cars in a climate controlled storage 
space (probably less) at a USTOREIT.  Let me know if you're interested in 
looking at a deal structure.

  Location: EB 3321

  Topic:  California Update

  
Please let me know if you have any questions or conflicts.

Thanks,

Kay   3-0643

Guys, can you start working on your presentations for the offsite.  

Dave I would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that 
you are working on for the IPP market which should be able to source short 
and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable(?) on the capital 
side.  Go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities. 
It may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of 
coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas 
markets and a quick view of the development process. How should we 
participate in this market?  Gasification technology?

Jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation 
sector ie) the technologies, the users, the VC's, etc.  Specifically, how 
will these technologies change our business model and the overall power 
business model?  How are we positioning ourselves in this market?  What is 
the PI strategy with this regard? 

Dorie Hitchcock and Tammy Sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; 
however, we need a first cut by December 8th.

Thanks
Delainey

Guys, do we have enough VAR to bring this position into the book?  If over 
$5M in total exposure it has to go to Frevert/Whalley.

John, thanks for the update. I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis 
this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current 
terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent 
that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK 
with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. 
This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated 
acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure 
that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on 
point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please 
ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available 
to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of 
days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all 
internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of 
you if he needs to.  

Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to 
"Regional Management" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and 
Trading. 

Thanks and good luck!

All:

As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with 
Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their 
wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in 
the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are 
currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.  
They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, 
there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items 
and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the 
negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an 
example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine 
PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract 
within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm 
pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for 
about 2-3 hours).

Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:

Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood
Legal:  Janice Moore
Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti
Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson
Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo

Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items 
subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is 
prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a 
chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 
28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you 
all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move

CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on

Dan, sounds like we are moving backwards - but these guys tend to jump the 
gun at times.  If it is not possible for these orgs to work together lets not 
try and force them (ie) we will manage our own business and contract with 
NEPCO when and if it makes sense.

Dave,

Yes,  I've got these set up.

On a separate topic, I received a visit from D. Liebert (working for Dan L. 
on EE&CC) to discuss the memo I sent out on the Tech Services Group.    
During the discussion we identified several areas where EES' view diverges 
from the view in my memo that ENA will manage its own technical risk and will 
be supported by EE&CC.      Currently, EES is headed in the following 
direction:

1. EE&CC will manage all technical risk in Enron as part of a consolidated 
technical risk book. 
2. EE&CC will be the sign off on all DASH's with respect to technical risk.
3. EE&CC is still trying to work out how their services will be charged to 
the business units - not sure what "cost" is.

This central decision is (1.) above.  If EES is going to manage ENA's 
technical risk then the balance between managing engineering cost and 
managing technical risk will be eliminated.  Essentially we will be back to a 
ENA (origination) vs. EE&CC (construction) relationship where we argue about 
how much money they are spending and the amount of overhead that is included 
in their "cost".  Your thoughts on this?

We didn't draw any lines and agreed to keep discussing to make this work.  I 
would suggest that either I can meet with Dan L. to understand his views or 
that we have another joint meeting with you and Dan's team to resolve.

Regards,
Brian

Dave has asked that a Staff Meeting be scheduled for Wednesday February 7, 
2001, from 3:00 pm til 5:00 pm in 30C1.  Please mark your calendar and plan 
to attend.

If you have any questions and/or conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay 
3-0643).

Thanks,

Kay

Janet, if you are ok, I'm ok - we usually only sign these type of 
non-solicitations, stand-stills or non-competes if we are well down the road 
towards having a reasonable probability to completing a transaction with the 
counterparty.  Otherwise, it becomes a nightmare to manage all these.  I will 
leave it to your discretion.

Regards
Delainey
Pursuant to an Interoffice Memorandum from Jim Derrick to all Enron Attorneys 
dated October 27, 1999, I am required to seek approval from each of you prior 
to signing off on a non-solicitation agreement which affects Enron North 
America Corp.  This non-solicitation agreement is being required by Niagara 
Mohawk in order to participate in its request for proposal both to outsource 
the management of its supply portfolio and to provide power to meet its 
"Standard Offer Service" load requirements for a term ending 12/31/06.

The proposed non-solicitation language reads as follows:

Please feel free to contact me at extension 3-7493 if you have any questions 
or comments on the legal side.  If you have questions about the underlying 
commercial transaction, please call either Jeff Ader or Michael Brown.  

Thanks

Stuart

Jeff, I assume that you are doing Lydecker, Maffitt and Detmering's review.

thanks
Dave

These are the reviews that I have completed or nearing completion:

 - Scott Josey
 - Brian Redmond
 - Rob Milnthorp
 - Janet Dietrich
 - Chris Calger
 - John Thompson
 - Max Yzaguirre
 - Jeff Donahue
 - Wes Colwell
 - Kay Chapman

David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of 
reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches 
all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.  I would suggest that we 
follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all 
reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at 
mid-year.  I would shoot for 100% participation target.  How are we making 
out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?

Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.  You 
have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan 
(ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe 
your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for 
questions.

The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good 
understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.

Could you have a first cut by December 8th?

Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.

Regards
Delainey

ok, your call - do we have some spares available if needed?

regards
Delainey

Kevin, the only thing to keep in mind are the patent issues on the DLN - the 
GE settlement prevents PSM from re-manufacturing any further "tainted" 
product including spares for the existing DLN system - how might this affect 
our reliability at peak times?

Regards
Delainey

I'm having Mitch scrub the economics one more time.   In general, however, 
the capital expense is very hard to justify given the fact we ran only 200 
hours last year (1000 hour total permit) and the forward curve suggests we 
will run 300-400 hours per year.

Spending capital $'s for lower CO and NOx is hard to justify when the 
additional run hours are not valued from a trading perspective.

John, what do you want to do with this?  We had discussed but I wanted to 
follow up.

Delainey

Dave --

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I 
wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed 
via a few initiatives, including:

1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the 
direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year)
2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up
3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend
4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have 
been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting)

There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but 
this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy 
to sit down and discuss this with you.

Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a 
meeting, we need to pick a date and get on the Hyatt calendar soon.  Their 
calendar is filling up quickly.  Thanks.

Eric

Attached is a  summary of our test efforts at New Albany.? The new 
combustion  system?performed as expected. We have taken orders from other 
users for the  EA version of the system and will be delivering the first sets 
at the end of the  1st Qtr. The new system would give you 3X the current run 
time at New Albany  & Doyle. Is there any interest in upgrading to the new 
system? I know we  have discussed it in the past.

Hey John. Have you worked out the green card issues with the TXU options

Due to adverse loss experience the insurance market is "hardening" resulting 
in higher rates and more restrictive terms and conditions. Property insurance 
rates are generally rising for everyone and particularly those with poor loss 
experience. Unfortunately, Enron falls in the latter category. In the past, 
not withstanding our loss experience, Enron has enjoyed very competitive 
rates and a deductible of $500,000 for both property damage and business 
interruption (traditionally, property insurance policies contain a monetary 
deductible for property damage plus a day waiting period for business 
interruption (normally 30 to 90 days)).  For the period 1993 through 2000 
Enron paid premiums of approximately $114,100,000 and collected losses of 
approximately $ 212,200.000.  This trend is continuing under the current 
policy which is expiring on 3/1/2001. 

Current renewal terms being offered require an estimated premium of  
$17,000,000 and a deductible of $5,000,000 per loss for property damage and 
business interruption. This is the lowest deductible achievable unless we are 
willing to accept a waiting period for business interruption. 

Realising the potential costs and budgetary and contractual implications 
associated with such a change, we are continuing negotiations and seeking 
alternatives to the current renewal terms. However, we should all be prepared 
for an increase in premiums and the level of loss which we retain through 
deductibles. I will keep you advised as these negotiations progress. 

Please forward this notice to all concerned parties within your group. If 
there are any questions, please give me a call at ext. 36263.

Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada 
and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their 
transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central 
desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to 
Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split 
for the business?

Regards
Delainey
As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment 
with the corresponding trading group, I assumed that Eastern Canada 
origination would fall within the central region.  Specifically opportunities 
with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this 
division and I have no desire to start any new issues or create larger 
organizational issues.   In the gas re-organization, how did you 
strategically divide Eastern Canada?

I would appreciate your direction or decision.

Dave, Pope has been working with the Stampeder organization for the last six 
months on creating a sponsorship package for our Retail business. Our first 
goal was to attempt to get the naming rights to McMahon Stadium (not unlike 
the Canadian Airlines Saddledome, Enron Field, etc.). At this point the 
naming rights are off the table. However, we have the opportunity to grab the 
naming rights to the Labour Day Classic as well as some other season-long 
involvement. Terms of the deal at this point are as follows:

1. "Enron Labor day Classsic" and 100 thirty-second radio spots promoting the 
Enron Labor day Classic + Newspaper Ads
 40,000 Enron logo cheering towels to be distributed pre-game
 Exclusive sponsorship on the cover of the game day program
 Enron logo on the player's jerseys

2. Season long involvement 
 End-Zone advertising
 1 full-page color ad in the Stamp's 2001 yearbook
 12 season tickets
 12 red & white club memberships

Cost would be approx $100K Cdn (still be negotiated). 

In terms of our overall strategy for branding, this is likely the only 
initiative that we would pursue in 2001 as we like that it has good 
penetration for the entire province of Alberta as well as national exposure. 
The Labour day game draws the biggest crowd each season, has been sold out 
eight out the past nine seasons, and is the largest single day sporting event 
in Calgary each year. Last year the "battle of Alberta" attracted over 
750,000 viewers on CBC. The timing is also very good as we will be fully 
functional by September. 

Let me know what you think.

Regards

Rob, if you and Dave think this is your best branding opportunity in the 
short run as we gear up I am supportive.  I assume this will be covered in 
Canada's budget.  Send me a towel.

Attached is the updated exposure report for California.  There are four

affiliate exopsure, 3) CAISO and Cal PX exposure, and 4) Enron business unit 
combined CA exposure.  We are continuing to make progress on the mitigation 
of PG&E non-regulated exposures.  Please give me a call if you have any 
specific questions on the numbers.

Bill 
3-3831

Please note:
The numbers for the PX Credit have increased based on a more complete 
valuation.  
The P/X Credit MTM exposures are not netted against EES payables of T&D (with 
netting there would be an estimated $200mm reduction in PX Credit exposure)
All MTM numbers are valued at the Mid Curves.
Enron Wind numbers are being reviewed.
Portland General, ISO and PX exposures are estimates from last week and need 
to be updated.

Since Randy knows alot about power by wire I guess I under estimated the 
costs/feasibility of my mine mouth strategy. Still seems to make sense to 
promote clean buring coal plants to reduce America's dependence on foreign 
oil or straining a maxed out natural gas system. Is this something we should 
have Tom Briggs in the Enron Washington, DC office push? 
Randal Maffett
01/16/2001 04:58 PM
B'fast Friday looks fine, it's on the calendar!  

Re: the coal strategy, you're exactly right.  There is however one major 
impediment.  While locating the plant near/at the source (i.e., mine-mouth) 
will ease transport costs for coal, there aren't many major coal mines 
located in the prime market zones for power.  The transmission (wires) grid 
was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk trading/transport the way gas does 
and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous (infinitely more so 
than building new plants).  For example, the average lead time to permit (not 
built, just permit) a high-voltage power line is 5-7 years!  As a result, a 
medium sized line (345kv, 200 miles) can cost upwards of $1-2 billion!  That 
was the most frustrating part of the 18 months I chased this stuff.  While 
the basic solutions appear to be so logical, the business (the utilities), 
regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking 
that breaking in was basically impossible.  Unless we're willing to put a 
billion $ at risk for 5-7 years on a merchant basis!  (NOT!)  Hell, you can't 
even get $100 million for your refinery deal!  Solving the power supply 
shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new 
technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas.  But until the FERC and 
state PUCs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more "fungible" 
and integrated transmission system, the utilities will continue to operate in

George,

I'm sure I am way over simplifying this, but in light of current natural gas 
prices and the past success ENA had building six natural gas power plants 
wouldn't the same template work for building coal fired power plants in the 
US? I'm sure the choosing of potential sites and the overall permitting 
process is far more severe than the natural gas process, but it would seem 
Enron could and should be a leader in proposing new coal plants. Wouldn't it 
make sense to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual 
coal supply, whereby we avoid the ever increasing transportation costs and 
then supply power by wire to surrounding states. States rich in coal reserves 
are always looking for more jobs which a new power plant would create and 
therefore may speed the permitting process along. Building the power 
transmission infrastructure across state lines may be cost prohibitive, but 
has this approach been analyzed by the coal group? 

Regards,
Doug

Guys, I am in complete agreement on the strategy.  This has been discussed 
for some time, Dave Duran and his group have distinct goals to move this 
strategy forward in 2001.

Since Randy knows alot about power by wire I guess I under estimated the 
costs/feasibility of my mine mouth strategy. Still seems to make sense to 
promote clean buring coal plants to reduce America's dependence on foreign 
oil or straining a maxed out natural gas system. Is this something we should 
have Tom Briggs in the Enron Washington, DC office push?

B'fast Friday looks fine, it's on the calendar!  

Re: the coal strategy, you're exactly right.  There is however one major 
impediment.  While locating the plant near/at the source (i.e., mine-mouth) 
will ease transport costs for coal, there aren't many major coal mines 
located in the prime market zones for power.  The transmission (wires) grid 
was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk trading/transport the way gas does 
and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous (infinitely more so 
than building new plants).  For example, the average lead time to permit (not 
built, just permit) a high-voltage power line is 5-7 years!  As a result, a 
medium sized line (345kv, 200 miles) can cost upwards of $1-2 billion!  That 
was the most frustrating part of the 18 months I chased this stuff.  While 
the basic solutions appear to be so logical, the business (the utilities), 
regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking 
that breaking in was basically impossible.  Unless we're willing to put a 
billion $ at risk for 5-7 years on a merchant basis!  (NOT!)  Hell, you can't 
even get $100 million for your refinery deal!  Solving the power supply 
shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new 
technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas.  But until the FERC and 
state PUCs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more "fungible" 
and integrated transmission system, the utilities will continue to operate in 
their vacuum as these transmission barriers are the only things protecting 
their turfs.  Even though some have given the appearance of forming 
RTO's/ISO's (regional transmission organizations or independent system 
operators) this is simply a facade of utilities banding together to cover 
each other's asses.  The assets are still owned by the utilities themselves 
and the RTO/ISO has no authority to mandate expansion or anything requiring 
capital investment, other than routine maintenance, etc...  That's the whole

Counterparties affected would be:

  Imperial Holly Corporation
  Holly Sugar Corporation

At the present, we have no trades with either of these counterparties.

Mike, as a policy offsites and retreats, especially more exotic and 
expensive, are being discouraged.  I would prefer the Galveston offsite and I 
don't see a need for more than one per year.  Please manage through PR - 
Dorie Hitchcock - she will  require an agenda as part of the approval 
process.  I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of 
the offsite.  

If you have some concerns lets discuss.

Dave,

As part of my ongoing effort to maintain a high level of morale within the 
group, I would like to undertake a couple of outings during the first half of 
the year.  Given the fact that I now report to you directly and these outings 
will involve spending some money, I don't want to commit to anything before 
reaching agreement with you on the following:

Weekend offsite in Galveston (at Hotel Galvez) in April.  Group dinner on 
Friday, Golf at Galveston Country Club on Saturday morning, meetings and 
beach time during afternoon/evening on Saturday, group deep sea fishing 
outing on Sunday.  Given that the capacity of the boat exceeds the number of 
people in my group, I intend to invite one or more other groups from ENA as a 
way of fostering better communications.  Total cost of the entire weekend 
should not exceed $15,000.00.

Team building exercise on Mt. Hood (Oregon) in July.  Despite my present 
residence in Houston, I previously lived for many years in Europe, including 
4+ years in Switzerland.  During this time, I became an avid mountain 
climber.  I would like to take as many member of my group as are willing to 
climb Mt. Hood (which I have climbed several times - not a huge challenge).  
Given Mt. Hood's proximity to Portland, I would of course combine this with 
half a day spent with Chris Calger and his group (and may even invite them to 
accompany us).  Total cost would be around $450 per person plus 
transportation. 

I would like to go ahead and finalize arrangements for the above unless you 
have strenuous objections.  Please let me know.

MLM

Jean, the $6M was a negotiated settlement between me and Marty Rosenberg of 
several old disputes as we moved forward in the restructuring of the 
Independence plant earlier in the year - Ruth added little other than 
administrative support.

Dear Mr Delainey:

We met in the Associate Orientation last summer when you asked me if I would 
like to join ENA for my first rotation. But since our first rotation was
assigned instead of chosen by ourselves, I was in no position to accept your 
kindly invitation. Now that I am two months away from finishing my
first rotation, I remembered our conversation during the Orientation and was 
more than eager to send you this  email hoping that your invitation is
still open.

I would love to join ENA (EA).  I believe by doing so, I will be given the 
opportunity to work with the smartest people in this industry.
I also believe I am prepared to join the trading unit in ENA.  I have five 
years' experience in Metals trading - both physical and financial. At
business school at UT Austin, I chose Energy Finance as my concentration and 
enjoyed tremendously these courses:

Risk management: Swap, Options, Delta and Vega hedge,...
Financial Strategy for Energy Companies: Financial decisions on investment 
and long-term hedge, ...
Financial Engineering: Case studies on financial products invented by 
Investment banks
Real Option Valuation: Decision making process considering the optionality in 
the future
Energy Law: Regulation and Environment issues in Energy Industry.

All this above and my passion for this industry and Enron  give me confidence 
to explore the opportunity to work in ENA. Only if you could
give me five minutes of your precious time to allow me to prove my 
qualifications, I will greatly appreciate it.

Have another  great year!

Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should 
have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any

Dave and John --

In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt 
in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get 
started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the 
arrangements.  Please advise.

Eric

Guys, in coordination with your trading partners, can you start putting 
together your offsite presentations.  Each group will have approximately one 
hour to one hour and half.  A suggested format would include (for East Power, 
East Gas, West Power, Canada (power and gas), Central Gas and West Gas):
  a) market overview - including supply/demand, structural changes, etc;
  b) strategy and opportunities in 2001(include five new trading/origination 
opportunities for 2001);
  c) expected 2001 new products/structures, coverage and deal flow;
  d) what worked in 2000 what didn't;
  and e) organization and resources - people, assets, constraints, etc.

In a nutshell, we want you to share with the group how your market works, 
where the opportunties lie and how are you positioning yourself to take 
advantage of those opportunties in order to reach your financial and other 
goals in 2001.  

Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy 
lifting; however, they need your first cut by December 8th.

Thanks

intended to be a technical audit, but to provide a vehicle to coordinate 
priorities and spot potential issues before they become problems.

--  PLEASE DISREGARD IF YOU RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM ME ON 1-9-01 (I was 
having trouble with the network in Houston)

Dave,

The attached spreadsheet outlines my recommendations on proposed changes to 
the bonus distribution.

In regard to my expectations, I am expecting a significant increase from last 
years bonus for the following reason.

It was my strategic decision to:
pursue the asset development business in conjunction with other business 
lines (made and received approval to hire the necessary people and execute 
the strategy from Kevin Hannon).
close both Wind and Powder projects simultaneously versus only focus on the 
Powder River Project (know one thought that both could get done in a 7 week 
time frame. At the risk of not being able to get either closed, I went out on 
the limb and sent Whitt to negotiate and close Wind River ($72 MM) while I 
negotiated and closed Powder River ($75 MM).
it was my idea to create Enron Midstream Services and develop a gathering 
business in the Powder. That decision enable us to hedge our firm transport 
decision on Fort Union and enabled us to receive $54 million for the sale of 
the business
I made the  call and initiated the joint bid between Northern Border and ENA 
to acquire a combined 49% interest in Bighorn Gas Gathering.  We sold our 
interest to NBP for $22 MM
I initiated the discussions, structured the transaction, negotiated the value 
and closed Project 20/20 with NBP.  There was a point in the negotiations 
where it was known that I was going with NBP and therefore had to take a 
neutral position.  However, by that time, the value had been established and 
many contentious issues regarding valuation had been agreed upon
it was my call to preserve value in the transaction and have myself and a 
team of 12 others go over to NBP versus have them deduct the cost associated 
with a Management Services Agreement from the purchase price.  This saved ENA 
over $20 MM in value.  Needless to say, we are now having to deal with 
managing a highly aggressive budget and adjust to a very different management 
style and compensation plan. I feel personally that ENA was the primary 
beneficiary of the higher valuation.  As you can appreciate, I have a 
personal issue with this and would like this to be considered for bonus 
determination.

In general, I think Project 20/20 was just part of my contribution to ENA 
during my tenure in Denver.  In total, this office has generated in excess of 
$150 million in earnings with no remaining risk potential.  I have been 
fortunate to have hired a solid team that approached many of the projects we 
worked on in a team manner.  I think that approach has been successful and I 
am hopeful that major contributors on the team will be compensated 
appropriately.

I appreciate your consideration Dave!  Please let me know if you have any 
questions or thoughts regarding this e-mail.

Brian

Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame 
or "cover our backsides";  however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine 
breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the 
desk.  As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white 
issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executives 
of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to 
ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.  
Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this 
divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into 
the overall framework of ENA.

I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading 
floor.

I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas 
business.

I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the 
HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated 
to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas 
that would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to set 
the record straight in the spirit of "Facts Are Friendly".  

First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six - 
eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of 
Wes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year 
end to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not a 
problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just 
the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:  
1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.  
2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31, 
2000. 
 1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF 
was made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based on
         the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several 
years proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice, 
the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period the 
Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the 
physical           capabilities of the facility.  
 2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with 
anything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included 
the         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.  
This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.  
In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left 
in the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it 
could be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.
It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up 
irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I was 
dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level 
involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.  

From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if 
I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the 
cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated 
to and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with other 
issues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring 
around to cover their backside. 

    

Brian, please give me your thoughts via e -mail asap. I believe this will be 
the most effective tool.  Please give me your expectations as well.

Regards
Delainey
Hi Dave,
I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you regarding the roles 
that certain individuals played in closing the Project 20/20 transaction and 
provide you with input on how to rationalize bonus amounts relative to 
everyone's performance rankings and contributions to 20/20.  I am open to 
your suggestion as to when and how best to convey my thoughts on this issue.

Hope you had a good holiday and look forward to talking with you soon.

Harold;

We have today closed our first retail transaction that is a five year 
exclusive gas supply arrangement with Boardwalk Equities, the largest 
apartment building owner in Alberta.  We will be serving 20,000 apartment 
suites with an annual consumption of 1.5 bcf.  The 5 year margin will be 
approximately $1.5 million.  As a result of our direct instructions, 
Boardwalk lobbied the government to provide them with $2.8 million dollars in 
rebates over the next 4 months to shield them from the higher gas prices.  
These rebates will be paid through Enron Direct as the retailer for Boardwalk.

The gas begins flow on March 1.  We are working on other large building 
owners and restaurant chains and expect to close 2 or 3 more deals for flow 
of March 1. Cadillac Fairview is committed to working with us on a gas 
contract within the next 2 weeks.   We now have a strong platform to grow 
quickly, from a standing start one month ago.

Although the government effectively delayed the opening of the retail power 
market for one year through a price cap, we have been able to grasp a first 
mover advantage on retailing natural gas in Alberta.  We expect to have a 
strong retail delivery organization built by mid year, with 35 staff managing 
a significant number of commercial customers.

The current pricing environment creates a large opportunity to sell 5 year 
fixed price product with significant margins.  Atco, the gas utility is 
getting bad press for not offering hedging instruments, and are cooperating 
with us to assist us in getting established as a retailer.  

This has been a very large effort in the last month, as we needed to get 
licensed, and get legal agreements in place where there were no precedents to 
look at.  We are excited at the prospects for a substantial business 
developing very quickly here in Alberta.  The Enron Canada analytical, risk 
management, regulatory and legal staff have provided great assistance to 
allow us to execute this transaction in a short period.

Regards.

that outlined how my experience could help the Toronto office expand 
business. As I indicated in my e-mail, my career interest, and my view of the 
needs of the Toronto office, is for a role that would look more like cash 
trading/services transaction management rather than pure coverage.  Paul and 
I agree that there is not enough happening in the cash trading/services area 
right now to warrant my move to Toronto.  We are hopeful that at some point 
within the next year, this will not be the case and Garrett Tripp will find 
himself too busy to effectively manage what needs to be done.  This probably 
will occur soon after market opening, rather than before.  At that time, I 
could be ready to go quickly.  If market conditions change so that my skills 
are not a real good fit, than we would not make the move.  I am confident I 
can stay abreast of Ontario market issues from Portland to limit any learning 
curve once a move happens.

I think Paul is comfortable with this plan.  He was going to run it by Rob.   
Please let me know if you are OK with this plan as well.

Thanks again for the consideration.

Chris

Randy, give them what they want and lets move on - don't give another 
guarantee provide the indemnity for the IRS and environmental claims.  Mark 
if there is a flaw in my thinking let me know.

Joe, these guys have been exceedingly difficult to deal with - I would think 
twice before we bring these guys into any Enron deal in the future.

Last week during the holidays, we made a lot of progress w/ Fidelity 
regarding their "take-out" from the Partnership at Dallas.  We exchanged 2 
drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 
99% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 
2001.  Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would 
be extinguished.  However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're 
not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.  The way the deal w/ 
Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM 
initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close 
(est to be $300K+/-).  Fidelity wants 2 things:

protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits 
accrued (i.e., the $300K), and
protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they 
were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001).

There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:

replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a 
specific cap on the tax credit amount ($300K+/-) and with the same 
environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to 
issues which occurred while they were a partner.  The probability of either 
ever being triggered is extremely remote.  Replacing the benefactor from LGI 
to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental 
exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP 
interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.
replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides 
Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.  Per ENA accounting 
since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would 
not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance 
sheet item.

The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty "in hand" and unless you give 
me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any 
leverage to get them to release it.  They are willing to work with us on 
either of the 2 alternatives listed above.  This is the only remaining 
commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.

Please advise or call to discuss further.  Ext. 33212.  Thanks!

Hey Dave. We are focused on selling our interests in the Calvert City, Ky. 
site now that we've successfully transferred the AES sale from Calvert City 
to Haywood. We have two counterparties that have shown a high degree of 
interest in Calvert City: Duke and Cleco. There are no issues surrounding 
Cleco but there may be with Duke from the following standpoint: our Calvert 
City site is ahead of Duke's Calvert City site in the interconnect que. 
Apparently, TVA erroneously did not factor in our interconnect application 
into their facilities study for Duke, and gave Duke an indication that there 
should not be material transmission upgrade costs for their plant 
interconnect. As both TVA and Duke now realize, our interconnect status does 
present a problem for Duke (and therefore TVA). We plan to talk with Duke in 
parallel with Cleco and I anticipate Duke then confronting TVA with the 
situation. 

I want to ensure our discussions with TVA and Duke over the next few weeks 
don't jeopardize our settlement with TVA. Will this settlement be closed by 
mid-January (thought that's what I heard)? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

  

Mark, do we really want a story on SA at this point? Seems we have better 
things to talk about at this point in time.

Dave,

FYI on the content of this proposed interview.

My suggestion to PR was to have you and/or John L. be the primary 
interviewees, with me sitting by your side to add local commentary (if 
needed).  I was trying to take the story in the following direction:  Enron 
is now applying its successful NA business model to South America...these are 
the things we will be doing now...these are the things we will be doing in 
the future...discuss logic of the split of assets versus commercial business 
units...this is a natural step in the evolution of the South AMerican market 
and in the evolution of Enron...etc.

I have not called you since I figure you are crushed under the post holiday 
"pile".  I will be in Houston Thursday (one day ahead of PRC) in the EB on 
floor 49.

We are surviving down here and moving forward.  I need to pick your brain 
about an agenda for your visit next week when convenient for you (earlier is 
obviously better for us)

Thanks,

Kish 
Kish:  I relayed your "protocol" question to John Ambler, VP for Intl PR, as 
he set up the interview with Rebecca.  I'm waiting to hear from him on your 
suggestion.  Meanwhile, attached is a description of the scope of the 
article--which the reporter just told me might be changing somewhat.  I'll 
keep you posted.  Regards, Keith
Jena:  I look forward to receiving more details on the storyline that you
will be developing.  Meanwhile, I work on identifying who you should
interview in Enron to provide you with the information you are seeking.
Regards, Keith

Hi Keith,
Here's some thoughts we have on the story. Of course, like Enron, we're
willing to be flexible, depending on what we find out.

 Since it began in 1985, Enron has always been in the vanguard of U.S.
companies getting into new markets overseas, from India, where the company
made the largest single private investment in the country's history, to
Japan where the company recently announced it will build its first power
plant. How has the company overcome political obstacles and cultural
differences to establish itself internationally?
 This will focus more on South America than the rest of the world. I'll
look
at the transition from working on pipeline projects in South America to the
more service-oriented business in Argentina. Also, what about workers - do
you hire local management and oversee the operations from Houston? IF so,
why? I'll also look at the pipeline and the creation of this natural gas
market in South America. How did the project ultimately turn out for
residents & customers there? What does Enron see in its future in South
America.

I know this is pretty vague, but I expect to do more research in the coming
weeks and have it more ironed out.

Dave,

I know I should be generating money instead of spending it, but I would like 
your approval to spend $20K on four packages for this year's SuperBowl.  In 
lieu of a mass-market customer event, I would like to target certain decision 
makers that are involved in large transactions.  With that in mind, we would 
like to invite individuals from Black Hills (buyer of PSCo project), and 
either Avista or McCook Metals (buyer of Longview project).   Two Enron 
people (Parquet, Jake or I) would go with two executives.  In the past, West 
Power has signed up for 8+ packages - I have appropriately scaled it back, 
but I do think this type of selective client entertainment has value.

Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's 
review and then detailed review with each team.

This workbook has a number of worksheets including:
 a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we 
own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC;
 b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay 
expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be 
offset by larger monetizations;
 c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external 
capital charges are added back to reach EBIT;
 d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget;
 e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT 
non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups 
and bonus/other comp;
 f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 
assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond;
 g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, 
assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then 
calculates a net capital and depreciation charge;
 h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no 
anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant 
investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are 
charged @ a blended rate of 9%.

Two action items:
 a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his 
comment and review &
 b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for 
distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of 
weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet 
(including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), 
leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would 
like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.

Quick update on Keyspan:  Gil Muhl flew to New York yesterday to spend the 
afternoon with Chuck Devario. It sounds like their meeting went very well as 
they spent a few hours discussing Keyspan's situation in the Northeast market 
and how an Enron/Keyspan "JV" would work. They actually outlined a lot of 
ideas on the white board and it basically sounds like Chuck is very 
interested in pursuing this JV that would focus on optimizing Keyspan's gas, 
power, and fuel oil portfolios. Chuck is now planning to come to Houston in 
mid-January to sit down with us and further these discussions. If the Houston 
visit goes well we will then plan to take him to Chicago to show him 
first-hand the Enron/People's JV (trading floor, office set-up, discussion of 
general contractual arrangements between the reg. utility and unreg. 
affiliate, etc.). Chuck knows Tom Patrick and it would be a great way to show 
him how well our Chicago JV has worked for both People's and Enron. Obviously 
this visit and meeting will need to be tightly finessed but I'm confident 
that with Laura Luce/Bill Morrow and Gil, Chuck, and myself, it will work.

We may want to consider getting out with Keyspan and People's together in a 
more social setting sometime in March (maybe the Master's would work). I 
think Keyspan has the ability to get out of the Coral relationship early if 
they really wanted to (it currently goes through April, 2002) although I 
think it will probably take the better part of next year to formulate the 
entire structure around this JV. I think the potential is to have a 
commercial structure in place and effective going into next winter or 
coinciding with the termination of the Keyspan/Coral relationship in April 
2002.

Okay, now the players needed to make this happen....Gil needs to be 
intimately involved. His knowledge of that market and company and his 
relationship with Devario, Anderson, Fazio, the operational folks, etc. is 
extremely good. If you decide that you do not want to have Gil involved in 
this (not a good decision) you need to move him out of his current role. 
Given the fact that we are using the People's JV as a showcase, Laura Luce 
can be very closely connected to Gil and Keyspan in a very natural and 
genuine way. Gil will need to lean on Laura's expertise in how she set up the 
Chicago JV throughout the process. I plan to insert Michael Brown into the 
deal team to focus on the power and fuel oil components. Michael has 
excellent relationships with all the folks at Keyspan and his knowledge of 
Keyspan's power portfolio and that power market will be critical. Ed 
McMichael will lead all the structuring effort (gas and maybe power too), and 
we'll need Bob Superty from the  operational side. 

Although it is still unclear as to whether Keyspan will decide to request 
proposals from several players, it is clear that with our overall 
capabilities and genuine desire to be flexible on the commercial structure in 
what we put together with them, Chuck Devario is very interested in pursuing 
more detailed discussions in the very near future.
 
I'd like you to be available to spend some time with Chuck and I when he 
comes to Houston in January ( maybe  a late morning meeting and lunch) and 
I'll coordinate with Kay on that.

Let me know if you want to talk about this ahead of time. I'll be here all 
next week. 

Guys, great job on this one.....

 2001 - should be a big year for Mexico:
   a) equity sell down of the Monterrey project;

Eric, as per our discussion, I would suggest that we have no quotes or 
comments in the press release.  As a sale of assets, which we do actively, in 
a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said 
without reflecting poorly on the buyer.  I would suggest that we approve an 
AEP press release as we did with Allegheny.  If we have not already, I would 
not send the attached press release to AEP without cutting out the quote.

Dave,

I understand that you are also a former UWO grad (please correct me if this 
is incorrect).

Are you involved in the decisions to recruit or provide sponsorship at Ivey?

The reason I ask is that the LEADER Project at Ivey is in need of a new lead 
sponsor and given the new developments in Ontario and Alberta with dereg, 
this may be a great opportunity to get Enron's name out in the business 
community.

I was very involved with the LEADER Project when I was at Ivey as one of the 
Executive Directors and oversaw general operations as well as the Western 
Region (i.e. Ukraine and Belarus).  While Enron may not have specific 
interests to promote in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, or Kazakstan, LEADER is a 
very large and well respected project within the school and amongst the 
alumni.   I have already made a $250 personal donation to the project and 
would love to see a greater presence of Enron (Houston) on campus.

I know that this is a busy time of year but perhaps you can consider the idea 
and we can discuss its potential in the new year.

Thanks in advance,

To Everyone in the Calgary and Toronto offices (from Peter Keohane):

As you know from the numerous press stories and my earlier e-mail messages, 
the Competition Bureau conducted an investigation into the activities of 
Enron Canada Corp. and British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation regarding 
transactions in the Alberta Power Pool.  As you know, we were co-operating to 
the fullest extent possible with the investigating authorities, and we were 
confident that there was no substance to the allegations.  Accordingly, it is 
with great pleasure that I inform all of you that the Competition Bureau has 
announced in a press release, that the alleged offences under the Competition 
Act were unsubstantiated and that the Competition Bureau has closed the 
inquiry.  To quote the Competition Bureau, "The evidence suggests that the 
companies were employing independent business strategies and were not 
colluding on bids."  I want to thank everyone for their co-operation in 
dealing with this disruptive matter.

Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price 
contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from 
such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.  
My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like 
#1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests 
appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already 
given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end 
of the scale and early.

Drop me a note on where you end up.

Dave:

Do you have any general guidance on how you would like for me to approach the 
EPC contract with NEPCO Houston?  The three options that we currently have on 
the table are:

Fixed engineering/internal costs with pass-through on external costs with fee.
Same structure with cap.
Fixed price contract.

Our last conversation was very focused on a fixed price contract.  My 
conversations with Dan Leff were moving in the direction of one or two.  My 
concern on a fixed price number is the timing and my negotiating position, 
but I understand your issues.  Any general thoughts would be helpful.

Thanks,
Brett

Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues 
for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call 
regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be 
worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you 
are doing the right thing.

Regards
Delainey
Christopher F Calger
11/19/2000 01:35 PM
Dave,

We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.    
Kelemen is doing a great job.

In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has 
one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.  Without giving 
up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to 
position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their 
original bid.

Calpine - Pastoria
Early in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid 
primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, 
and their bid assumed  "market" for the turbines.   While they are correct 
(the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.  
There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not 
used between signing and closing.  Calpine also wanted to include other 
permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep 
that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and 
operate.  This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.  Our plan 
is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.  
The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the 
development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at 
risk.  This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs 
are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.  

AES - Pastoria
Same PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development 
risks (other than CEC).  They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, 
they want a more-involved transition team and  they want us to take more risk 
on post-signing/pre-closing development.  Their bid was $27million plus 
upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and 
schedule coordination services.  We have given them term sheets that provide 
for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 
per year of risk-free service revenues.  They have not yet responded.  By 
contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services 
or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).  

CEC Process:
On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), 
recommending approval of the Project.  By statute, this is one month early 
and the quickest in California to date.  This is a 400 page document and we 
are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original 
filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.  The stated 
process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which 
their is a 30 day appeal period.  If there is no appeal, the process is done 
Jan 19.  For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through 
the public hearing process.  While there was some intervention, our remote 
site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.  In 
order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that 
(i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.  In the 
past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was 
due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the 
law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk 
on the CEC permit getting appealed.  In Calpine's words, it would look pretty 
bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to 
Enron for nothing! 

AES-Las Vegas
They seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the 
QF.  They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.  
We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.  They 
have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, 
liability limits and the consortium EPC group.  They indicated that they have 
no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value 
of hitting June, 2002.  They want to meet with the EPC group and provide 
input to the notice to proceed.  Closing for them on this deal is a little 
cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as 
big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   
Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if 
they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on 
them for a week or so to try to get it closed.  

Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during 
the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.  Sometime 
before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings 
recognition.  We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about 
different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (iii) selling to 
Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.  As you can imagine, 
there are pros and cons to each approach.  We expect to know more on this by 
Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.

Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.  If 
they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to 
close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater 
the risk of missing June 2002 COD.  With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid 
results in a $6MM hit.  Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market 
valuation.  Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the 
hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's 
being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is 
accrual and being sold into Turbopark.  Like the Pastoria analysis, we will 
know more this week and will update you when we know.

Chris

Randal Maffett
12/19/2000 10:32 AM
Dave - I think I've worked out a solution to the Fidelity problem.  Enron 
North America and Fidelity will agree to a back to back Put/Call option 
whereby after closing the sale to PNE Enron has a 6 month Call option (thru 
6/30/01) to cash them out at the contract price (=$5.2MM less PV10 of accrued 
tax credits to date).  For the period of July 1-31, 2001 Fidelity would have 
a Put option at the same price.

This accomplishes the following:

Preserves $5MM cash for Enron by allowing us 6 months to find a new buyer for 
the tax credits and doing a back to back flip.
Preserves the integrity of the tax credits for cal 2001 (Gasco and Genco have 
to be unaffiliated) which will maximize our ability to recover our 
costs/minimize losses.
Gives Fidelity a date certain when they're out of the deal AND gives them 
optionality to stay in if they choose.
Gets the deal between Ecogas and PNE done structurally to PNE's satisfaction.

I spoke w/ Donahue about internal approvals and since Enron is already 
exposed for the $5.2MM, and the balance can only go down (not up), we didn't 
feel this would need anything other than ENA Legal and Office of the 
Chairman.  I'll assume this is correct unless I'm told otherwise.

Guys, the outside date on termination due to force majeure was moved to 
October 31,2002.  It is our risk to construct the pipeline;however, it is a 
breach of contract if Petrobras does not have gas at the site by April 30, 
2002.

Regards
Delainey

Larry:

Rick Buy has asked that I respond to you directly on your concerns outlined 
in your memo this morning:

1.  With respect to EPC price, the range in the DASH text indicates EPC Price 
range reported to us by the deal team without the contingency.   Dan Leff has 
changed the DASH to reflect a range with the $10 million contingency.  For 
modelling purposes, we have used the following aggregated values in our 
probabilistic evaluation to account for the EPC Contract Price and a $10 
million hard cost contingency:

   ($000s)
P5   $194.25
P50 (expected)  $210.00    
P95   $225.75

2.  With regard to schedule, I am told that EE&CC has a copy of the 
Consortium Agreement where this information is contained.  I retrieved this 
information from that document.  I have attached a copy of the Consortium 
Agreement.  I hear your points and understand the risk.  The schedule will be 
driven by receipt of the necessary permits.  If the permitting process does 
not proceed as expected, I recommend that EWS/Americas Management reconsider 
the incremental investment in the project.  On-going dialogue between 
EWS/Americas and EE&CC will be essential in determining the continued 
viability of the schedule.  Enron owns 25% of CEG and does not have 
control--I would recommend that we consult with Enron legal on this question.

3.  It is prudent to restrict expenditures to $15 million until we receive 
our permits given this is the maximum recoverable amount from Petrobras.  
From a permitting perspective, we are unable to commence construction of the 
plant beyond site clearance without the actual environmental and installation 
permits anyway, so whether or not we place a $15 million constraint on 
expenditure, the absence of permits will not allow for further construction.  
An issue comes along with respect to long-lead items and whether these should 
be ordered in advance of permit issuance.  Our understanding is that the $15 
million figure was derived with the assistance of EE&CC and takes into 
consideration funding required for long-lead items.

4.  The 9169 btu/kwh is assumed to be LHV in the model.

5.  The Consortium Agreement anticipates a 92% availability for maximum 
payout of the capacity payment.  The capacity payment is discounted ratably 
to the extent the Equivalent Availability Factor is less than 92% as per 
Schedule 8.06 in the Consortium Agreement.

With regard to future co-ordination, please designate an individual to be 
placed on the circulation for all DASHs in the future.  I will ensure that a 
DASH is provided within a time frame appropriate for response and discussion.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,

Chip

Larry L Izzo@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
12/19/2000 10:04 AM
Rick, I was provided a copy of the DASH at 6:30 PM last evening and asked to 
sign off soonest.  My comments follow:

Cost:  the DASH is incorrect.  EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and 
a guaranteed price.
EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM.
EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.  
We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.  Since last week, 
the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.  It is unlikely that 
the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.  
$202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of 
overruns and schedule.  This would require the Owner to maintain a 
contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM.
After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was 
going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this 
estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the 
numbers I saw last week.
Schedule:  Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by 
Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.  The ability of 
Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 2002 if the project is not completed due 
to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not 
totally impossible.  Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 2002, 
termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force 
majeure.  This is considered more of an onerous risk.  It's not clear to me 
whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project 
would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a 
partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company.
On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 2001 start-up, is 
reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.  
If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to 
$15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk.
Performance:  The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site 
condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears 
correct, if it is LHV.
O&M Guarantee:  The DASH is not clear on what O&M availability guarantee 
Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.  I would suggest that OEC insure it 
agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras 
agreement.

Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the 
RAC needs improvement.  In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide 
to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma 
against the PPA.  This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of 
experience.  The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.  I 
suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.

Regards,

Larry

Some time ago, I had received approval to purchase the primary block of land 
for the Rio project site from Jim.  One year ago, we had acquired the rights 
to purchase the land under an option agreement.  This agreement is about to 
expire and we are currently closing the transaction to purchase the land.  
The total purchase price of the block is $1.7 million.  This closing is to 
take place tomorrow.  Given the changes, I thought I should run this by you 
to make sure you would be in agreement.  I had hoped that this would be a 
moot point with the Petrobras agreement closed.  However, I think we may be a 
couple more days on that.  I am very concerned with waiting on the landowner 
given that our option agreement will be expiring.  Please let me know if it 
is ok to move forward with the land purchase.

Thanks,

Guys, I assume you are keeping an eye on "California East".  Any help you can 
give Kevin would be much appreciated.

This NY cap proposal must be prevented.   The proposal is essentially 
cost-based regulation.   Obviously, if the proposal below was adopted by NY, 
Enron's ability to make money is greatly diminished.   In addition, it has 
significant effects on the rest of the market in terms of regulatory 
uncertainty in the forward markets.

In the past, FERC has ruled to make caps consistent in all 3 NE regions (NY, 
NE, and PJM), which leads to quasi caps in the rest of the Eastern 
Interconnect.

Jim,
We need an action plan ASAP.   Please coordinate with Dana, Tom May, and 
myself.

FYI.  In the interest of all the developing markets, I think that we need to 
make a full court press to ensure that this does not get enough support to 
pass at the committee level in New York.  I will arrange a meeting with 
regulatory to plan our response.

Tom.
Earlier today, the New York Public Service Commission released a 122 page 
draft report prepared by its staff evaluating the NYISO. The report concludes 
that the ISO must pursue a wide range of operational reforms and other 
consumer safeguards to "ensure a more efficient and stable electric market 
that will better protect consumers from dramatic price increases." The report 
culminates a months-long investigation begun by the PSC last summer in 
response to problems and price run-ups in the wholesale market.

The major recommendations in the Report, some of which have already surfaced 
in recent ISO Committee meetings, would be devastating to a competitive 
wholesale market and would largely reregulate prices in New York. They 
include the following (taken directly from the PSC's Press Release):

Reforming rules and procedures to improve the efficiency of the market and 
minimize opportunities for market manipulation, or "gaming," by owners of 
electricity generating facilities;
Initiating a $150 per megawatt hour price cap on generators to maintain 
reasonable market clearing prices;
Creating a "circuit-breaker" mechanism that will prevent market power abuses 
at levels below $150/MWH;
Lowering price thresholds significantly to allow the NYISO to step in more 
quickly to investigate and mitigate price spikes;
Granting the NYISO retroactive refund authority to return to consumers gains 
that generators improperly derive from market power abuse; and,
Creating a strong deterrent against price abuses by penalizing generators who 
repeatedly use improper tactics to raise prices above competitive levels.

The NYPSC, of course, has no legal authority to impose any of these 
recommendations. However, they are likely to muster support from the 
Transmission Owners, governmental entities and loads, that usually control 
enough votes to just  pass a motion at an ISO Committee. This will set up a 
confrontation with the ISO Board, which is walking a delicate tightrope 
between maintaining its independence and supporting a competitive wholesale 
market on the one hand, and dealing with the politics of a hostile 
Administration in New York. Last summer, as you may recall, the Board 
rejected the $1000 bid cap pushed through by the PSC, voting instead for a 
$1300 cap. That action was set aside by FERC, which reimposed the $1,000 
level and then made it applicable in New England as well so that there would 
be consistency among the three Northeast ISOs (PJM already had the $1,000 
cap.) 

Thus, whether NY follows the lead of California is likely to be determined by 
FERC, and it will have to carefully consider the consistency concerns it 
raised last summer in ultimately deciding whether it's OK for New York to set 
price caps below its neighboring ISOs.

Attached is a copy of the PSC's Press Release and Report.

Dear Dave,

Very nice meeting and talking to you last Saturday at the party!  This is Li 
Sun, hopefully you still remember me as I said:" I know you and you don't 
know me, that is always the case."  Actually I talked to you at the other 
party in Kevin Hannon's house for summer associates last year, the 
conversation was quite enjoyable and I was greatly impressed by your 
experience with Enron.  

Just want to say hello and please accept my best wishes in this holiday 
season! And I wonder whether you would be kind enough to have time for lunch 
or coffee sometime.

All the best!

We have now refined our initial estimates for potential 4Q fair value 
earnings on each of our portfolio investments:

Dais-Analytic ($8.27 MM) - DAC has signed an agreement with Lucky Goldstar of 
Korea which includes a $5 MM minority equity investment at a pre-money 
valuation equal to $147.9 MM.  The agreement has been signed, is legally 
binding, can not be unilaterally terminated by LG and transfer of money will 
happen as soon as LG receives Korean central bank approval.  (Note:  We could 
take an additional $3.55 MM gain, or $11.8 MM aggregate, if we chose to 
exercise our option to invest $4.5 MM in DAC prior to year end)

Encorp ($14.1 MM) - Encorp has received a term sheet from Ballentine Capital 
which values the company at $100 MM pre-money.  Beacon Capital and Goldman 
Sachs have both passed on making an investment at $100 MM.  Given current 
market conditions, we believe a pre-money valuation of $90 MM is more 
realistic and closer to what Ballentine will ultimately do the deal at.  The 
$14.1 MM figure corresponds to a valuation of $90 MM.   

Solo Energy ($1.5 MM) - the downturn in the equity markets has had its effect 
on Solo's fund raising.  Chase H&Q has solicited a number of investors in the 
market, including Beacon, Perseus, Stephens (Little Rock) and Ballentine and 
all are interested and reviewing.  Charlie's sense is that the term sheets 
that we should receive by year end will be at a valuation lower than the $80 
MM that H&Q has been advertising to the company (and us).  The $1.5 MM figure 
corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $60 MM, which we view as more 
realistic.

Metering Technology Corp. ($1.0 MM) - Aqua International Partners has agreed 
to invest $15 MM at a pre-money valuation of $45 MM.  

Power Systems Mfg LLC ($0.72 MM) - the principals of PSM have agreed to sell 
the company to Calpine for $43 MM, making our warrant worth $1.72 MM.  Enron 
will receive cash for the warrant upon closing of the deal.  PSM's proceeds 
will be paid out over a 2-3 year period.

Utiliquest - we learned in November that Utiliquest had lost its bid to 
retain the Atlanta area locating business of BellSouth, Atlanta Gas & Light, 
Metromedia (Cable TV) and Georgia Power.  This was obviously disappointing to 
us - and symptomatic of the performance which led me to replace Utiliquest's 
CEO just prior to the award of Atlanta bid (which went to STS, a subsidiary 
of Dycom).  The initial indication from the company was that - while Atlanta 
represented $20 MM in revenues (roughly 20% of total revenues) - there would 
be a proportionately smaller change in EBITDA and the bottom line.  After 
further analysis - conducted in connection with our planned divestiture - we 
have determined that there will likely be a $2-3 MM reduction in EBITDA for 
2000.  Our anticipated EBITDA exit multiple is 6-7x 2000 figures.  I need to 
discuss a revaluation of Utiliquest in more detail with Kevin, Wes Colwell 
and Andrea Reed.

Total comes to $25.6 MM plus whatever we determine is achievable on 
Utiliquest. 

Please call if you have any questions.

I just happened to be in Dave's email looking for something for him........I 
saw your name and thought maybe I'd better see if this was something I needed 
to put on his calendar.....As a rule, I do not go into Dave's  email unless I 
am told or looking for something that someone has requested me to print and

Dave,

I am sorry to bother you with this, but I need the benefit of your global 
information base.  Please take a look at the attached email that I sent 
yesterday (the critical issue is in bold faced type).  It is really important 
that we provide a prompt response so that Cinergy can complete their FERC 
filings in a timely manner.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

I believe the correct answer is only New Albany since we do not control the 
MW's for Doyle.  New Albany is a nominal 380MW facility.

Mitch

Sam Behrends of LLGM needs to have an answer to the following question no 
later than the end of business today.  Please provide any information that 
you might have.

"Following the sale of the 2000 peakers to Allegheny and the two 99 peakers 
to Cinergy, how much generation will Enron still own within two wheels of 
TVA?"

I think that the answer is New Albany and Doyle (except that we only own 50% 
of Doyle and Doyle does not have any merchant capacity to sell (i.e. the 
facility is fully dedicated to Oglethorpe)).  I am not certain, however, that 
I have thought of everything and don't know the capacities for these two 
facilities.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Dave:
I know we just completed a deal with Cinergy, but I have another idea for us 
to kick around with these guys.  They are building 1,000 MWs, very efficient, 
coal facility along the Ohio river.  Talking with Ben Jacoby and Fred Mitro I 
found out that we are looking at either building a coal facility or investing 
in one, which would create a great hedge against gas.  I am beginning to go 
through the information that Ben and Fred have put together and I wanted to 
sign up a CA with Cinergy regarding this issue.  I was planning on running 
with this, but wanted to make sure this was the type of investment that we 
might be interested in.  I think a partnership in coal with Cinergy could be 
a great partnership for us.  I hope this idea is what you had in mind.  
Thanks in advance for your time.

Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss 
to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing 
this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems 
to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are 
meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should 
keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on 
your radar screen for your discussions with Wes.

My idea would be to confirm that appropriate due diligence has been done. Has 
the mid-year performance evaluation been reviewed? Has his two direct 
supervisors been contacted (Ozzie Pagan and Gil Muhl) for specific input into 
this? Once all this has been confirmed and everyone has agreed, you should 
make a decision to either re-deploy him to another area or offer him a 
severence package. 

My recommendation would be to have him in a coverage role in Southeast gas.

You guys need to manage this.......

Hey guys. I'm hearing through the grapevine that we now have a new ENA 
Analyst trading program. Allegedly, phone calls are getting ready to go out 
from HR to offer these individuals a spot in the program and possibly a 
different compensation program along with it. Allegedly there are a couple 
"targeted" Analysts within Origination. 

What's up with this? If there is any truth to this we need to discuss. If 
not, please confirm so I can appropriately manage. 

Thanks much guys - much appreciate it.  Have a good new year.

This is the best I can get today - it includes all that are not EES - but I'm guessing that you have a fairly good feel for them.

Another health warning - this shows individuals who are still on the payroll - some of who I know have left the company ( eg. Jeff Shankman and Mike McConnell) 

I should be able to get you the EES information on Monday

Let me know if you need anything else.

Neil
Neil, per your request below, please see attached file.  As I mentioned, in our phone conversation, EES employees are not included in the report because I do not have access to them via Business Objects.  Please validate the report for accuracy.  Thanks.

This will be a central coordination point and all materials will be distributed to appropriate individuals for handling.

Dick, thanks for the e-mail.  I don't think I disagree with any of the points you made and I do think we have come a long way over the last year in the DSM "technology" we employ.  Unfortunately, a lot of these changes in thinking, sales and cost structure are too little too late.  It is highly unlikely at this point that EES will exist beyond next week.  All the best in the future and I would like to personally thank you for your contribution, thought process and caring to the end to make your point.

Regards
Delainey
Dave, Janet, and Dan,

Before I think about where I could best apply my talents somewhere else I want to make sure you know why I (and all the other DSM developers) can bring value to you at EES.

If DSM is part of the future offering of EES I think it is absolutely essential that you have your own developers in house, both in the home office and the field offices.  They are the originators of DSM value.  There are no projects for the rest of the DSM team to evaluate and plan for until a developer puts it on the list in the first place.  I routinely make the decision on my own whether to include or discard projects that have NPVs over $1million each.  I think this should be seen as a key decision in our business process!

I think there has not been enough recognition at EES that DSM development is a creative activity.  Those lists of projects we price and implement can't be created by having a rookie go down a checklist.  The DSM engineers ask a lot of probing questions to find projects that will both save energy and be acceptable to the customer.  And the largest, most valuable projects take the most experience and creativity to discover.

There has been talk about outsourcing the development services in the past.  That can be done to a point but you need to have your own developers to teach the outsiders and evaluate their work.  I have worked on EES development efforts with outside consultants and they always need some time to catch on to our value proposition and our ways of processing information.

As you are thinking about the future of EES I want to make a sales pitch for keeping the team of DSM developers you have.  This has been my niche in life here at EES the past 3 years, and was the entire focus of my professional life for the 8 years before that.  I am a licensed Professional Engineer and a Certified Energy Manager.  I know what I am talking about--you have a very talented, experienced team that should be seen as a source of value and not just necessary overhead.

Most of your developers came from smaller organizations where we performed more functions--everything from cold sales calls, to report writing, to bookkeeping, to ordering office supplies and shoveling snow.  We can do it again!

Ray, as per your request see attached::

The bottom line we will need approximately $82M for the month of December in order to maintain an asset worth approximately $375M.  The vast majority 80%+ is prepaid energy which will be recovered from the customer.  It is highly likely that we will be able to sell this book.

Based on confirmation by Tony Valenzuela that the Enron - Dynergy merger will
not occur as suggested in your memo of November 20, 2001, I am concerned about
your company's ability to perform under our Commodity Management Agreement
(CMA) dated January 6, 2001.

Accordingly, please:

1. prove to me that the utility accounts for which your company provides bill
payment services are current and utility invoices for the October month
business have been paid and there are no amounts in arrears,

2. prove to me that natural gas deliveries were properly made for November,
2001  into the citygates of the local distribution companies which service the
natural gas accounts listed in the CMA,

3. Prove to me that natural gas deliveries will be properly made for December,
2001  into the citygates of the local distribution companies which service the
natural gas accounts listed in the CMA.

Please provide this information by the end of this week so that we are
comfortable that our agreement is in proper working order for the month of
December, 2001.

Thank you.

Guys, it would be great to be able to go off-site in two different locations for these guys but given the fact I had to personally buy the paper for copying the termination packages, I don't think there any funds to spend.  Perhaps there are empty offices in 3 Allen.  Please look into.  Either way we need to ensure that these guys are fairly well seperated.  I am waiting for a confidentiality from Calpine and AEP this AM.

Court would have to approve any reduction or significant change that we would do outside the normal course of business - short answer probably no on the non-compete otherwise we are down to 100 people have at it.

Took a call from Bill Cronin at New Power  today. He requested that they be able to deal with commercial customers that were off limits before, ie medium commercial or large commercial. He also mentioned that they may have an interesty in some of the people. Any thoughts?

Ray, in EES, the Construction Services (also known as EFS) companies operat=
e on a stand alone basis from Enron and have clear liquidation value to the=
 parents - EES and Enron Corp.  It is my opinion that we should be trying t=
o "un-buckle" these companies from Enron over the short term to ensure thei=
r continued viablility as we find a sale.  In my view un-buckling means a) =
stop the factoring of any Construction Services receivables that end up mov=
ing cash out of Construction Services up into the parents; b) utilizing tho=
se receivables plus, if necessary, Enron's interest in Construction Service=
s to obtain sufficient collateral to renew the St. Paul surety bond.  This =
surety bond is necessary to continue contracting; and c) terminate the swee=
ping of cash from Construction Services bank accounts to Corp immediately. =
 There will be a meeting early next week with St Paul to renew the surety b=
ond.  I am hopeful that meeting these conditions will be enough to reinstat=
e the surety bond.  The Construction Services group employs approximately 2=
,600 people and is worth (given current backlog) between $100 and $125 mill=
ion dollars.  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 6=
0 to 90 days and we control 100% of the stock of this company.

The other part half of the former EFS is the Facility Services group (also =
know as ServiceCo). Again, these companies largely operate independently of=
 Enron and have going concern value outside of Enron.  Currently, we have o=

employs approximately 1,400 people and is worth minimum $50 million dollars=
 (cash value).  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell or otherwise =
dispose over the next 60 to 90 days.

EES also manages several joint ventures (DSM and O&M related mostly) with c=

these entities. These include Owens Corning Energy LLC (Owens Corning), LE =
Hesten Energy LLC (Lily), Tenant Services Inc. (Simon Properties), EBC Prop=

What's up

Dave, Scott and I were speaking with Rob this morning on a number of issues and concluded that it might be a good idea to have a video conference late this week (maybe Thursday afternoon) to discuss the future of the Enron Direct businesses in North America.

Could I ask that Kay set this up?

Dave,
Thanks for stopping by today.  I've enjoyed working with you.  You're an outstanding leader, and I don't say that lightly.  It's disappointing that we won't finish what we've started.  However, I'm confident this will work out for the best.
 
Below is my contact information.  If you can provide me with your contact information, I'd like to take you up on your offer to be a reference...I'll use it judiciously.
 
If you need someone down the road that is dedicated, capable and will get the job done, please keep me in mind.

fyi
That sounds reasonable.  We will have to talk to the people.  

Guys, it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel (Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, Edith Cross, etc) into NETCO before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization.  It is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all EES retail risk contracts are valued and discharged (termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate.  After completion of this effort, these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate.  I would expect this to take the next four weeks.

Thanks

Kimberly, I was laid off on Monday and have not had my latest expense report electronically deposited into the credit union.  I was assured by management that I would be paid.  The amount is 642.10.  I would think that this is the least enron could do for me since I have only worked for EES for 2 months.  
 
Please ensure that my funds are deposited as soon as possible due to my current financial crisis.
 
Thank You,

FYI

We have presented the following customer counts to buyers, which are compared below against Beth and Shelly's numbers:

		Count presented		Total Available (from Beth)		Shortfall
Texas			14,696			17,100				14%
New York		7,658			8,500				10%
Massach.		4,944			5,700				13%

The count presented to buyers came by utilizing the data in the sequel server database (maintained by Chris McCaig and Mary John) and the information in the RPS system (the booking batch files).  We are working with deal capture to determine the sources of discrepancies.

After receiving bids today, we will 1. determine to what extent we want to book and process remaininig deals, 2. develop a plan for developing the definitive mass market customer list.

Kevin

Just a quick update from Shelly and I on where we stand with processing all of the Mass Market contracts.  We will need more resources to process the remaining 6,000 contracts.  We estimate that it would take 12 people 1 week.  

  Texas  ---
 
We are aware of  approximately 18,000 contracts signed to date  -- of those approximately 900 were rejected for Credit and Data Issues - net contracts 17,100
               

                          6,000   completely processed and on hold at CSC
                          7,700   processed but not submitted to CSC
                          3,400   NEED TO BE Booked and processed  
                         ---------
                         17,100  Total available TX contracts

In order to process them  -- they need to be booked to the risk books (Deb  -- assume you can have someone work on this)  and then Shelly's team can validate and pull the extra data that is needed  -- ESID's and 4 digit zip code extensions.  They will also validate credit approval etc like usual.  May need additional people to find missing data like Mary John's team used to do.

The goal would be to have all of the data ready to tranfer to a buyer  -- so that they can quickly enroll these customers, and have a very clean list of contracts with corresponding values.

New York

We are aware of 9,200 contracts signed to date  -- of these 700 were rejected for a net remaining contrac number of 8,500.

                        5,600 completely processed and sent to CSC   (  x are already live and  y are on hold for enrollment) -- we are getting this breakdown now
                        1,400  processed but not submitted
                        1,500 NEED TO BE Booked and processed
                        -------
                         8,500   total available NY contracts

Similar processing   -- these deals need to be accounted for  -- by booking them

Mass.

We are aware of 6,500 contracts signed to date  -- of those 800 were rejected leaving 5,700 contracts to be processed

                          4,500 completely processed and sent to CSC (x are already live and y are on hold for enrollment )  (we are getting this breakdown now)
                             200 more processed but not submitted
                          1,000  NEED TO BE Booked and processed
                          ---------
                          5,700   total available Mass.  contracts
Similar processing   -- these deals need to be accounted for  -- by booking them

We will need to either hire contractors or borrow staff from other business units to complete this processing.  We estimate that with 6 extra staff this effort would take 2 weeks.  We could cut that time in half with double the staff.  This does not include an estimate of time to book each transaction into RPS thru the batch process.

OK
Who are the authorized parties we are establishing for the new ServiceCo Holdings bank account.  I propose that the account have duel authorization from two of the following: Jimmie Williams and Dan Leff or Janet Dietrich.  Based on conversations with David Roland, we probably do not want to have the ServiceCo directors from Enron authorizing these items unless the ServiceCo BOD acts as a whole.  We need to make sure we continue to have separate controls for the ServiceCo accounts because of the fiduciary duties to the outside investors in ServiceCo.

Jimmie

Mary,

To be clear on what my understanding is of what Ray approved in his conversation with Dave Delainey:

1. A Frost Bank account will be opened for ServiceCo. Holdings Inc. first thing Thursday morning and all of ServiceCo. funds wherever they may be will be moved into this account.  It's my understanding that there is approximately $70MM in funds in various bank accounts, primarily Citibank;

2.  First thing Thursday morning we will stop sweeping any Enron Facility Services (EFS) bank account;

3.  Given that EFS' existing receipt accounts that you will stop sweeping are with Bank of America, I assume we want to set up a Frost account for EFS that they can redirect thier customers to remit to.

You can reach me in my office at 5-7464 or on my cell phone at 713-419-2498 if you have any questions, need any clarity or if any of the above will not be effective first thing in the morning.

Thanks

Wade

Jimmie, I assume that you and Tracey are formulating the options and populating the detailed financials on those options for the board meeting next week.  It would be great if we could see that a couple days in advance.

David, we should probably call a follow up board meeting for next Wednesday or Thursday.

Vicki, we need to speak about the board participation issues and the cash management issues discussed.

Regards
Delainey

Thanks Judy - you are doing the right things and it is important!

Michael;
 
Listed below are some specific answers to your questions.  In addition, please check the www.enron.com <http://www.enron.com> web site regularly for up-to-date Q & A.  You may also call me if you need further clarification.
 
1.  You will be receiving a termination letter and other information regarding your termination this week.
2.  You will receive pay for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday last week. This amount is included on a check that is being mailed to your home this week.
3.  Your termination letter will be the document that you can provide to your wife's employer to enroll in her benefit plan.  This same letter will facilitate an unemployment claim as well as providing documentation for a judge where you are to serve on jury duty

Dave and Janet - Greetings. 
 
In one of the recent FAQs/responses, I was reminded that the vesting requirement for the Cash Balance Plan is 5 years.  I was hired on 1feb97 and was laid off on 3dec01, just less than 2 months from being fully vested.  I am certain that there are others in the same position.  
 
Further, I understand that the Cash Balance Plan is/was fully funded - i.e., the money was there in the account for all the employees on an on-going basis.  
 
But for recent events, I, and many other Enron employees, would have achieved the full vesting for the cash balance plan.
 
So, we are faced with some options:
a) do nothing and maintain the status quo.  Result - loss of Cash Balance Plan.
b) round up from 4.5 years for any Enron employee.  Result - ability to realize the value of the Cash Balance Plan.
c) For administrative purposes only (i.e., no job, no salary, no other benefits), "re-hire" those laid off employees that have 4.5 years or more employment time until they achieve the 5 years vesting requirement for the Cash Balance Plan.  Comment - this option has the potential to be fairly thorny.
 
At any rate, I respectfully request that this issue be looked into.  I, and many other employees were hard-working and loyal.  I'd like to think that the Cash Balance Plan, something that many of us would have achieved but for recent events, will not be lost to us.  
 
Tiiming is everything.
 
Again, and as I did on the last day, I wish you both well.  Best of luck.  Regards.  Scott.

Yo....plant man I'm stranded in NYC working on LavoCo...I want to go home or denver or vancover...how are things in planetvill.....

Mike, I would agree with your point that we will be attempting to sell the services (DSM/O&M) currently provided by EES to Hensen LLC.  Other than a heads up to Jimmie given the potential effects to EBSI, I am assuming that you and Jeremy et al are managing the sale.  Given the amount of work in front of Jimmie around EFS generally (sale of ConstructionCo and restructuring of ServiceCo, I would hope not to overload Jimmie on another sale process.

Thoughts?

Regards
Delainey
Yesterday, it was decided that we attempt to sell the O&M portion of the EES contract with Eli Lilly.  This would include approx 250 employees that EBSI, through the contract, walked over to its payroll from Lilly.  

This contract is material to EBSI.  Also it is likely that Lilly will oppose a sale of the agreement, accept to a friendly vendor relationship, Kite Development (which has previously expressed interest similar to Honeywell's below).   Please email me with a time we can chat.

Thanks
MM

Mike,

I am handling the sale of the Construction Services Group and we are evaluating ServiceCo alternatives.  From your message it appears they would not be interested in the construction side, but if they are we should speak with them soon.  Otherwise, it would be good to get a contact re: ServiceCo because there may be some things we are interested in selling from within ServiceCo.

Give me a call and we can decide how best to handle them at this time.

Jimmie

Kevin Gilligan, CEO of Honeywell's Home and Building Controls called with an interest in either contracts (parts of old GNO) or other operations, including Service Co.

If we have an interest let me know and I will hook you up and get out of the way or assist with your direction.  Gilligan reports to Honeywell CEO Larry Bossidy.

What are we doing with Rexam?

Regards
Delainey

Section 3.4.2 B allows EES to present a third party offer to REXAM, in lieu of our own supply, in order to preserve our performance under the contract while maintaining the price charged to the Customer (Rexam).  By allowing the Customer to acquire their own gas supply EES may be defaulting on its performance to supply gas.  Please let me know if we need to take any action in this case.

Jess

I received a call today from Jack Bender with Rexam aka American Can(GNO customer) that they are going to secure supply from another supplier for the Peoples and ONG LDC's. We lost all our supply on ONG 12/1 and are now out of storage on Peoples. They were notified by Peoples today that we were not serving them.They indicated they will forward me a copy of their contract with the new supplier as a FYI.

Jeff-Please confirm that our storage is now gone for December for Rexam's pool.

Are each of you available at 1:00 p.m. next Thursday for the next ServiceCo Board meeting?  If not, please let me know your availability for next Wednesday and Thursday.  Once I get a time cleared with you, I'll then check with Tracy, Shael and Brad.

Jimmie, agree; however, EES cannot immediately convey these agreements to EBSI as a sub-contractor permanently post bankruptcy. Under bankruptcy, we need to show an auction process.  In the cases, where EBSI has contracted directly with the client - I think we are ok.

Vicki please add some texture if required.

Regards
Delainey
Mike and I discussed, and I need to be involved only to the extent that there is a current subcontract agreement in place between EES and EBSI for the provision of these O&M services.  Since EBSI is owned by ServiceCo, we need to be careful in the handling of this subcontract as well as the employees.

Dave/Janet

I received a letter from BP (a guy by the name of Bill Burden in Houston).  He expressed an interest in purchasing a wide variety of assets/contracts.  From the EES side, he was interested in the Texas power customers and the California gas and power customers.  According to the letter, BP submitted an indicative bid on the California power customers on 12/2 (it was sent to Angela Schwartz).  In addition, he is/was working with Don Black on the California gas customers.

Bill asked whether Angela is still around as he has not been able to get in touch with her.  If not, could you give me a new name.  What about Don Black?  Also, is there an appropriate point of contact for Texas power.

Please let me know how I should proceed and where we are in the process (I assume that we are considering selling these contracts/customers).

Thanks

Stuart

Guys, the plan,as I am currently aware:

a) Gas - as per our conversation this AM - press on;
b) Power - start with the California customers post June and the Enron Direct books;
c) follow on with the rest of the power book once we are getting traction on (b) above.

Thanks
Dave
Per our meeting this morning, here is a matrix of the action plans on contracts. We will continue to update everyone as we move forward on each item.

Vicki, I would have Janet, Dan, Jeremy, Scott.

Regards
Delainey

I would like to  get with you, Janet, Melanie and whomever else is appropriate to discuss our overall strategy relating to the  rejection or assumption of our contracts.  She has expressed concern that we need to make these decisions quickly, to cut off claims by our customers for post petition nonperformance.  We should go over our overall strategy with her  about our various contract buckets, especially how much longer we can continue serving customers where we are putting them in a penalty situation.  
Melanie will be out of town Monday and Tuesday, so I am going to set this up for tomorrow.  Please let me know who else should attend. Thanks.

I asked Scott to figure out the exposure of EESC to its contracts because I am trying to figure a way to structure the sale of EDCC to maximize the value to Corp.  If these numbers are right ECC is going to take a big bath on its 7.5 M note to EESC.  In addition, we need to put EESC down because its just bleeding cash and is a burden to ECC.  I think we should do it tomorrow and give Owings the heads up.

Gentlemen,
I know this information is very relevant, so want to get it to you even though I am uncomfortable with some of my assumptions.  I have done the best I can to calculate OCC's position in Eastern Canada.  Phone calls to Houston have mostly gone unanswered, and the contract wording is unclear.  Based on my new found knowledge of power utility tariffs, I have some bad news.  A snapshot of my estimated NPV:

($2,000,000)  Owens Corning Gas Position - estimated by Brian Gillis last month (sale at Ontario burner tip at AECO Index + Cdn$1.73/GJ until Sept 30, 2009 while Nova, TCPL and LDC demand, commod & fuel climbs to over $2.40 by 2005.
($4,500,000)  Owens Corning Alberta Position (Sale of approx. 9 MWh until April 2005 at Cdn$28/MWh in a $40 market)
(2,500,000)  Owens Corning Ontario Position (Sale of approx. 18MWh until January 1, 2003 at Cdn$41.33/MWh in a $48 market)
($9,000,000)  Liquidated damages potential

This compares with EES Houston's estimate of a net gain of over US$14 million.  I feel comfortable with the information, but continue to phone Houston to have someone review my assumptions with them.  Also, I was provided a position summary from EES's risk group, and was provided a Quaker Oats power position.  I flipped out when I saw it, and am now chasing it down as well.  Their risk group claim it is in the money by $2.5 million, which probably means under water by a similar amount.

Deborah, I have received your letter dated December 18, 2001 and I will ensure that you get a follow up.

To give you a little texture on the issues, all pre-petition expense statements (Dec 2, 2001) were frozen subject to an overall approval by the bankruptcy court on what could be paid. At this point, we have approval to pay up to $5K immediately and possibly up to $15K per pre-petition expense statement. This part of the bankruptcy process.  It is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition.

Unless I have my facts wrong, you should have been paid already or are in the queue.

Either Kalen or Dan will follow up.  If not please give me a call at 713-853-3829.

I will track down more details this week.  
 
Janet,
 
I read about our west coast C&I/retail power positions today in Chronicle.  Are we keeping these or selling them?  As I mentioned last week, if we keep them, we need to talk about the infrastruture that will be needed to serve these and our other west coast wholesale positions.
 
I will be around all this week   

Was quite familiar with these barges last year. Plan was to sell them and Sean Long was negotiating final doc's. Don't know why we wouldn't want to sell them. Brian Redmond was very involved here, so Don you may want to use him to help here.

I appologize, must have missed the "i" when I typed your name yesterday, as a P.S. to this note, Tony has been cleared by Lord John Brown to have these discussions

David,
Per my phone message, I have been informed through my friend at British Petroleum (Andrew Netemeyer, VP Electric Trading) that there has been an inquiry to Mr Frevert via voice mail by Mr. Tony Fountain (President, BP Energy) about wholesale issues and retail interests of Enron.  They appear to have some issues on the wholesale side to discuss but have significant interest in the retail books of business with EES and wish to discuss these with you asap..Andrew Netemeyer would bring a Mr. Bill Burton in their M&A department into the loop and I beleive they have already had some individuals assigned to due some due diligence if Enron will entertain the interest.  Mr Netemeyer's number is (281) 366-4998, and any assistance I can provide regarding introductions or relationship let me know, they have been considering the expansion of retail gas & power and the timing may be right...

Nancy, I have just returned to Houston from New York.  I have not seen the 
fax you mentioned.  Please call me or e-mail to me the information you need 
me to consider.  Thank you.  Jim

Randy, your proposal is fine by me.  Jim

I did not.  This is the first notice I have had of this matter.  Jim

Did you by any chance sign off on Justin's choice of Indian law firm?

	Wade Cline@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	11/30/2000 09:16 AM
		 
Sandeep, 

Find out which firm Justin is discussing with. Hopefully, it is a "good" 
firm, both in terms of quality and absence of conflicts with what we've done 
in India to date. Let me know.

I hope Justin contacted someone in Enron legal with some experience in India 
before he hired a firm. Hopefully, he talked with you first, as this is 
common courtesy. Maybe he talked with Sarah G, and that would be fine also as 
she is generally aware of the Indian firms we use and don't use.
 

Wade:

Thank you for your quick response!

As I suspected, I was slow on the draw.  Justin Boyd with our London team has 
already directed a firm in India to start looking at these issues.

I'll forward your email to Justin, as he very well may want to coordinate 
some of this through Sandeep, if Sandeep has the capacity to help us out.  

Thanks again for your help.

Sandeep Katwala is our general counsel in India, and he should be able to 
work with you and outside counsel on this. Sandeep -- since this is a bit of 
a rush, I would like for either you or perhaps Lena to work directly with 
Travis and outside counsel and try to get some quick answers. 

Thanks,
Wade

Wade:

I hope things are going well for you.  It was good to see you the other day.  
I'm not even sure where you are right now, but I imagine that you are 
checking your e-mail, wherever you are.  I was hoping you could give us a 
little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a 
reference to someone that could assist us.

Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic  trading marketplace for pulp, paper and 
lumber products (including derivative products).  It is modeled after 
EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities.  The team is in the 
process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the 
Clickpaper website;  in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper 
enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern 
their use of and trading on the site.

Those access and trading agreements are "jurisdiction specific" -- customized 
for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based 
-- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with 
accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory 
issues, etc.   

The team has identified India as having a large number of potential 
customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and 
they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the 
very least arrange to give them access to the site.  We therefore need to 
consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an 
apporpriate access and trading agreement.  EnronOnline has developed a due 
diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our business model 
and raising specific legal issues that we are likely to encounter.

Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could assist 
us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case 
here)?  I would really appreciate any help you could give to us.

To the other  recipients of this message  -- I know that there are several 
people working on this project -- if you already have this project underway, 
please let Wade and I know so we aren't duplicating  your efforts.  Thanks.

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, December 1, 2000
Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of
finalizing
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many
observers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70
countries
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will represent

an arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europe

to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4
billion
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable
decision
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merger

strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategic

contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas trading

and distribution activities in particular-along with its electricity
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion-would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and
commercial
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron
Japan's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, including

Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to
companies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealing

to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closely

may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

John, I think Stan would be fine.  Please call Vince Buckley at Locke Liddell 
with the request to involve Stan.  Jim

Jim,                      Corporate Aviation has been intructed by the Office 
of the Chairman to sell three of its aircraft.  At least one sales will occur 
in the 4th quarter of 2000.  Any sale not completed in the 4th quarter  will 
probably close in the 1st or 2nd quarter of 2001.  The aircraft to be sold  
are currently in structured finance transactions that will need to be 
unwound.  It is my understanding that Stan Pieringer of Locke Liddell & Sapp 
helped put together two of the three transactions that need to be unwound and 
is otherwise familiar with structures of this nature.           In order to 
accomplish the unwinding of the transactions, I believe it is appropriate to 
engage outside counsel.  Given Stan Pieringer's faimiliarty with the type of 
structures to be unwound, I recommend engaging him and his firm for the 
project.   Please advise if engaging Stan Pieringer and Locke Liddell is 
acceptable.

Tom, I'm struggling to keep from becoming a triple digit.  All the best.  Jim

Jim: 

Celina Ozorio is a paralegal in the Rio office who has performed very well 
this past year and who we would like recommend for promotion to a junior 
attorney (Attorney I) position.  I have discussed this with both Randy and 
Rob and they support this move.  

Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLM who was hired a year 
ago as a paralegal rather than as an attorney due to her relative lack of law 
firm experience.  During the past year she has been enthusiastic in pursuing 
her professional development and demonstrating her capabilites as a 
professional.  She has actively sought out opportunities to take on more 
responsibility and to learn more about our business and has worked very hard 
to win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.  We 
believe that she has demonstrated the ability to operate at the junior 
attorney level now and the potential to develop into a solid senior Enron 
attorney in the future.  As a junior attorney, she would continue to work 
under the supervision of more senior attorneys and would have the opportunity 
to continue her professional development.  

I understand that we have done this elsewhere in the Company and believe that 
it sends the right message to others in the department that there are 
opportunities for advancement and that hard work and merit are rewarded.

Please let me know how you feel about this recommendation and whether you 
think it would be appropriate for us to schedule her to visit with you in 
Houston.  Thanks.

Regards,
 John

Tom, the memo is fine, but before sending it we need to get confirmation from 
John Beckworth or Mike Perrin that Senator Bentsen will be able to attend the 
dinner at which the award will be given.  I left messages for John and Mike 
last Friday.  Jim

Tom Henninger <thenninger@mail.law.utexas.edu> on 12/04/2000 10:32:31 AM
Hello, Mr. Derrick--Nancy asked that I send you this draft memo for your
review/approval.  Please let me know if you have difficulty opening it
and/or what changes need to be made to it.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Tom

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to Washington early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his college summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and Kay and
I, as well as the Firm, are significant money contributors to the School.

FYI  
Jim, in connection with your interest in identifying a top notch litigator
in California to look after Enron's interests in California, I would
recommend you consider David Balabian and Chris Hockett of the firm of
McCutchen Doyle Brown and Enerson LLP. McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with
its main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and
Walnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial
litigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP
litigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some
power plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who
I have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that
Chris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David
Balbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the
leading commercial litigators in  Northern California. Establishing a
relationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and access I
assume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any additional
information.  Joe

Dear Rob:

   I am going to be in Houston on business next week from Wednesday on.  I
wondered if there might be a convenient time to stop in to say hello and if
possible take you up on your offer of an introduction to Jim Derrick.  I
have a series of meetings downtown over the three days.  Any one could
easily be moved.  

   Thanks for your help.

We may need to file a suit this week or next to enjoin the signing of a gas 
supply agreement between Petrobras and Compagas.  As you know, Enron 
(Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas.  
Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use 
the gas.  A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant.  
The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow.  The gas supply contract 
would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billion.  The ground for 
the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit 
bids for the gas supply arrangement.   Compagas has sought to justify not 
soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of 
supplying the gas.  This is incorrect:  Enron, among others, is also capable 
of supplying the gas.  We have a legal opinion supporting our position. and 
have called for a special shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue.  We 
anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of 
interest, will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement 
nonetheless. 

Tozzini Freire has been advising us, and is doing an excellent job.  If you 
approve, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necessary.   

Please call me or Randy with any comments or questions.

Thank you.

Marcus, I am ok with your proposed counsel selection.  All the best.  JIm

enforceability of a commercial representative agreement for Enron Metals &

another, unless of course you have a preference for a particular firm in 
Bulgaria.
 
Many thanks.

Linda, I may not be able to participate in the December 14th conference 
call.  I do believe it is important that Robert Eickenroht participate along 
with Jack Urquhart.  Jim 

Al, thanks for the update.  All the best.  Jim

Jim, I need to apologize and confess I skipped the call this morning because
of an uncontrollable addiction to the Presidential election proceedings. 
David Boies and Barry Richards were just too much to pass up.  Sorry.  
Not much here.  We settled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paid
the other lessors and without any of their attorney fees.  Good result.  We
have FERC approval of the Sierra sale.  SEC looks good for Jan or Feb.  
I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibb on defense to the California
class actions.  
We have a new offer from BNFL that will be the subject of a conference call
soon.  Looks like they will pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.  
One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices.  This
will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may
spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.  This could develop
as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. 
More on this as it develops.  The Enron litigation team is here on Monday and
we will cooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.  
Finally, we have received a settlement offer on the Grant County case that
looks good and we are pursuing it.  Al.

regard to my son's (James V. Derrick III) interest in applying to  the SMU 
School of  Law; I am most grateful. SMU is his first choice.   We are 
currently working on his application and hope to get it to the school within 
the next ten days.  He  graduated from the University of Mississippi and is 
currently enrolled in a university in Madrid, Spain studying Spanish. I will 
send you a copy of his application as soon as it is completed.  All the

would recommend that the firm be removed from further engagements. Thanks.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=

the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=

asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=

opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=

Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.

Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=

the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=

at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20

=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=

CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=

EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=

newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=

with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=

Jim,

Carrin asked me to see if you would be available to meet on Tuesday,
December 12 at 2 p.m.   We would meet downtown to begin discussing plans
for the Karen H. Susman Jurisprudence Award Luncheon, now confirmed for
Monday, April 23, 2001.

Vicki:  I am familiar with the firm, but we have never used them to represent 
any of the EFS companies to my knowledge.  I am certain that we do not have 
any current matters with this firm.  You will note that they do not appear on 
our list of approved counsel.  We typically use Reed Smith in Pittsburgh.

 I do know some people at this firm if I can be of any assistance.  I went to 
law school with Artie Rooney at Duquesne University.  You may know that his 
family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Let me know the particular attorney you 
are having difficulty with and I will help in any way can.  By the way, New 
Power's ads have hit the airwaves in Pittsburgh.  I am enrolling as a New 
Power customer!  Thanks, Marty

particularly adverse position.  Thanks.  Marc
Marc:  In connection with a dispute regarding a commercial arrangement 
between NewPower and Campus Dimensions, Inc. (also known as College Credit 
Card Corporation), Campus Dimensions, Inc. ("CDI") has engaged the law firm 
Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to 
represent them against NewPower.  Klett Rooney has conducted themselves in a 
fashion that I would consider to be particularly unreasonable.  I would like 
to know if Enron has a relationship with Klett Rooney or CDI. If they do, I 
would recommend that the firm be removed from further engagements. Thanks.

Nancy, I believe the question was asked by David Beck.  All the best.  Jim

Nancy Brazzil <NBrazzil@mail.law.utexas.edu> on 12/11/2000 10:51:20 AM
did you ask me for information on the school's transnational institute?  it
was either you or david beck.  forgive my forgetfulness.

John, you have my approval.  Jim

Jim,                                In 1998,  ENA removed from its balance 
sheet a loan made to The American Coal Company through a transaction with 
Society Generale.  In 1999 the deal was restructured and Soc Gen was taken 
out by Bank of America.  As part of both transactions, there was an  absolute 
put agreement to Enron in favor of Soc Gen and B of A.  B of A has indicated 
it intends to exercise the put which will have the effect of moving the loan 
back on the books of Enron.  Enron's business people don't want this to 
happen and are going to arrange to have a Whitewing entity buy out the B of A 
position.  In order to timely complete the project, outside counsel needs to 
be engaged.  John Dawson at Vinson & Elkins worked on the original 
transaction and has been contacted about this project.  Please acknowledge 
that it is acceptable to use John Dawson and the firm of Vinson & Elkins on 
this project.  The dollar amount of the transaction is approximately 
$92.0mm.  Thank you for your quick response as the business parties want to 
close the deal asap.  John West

Nancy, I suggest we take the Four Seasons option.  Jim

Nancy Brazzil <NBrazzil@mail.law.utexas.edu> on 12/12/2000 02:30:33 PM
it doesn't look like there is a strong preference of where we hold the
meeting.  i was thinking that if we did have the meeting at the four
seasons, we could go with carrin's idea of having a party that evening --
possibly margaritas on sixth street?  just an idea.

Jim,

We are currently reviewing a new business opportunity with EES to enable 
EECC  to provide technical and commercial due diligence services for global 
infrastructure project financing.  If the new business opportunity receives 
approval from EES management, we see the need to retain outside counsel 
experienced in internet/web based issues.  Presently this need would be with 
the web, structuring, IP, and antitrust areas.

In an effort  to find a firm that Enron has used recently for web related 
matters, I spoke with Mark Taylor and Marianne Castano.  For Enron Online 
development, Mark used Sullivan and Cromwell and Milbank, Tweed for the 
web/trading effort and V & E for IP matters,  For a recent EES internet 
project Marianne used Vivian Polak of LeBeouf Lamb for web/transactional 
issues and V & E for IP matters.  She was very pleased with Vivian's 
support.  After discussing our specific requirements with Mark and Marianne 
and reviewing this matter with Vicki Sharp,  I spoke with Vivian briefly to 
confirm if she had the experience we needed.  I found she had exactly what we 
needed and subsequently discussed this with John Schwartzenburg.  John 
agreed. 

With your approval I would like permission to engage Vivian Polak of LeBeouf, 
Lamb for web, structuring and transactional related issues and Scott Brown of 
V & E for IP matters.  

If you should need any additional information concerning the TECASO Project 
or this request, please let me know.

Thank you,

Randy

Mont, thanks for the status report.  I will stand by.  JIm

Jim,

This is a note to let you know what happened as per your calls on my behalf.

The short answer is not much.

I had lunch with John Keffer and Randy Coles of King & Spalding.  We had a
cordial conversation, but I concluded and stated that the firm was well
covered regarding the skills that I might offer.

John Klauberg and I had a most enjoyable breakfast.  He seemed interested.
However, I haven't heard any thing.

Pat Oxford didn't return my call. I spoke with Lynn Coleman, but didn't hear
any thing back.

Vicky Price and I have exchanged calls, but haven't had a chance to speak.

On another fronts, I was contacted by Strasburger regarding their Mexico and
other Latin work.  They claim to have done a little work for Enron.  Also, I
am still in discussions with Shook, Hardy & Bacon, the Kansas City firm with
about 40 lawyers here in Houston.

Before anything get finalized, I would like to run it by you just to get an
independent reaction.

Thanks for your support and help.

Mont

because you have got married or moved house), or will change in the near 
future, please let me know immediately:

1. personal details (name, address)

2. you are subject to a criminal conviction, regulatory investigation or 
civil litigation (other than as a witness)

We would like to rearrange the next BOD meeting schedule.
As you know, the BOD decided to have the next BOD meeting on Feb. 8th, 2001=

However, we think it is difficult to have the next BOD meeting on that date
because of preparation of financial statement.
Please understand that subsidiaries' financial statement should be=20
consolidated
prior to SK-Enron's financial statement and this process is our main concer=
n.
Considering this situation, we suggest to have the next BOD Meeting at 2pm =
on
Feb. 20th, 2001. in Houston.
And meeting place in Houston will be notified you when it is determined.
If you are uncomfortable with this schedule,
please let us know so that we can arrange it again.

Sincerely yours,

K.R.Choi

 The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in 
his underwear.  Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist 
at me!  The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I 
have not.

 In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), 
I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review 
to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, 
in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.  The Law Review had 
reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.  I arrived late at 
night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key,  
took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the 
room key, and opened the door.  The darkness that shrouded the room was 
suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a 
bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very 
large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had 
violated the sanctity of his room!  

 It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was  
adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough 
for me to offer him one.  Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman 
when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as 
my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale 
of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.  There may well have 
been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the 
end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately. 

 After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent 
reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made 
my way to the meeting room.  During the course of the day, I spotted the 
madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual.  
Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew 
him.  The answer was no, but he did know who he was.  "The name is Susman, my 
man, Steve Susman".  I immediately resolved that my path and that of  
"Susman, my man, Steve Susman" would never again cross.  

 Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  How could I have possibly foreseen 
as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago 
that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as 
his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as 
one of my closest friends!  I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only 
for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on 
me that night.  Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any 
other way.

 I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.  Thanks for your friendship--I 
treasure it. 

 All the best, 

 Jim   

  

Saudi, thanks, but I'll wait until you and I can play it together.  All the 
best.  Jim

I think I will be out of town on the slopes on the 12th but would you be
interested.  This should be great course.  Joe

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)

      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =

The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20

Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =

I agree to the comments included in your fax to me of November 30 being used 
in the way and in the context therein set forth.  Jim Derrick

Bill, I am very grateful for everything you and your firm are doing to assist our cause.  Good luck in the appeal.  All the best.  Jim

FYI

Dear Jim:

Mr. Chike Okpara and Mr. Reginald Sewell have enthusiastically accepted our offer to work at Enron as Summer Associates/Clerks during Summer 2001.

The Term begins on or about May 14, 2001, and ends on or about August 17, 2001.  Both gentlemen indicated that they might need a few days after school ends on May 11, 2001 and begins again on August 20, 2001.  We indicated that we have some flexibility with respect to the start date and we are waiting to receive information from Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell with respect to the dates.

As per our initial discussions, it is my understanding that Enron would like the students to rotate through Enron Broadband Services, Enron Energy Services, and Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want me to include Enron Global Finance, Enron Transportation Services and Enron Corp. in their rotations?

Depending upon the number of Enron entities participating in the rotations, each student will spend approximately 2-3 weeks in each business unit, if there are five business units.  In the event we only have three business units, each student will spend approximately 4 weeks in each area. 

I will make sure that Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell receive a personal introduction to Enron via our orientation process.  Further, I will participate on a weekly basis as a mentor and liaison with each student.  In addition, should we need assignments from Corporate Legal, I will be happy to coordinate the same.

During our program, I envision their duties as follows:

	1.  Provide legal research assistance, including the preparation of legal memorandum and other documents, 
	on various issues;

	2.  Attend meetings and conference calls as required by their respective assignments; and 

	3.  Undertake other legal duties as required by the respective law departments.

I have also spoken to Lisa Falick, Attorney Recruitment Coordinator at Vinson & Elkins.  She will forward to me the Summer Associate/Clerk activities list upon its completion.  

Please advise if you would like for me to take any additional steps.  

Thank you.

Sharon

Hi Jim,

As I mentioned in the elevator last week, we are trying to become more involved with Girls, Inc.  We would love for you and Carrin to sit at the Enron table at their Fifth Annual Luncheon on Tuesday, June 5th.  This event will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center at 12 p.m.  Please let me know if you're in town.  If you unfortunately can't attend, please let Carrin know that we would be honored for her to join us!  

Regarding SPA, I spoke with Toby Maddox a few weeks ago and he is completely on board with Enron's sponsorship of a performance by David Sedaris, a well-known satirist/author.  We supported this past spring's performance of the National Symphony of Spain at the $10,000 level, so we plan to maintain that level of support for the 2002 David Sedaris performance.  Toby and I discussed having a pre-performance cocktail reception for Enron employees and guests to meet Mr. Sedaris.  Please mark your calendar for April 17, 2002!

As always, I greatly appreciate your input.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
Thank you,  
Misha

Yes to both questions.

Mr. Derrick, I am sending this email to you at the request of Mr. James Bouillion.  I understand you are already aware of the above as a copy of the EEOC charge was provided to you by Ms. Michelle Hoogendam Cash, and as Mr. Bouillion wrote to you regarding same on May 10, 2001 when he first learned about it from Ms. Cash.

Mr. Bouillion has consulted with our broker, and it is their recommendation that we formally place our carrier on "notice" of a "potential claim" situation as a "precautionary measure" to ensure that the reporting provisions of the insurance contract are met.  While the charge itself does not give rise to a "claim" under the policy, the broker feels that matters which involve the EEOC generally result in formal claims being pursued.  Thus, their recommendation to report to the carrier.

Please advise if you would like for us to formally report this matter to the broker so that they can notice our carrier.  If so, please let us know whether you want us to disclose to Ms. Cash the potential for insurance coverage in the event a claim(s) result from the allegations.  Thanks,

Dear Sir,

Re: Request for urgent mutual business Transaction

It is a pleasure to introduce myself to you. I am Mr.
Douglas Akin, an Accountant by profession with the
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and a member of
the Presidential (Petroleum) Task Force Committee set
by the present democratic Government in Nigeria, to
supervise the sales and award of Crude Oil contracts
through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC).

The Chairman with the entire members of this committee
have concluded every arrangement and now agreed to
transfer out of the country a total sum of $85,
500,000.00 (Eighty five million and Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars Only) to a reliable corporate or
private account oversea for mutual disbursement, hence
my reason to contact you. This amount is the excess
sum realized from sales of Crude Oil above the
government regulated price margin as a result of price
fluctuation, which we never rendered accurate sales
figures to the government for reasons you now know.

Benefits: At the successful conclusion of this
business, your good self shall be entitled to 20% of
the total sum remitted into your account for your
collaboration, 5% shall be set aside to defray all
expenses incurred during the transaction by both
parties and the balance of US$75% for the committee.
If you are interested in this business as I hope you
will, please contact me urgently at any of  the above
e-mail address or fax number, quoting our existing
secret code of this business, as Black & White, then,
I will revert back to you with detailed information.

Note: When dialing our fax, you do not need to add our
country code of 234. Just dial your international
access code, then followed by   our fax number. If you
are in Canada or USA, and outside the area code of
801, then omit 1 but add the 801. You may equally
e-mail us at the above e-mail address.

Yours sincerely,
Signed:
MR. DOUGLAS AKIN,
FOR & ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

Dear Friends:

May is drawing to an end and we have just completed the moving and
meaningful celebrations of commencement.   A total of 1,468 Liberal Arts
students received their diplomas.  In a few days, you will be able to

As students enroll in their courses for next year, the prevailing wisdom
seems to be that taking fewer hours will yield higher grades.  In fact,
the opposite is true.  According to a three-year study by the Office of
Admissions, students carrying 15-17 hours outperformed their classmates
taking 12-13 hours.  Nevertheless, the portion of students attempting
14-17 hours is decreasing (from 47.7% in 1996 to about 39% in 1999).
The correlation between 15-17 hour course load and a higher GPA was true
in all racial/ethnic groups and despite differences in academic ability
as measured by the SAT/ACT tests.  This is important information and you
can help by disseminating it widely - especially to current and incoming
students.  The University could serve many more students if students
moved through their college program in a shorter time.  College costs
would diminish and earning capacity would increase.

I have just returned from a wonderful visit to Midland, where Advisory
Council Vice-Chair Brian McLaughlin made sure I saw all that his
hometown has to offer.  We talked with prospective students at the
Trinity School and at Midland High School and Lee High School, had lunch
with fellow Advisory Council member Cadell Liedtke, and even visited the
Haley Library.

Successes abound:  S. Gail Caldwell, American Studies MA and BA alumna,
was just awarded a Pulitzer Prize in the area of Distinguished Criticism
for her "insightful observations on contemporary life and literature" in
The Boston Globe.  A cash award of $7,500 accompanies the prize.
Congratulations!

A trumpet fanfare, a classroom takeover, and a Texas-size check -- the
annual surprise Friar Centennial Teaching Fellowship goes to our own
Associate Dean Larry Carver.  The Friar Society is UT Austin's oldest
and most respected honor society, seeking to recognize professors who
reach out to undergraduate students in ways that exemplify true
dedication.  Carver was chosen because "he reaches students in his
classroom through his tireless efforts to ensure that material is
accessible, interesting and relevant.  He challenges students to revel
in great books."  With the award comes a check for $12,000. . . which
comes with the condition that the professor cancel class upon receipt of
the check.  Larry assures me that some of the award will be used to
increase the Pinto Carver Scholarship, the only endowment at the
University named for a cat.   See longer story with pictures at
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/news/releases/carver.html.

Philosophy professor Alex Mourelatos has been inducted into the Academy
of Athens, which cited his role in creating at UT a model program, the
joint classics/philosophy graduate program in ancient philosophy which
was launched in 1967.  This is the highest honor bestowed in Greece on
scientists and scholars in the fine arts and letters.

As students prepare for a summer in Winedale learning Shakespeare in the
most hands-on way possible, a new steering committee has been formed to
raise endowment funds to support this program in perpetuity.  Members
are Mike & Penny Cies, Greg & Brenda Hemphill, Royce & Elva Keilers, J.
Mark Metts, Dick and Judy Perkins, Ernie & Mary Gayle Stromberger, Eric
& Laura Thomas, Peyton & Carolyn Townsend, and Barbara & Milt Williams,
who will host the group's meeting at their restored home in Winedale
early in June.   Contact Clare Hudspeth at (512) 471-8861 if you want to
help or make a gift.

For those of you lucky enough to have been taught Shakespeare by James
B. Ayres, Ph.D., Shakespeare at Winedale Regents Professor, you might
want to send him a note of congratulations - "Doc" was just elected to
the Academy of Distinguished Teachers at the University of Texas.  The
academy, which totals only 70 members, is intended to recognize and
enhance teaching, especially at the undergraduate level.  Others from
Liberal Arts receiving this high honor are Mia E. Carter, Ph.D.,
Associate Professor in English, and Robert D. King, Ph.D., the Audre and
Bernard Rapoport Regents Chair of Jewish Studies, Department of
Linguistics.  Provost Sheldon Ekland-Olson described these as
"extraordinary teachers."  He went on to say, "Being selected is a clear
expression of the high regard colleagues hold for the new members'
dedication and contributions to teaching and to our students'
intellectual development."

As we talk about great teaching, I'd like to call your attention to an
exciting and important new program here in the College:  UTeach Liberal
Arts, which works with 65 students throughout their undergraduate years
as they pursue majors in English, Spanish, and the social sciences and
get hands-on experience learning to teach in local classrooms at the
same time.  You'll find an interesting article about this program at
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/alumni/initiatives/uteach.html.

Your responses to the questionnaire in the last newsletter were really
heartwarming, with many expressions of appreciation and affirmation.
The great majority wants us to keep the length and frequency of the
mailing as they are and to continue with the same content.  Some great
suggestions came as well: a request for reading lists, more info about
alumni achievements, stories about "average" students; and even ideas on
"what alumni can do to be of assistance."

In closing, let me pose another question: What do you consider the
greatest way in which a liberal arts education has enriched your life?
Send me a line or two on this topic and we may use some of your answers
in our outreach to students.

Thanks for this and for all you do for the College.  Have a happy and
healthy summer!

	Do you have any objection to Paulette moving with Elizabeth?

Don't know if you care about this, but my little group is moving to 50M in a couple of weeks (to your old area, i think).  There is apparently lots of empty space on 50M, so if you want to move Paulette over and let her be near us, that is fine with me.

Have a great weekend.

Tom, the quotation is fine.  With respect to the Law Firm information, I would like to have the names of the individuals at Andrews & Kurth, Bracewell & Patterson, Gibbs & Bruns, King & Spalding, Locke Liddell, and Vinson & Elins who have not yet contributed.  Thank you. Jim

Attached please find an electronic copy of a memorandum that I prepared this week in connection with the claim by International Gas Limited ("IGL") against Enron Exploration Company ("EEC").  The claim appears to relate to the recent execution of an upstream gas development "Term Sheet" in connection with Project Dolphin, and certain rights IGL believes it has to participate in the benefits of such Term Sheet pursuant to a May 18, 1994 Agreement that was executed between IGL and EEC in connection with Enron's earlier Qatar LNG Project.

I understand from discussions the other day with Bob Williams and Don Wendland of EOG Resources Inc. ("EOG") that EOG will in all likelihood ask Pettman Smith (IGL's counsel in London) for an extension of the requested April 16 response date.

If you have any questions or comments on this memorandum, or if I can be of further assistance in connection with this claim, please do not hesitate to call on me.

Marc, I met this morning with an acquaintance, Eric Johnson, with respect to a product that he thought might be of interest to Enron. In our discussion it became apparent that his product is not an obvious fit with Enron, and he asked about the possibility of discussing the product with the New Power Company.  I gave him your name and number with the thought that you might direct him to the appropriate individual on the business side.  Jim  

Michelle, thanks! Jim

Jim,  Forgive my delayed response, but I, too, will look forward to co-chairing next year's legal conference with David and to following in the impressive footprints of Michelle Cash and the 2001 committee.  Best regards, Michelle 

Jim,

I am looking forward to working with Michelle to Co-Chair the 2002 event.  We appreciate your confidence in us and are honored to be the Co-Chairs.   Michelle Cash and her team did set a high standard and also put in place the ground work to help ensure successful events for the future.  I know Michelle Cash has a notebook of information that she would like to pass on to the next Chairs.  We will schedule a meeting with Michelle Cash shortly.  

Regards,
David

Michelle and David, I would very much appreciate your serving as Co-Chairs of the 2002 Enron Legal Department Conference, which will be held at a Westin resort in the Dallas area. Michelle Cash and her team, of which the two of you were important members, have set an extremely high standard, but I know that you will do a superb job! Please let me know when you would like me to ask the various groups to select the members of your team.  Thank you! Jim

Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

Jim Hughes

Jim:  Thanks for forwarding this to me---this helps me with our ongoing (seemingly daily!) disclosure issues.  Considering the confidential nature of these litigation memos, and the fact that Andy probably doesn't know who the heck I am(and probably doesn't care!), would you ask him to include me on his distribution list?

Rob, thank you for the information.  Jim

Jim:

Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.

Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.

I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.

- Rob

Rob:

I've attached two documents:

First, an Excel Spreadsheet listing the number of judicial participants by
court and state. We do not ask the judges for their political affiliations.
In many states, the judges are elected in "nonpartisan" elections -- of
course, it is usually pretty clear who is what.  I imagine that there is a
"selection bias" toward more conservative judges -- however, even if there
is such a bias, our programs are still very valuable when in comes to making
our civil justice system more predictable.  Even the pro-business judges
need to understand how to articulate the economic reasoning that supports
their pro-business instincts.  We provide them with the tools to be more
effective.

Second, a generic description of Chapman from their P.R. office.  Rest
assured, the church does not play a major role in the University.

Also, I wanted to mention to you a significant connection between Chapman
University and Enron.  The most important player at Chapman is George L.
Argyros.  George is Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a very loyal
financial supporter of the University.  I will be Dean of the George L.
Argyros School of Business and Economics.  George has been nominated by
President Bush as Ambassador to Spain.

George Argyros is also Chairman Emeritus & Treasurer of the Horatio Alger
Association.  Kenneth L. Lay is Executive Vice President of the Horatio
Alger Association.

I suspect that Mr. Argyros and Mr. Lay have worked closely in their
leadership capacities with the Horatio Alger Association.

I would hope that this connection would result in a much larger contribution
to the Chapman LOEC.  Do you have any suggestions about how to proceed?

Checks should be made payable to "Chapman LOEC" and sent to me at the
address below.

Thanks for Enron's support.

Hope all is well with you.

Sincerely,

Henry

I am informed that you are travelling to India for the hearing in the MERC WP. Here's the latest, according to me.
The WP is expected to be listed fairly low down on the cause list (board or docket of the Court) for Monday 11 June 2001. In the normal course, I do not expect it will reach hearing on Monday. The Advocate-General has indicated that MSEB will be ready to go for a hearing on Monday. He said to AMS today that an affidavit of the MSEB will be served tomorrow on DPC (it will be Shobhan's office!). The Division Bench as per the assignment will take admission matters  (and ours is an admission matter) only on Mondays and Tuesdays of the week. Therefore if it appears at 2 p.m., when the Judges will rise for lunch, that the matter is unlikely to reach on Monday / Tuesday next week, an application will be made to the Judges at 2.45 p.m. (when the Court re-assembles after the lunch break) that the DPC WP be placed "High on Board" on tuesday so that it reaches hearing on that day. The urgency that will be pointed out is that MERC has kept the matter on 14 June 2001.
It is possible that when such aplication is made (or if the matter has reached int he normal course) that the Court may say that since this matter is likely to take time for hearing, it is better if it is set up for hearing on a day when the cause list of the Court is not inundated with admission work. If this happens, we are relegated to any day Wednesday onwards and it could even be beyond 14 June 2001. Obviously, in that case, if the next date is after 14 June 2001, suitable orders will be sought that the hearing before MERC on 14 June does not proceed.
I hope this clarifies the position here. Please feel free to contact me in case you need any further information.

will
be lively and informative.  One of the highlights is the Thursday afternoon
panel of Washington experts discussing the new political environment, as
well as
legislation and policy initiatives that we should be aware of.

If you have not done so already, please let us know if you plan on attending
the
Spring meeting by responding to this e-mail.

Jim,

I hope you and Carrin enjoyed your weekend in London and had a good trip back to Houston.

A couple of things:

- I wondered if it was clear yet when General Counsel meetings would be held prior to the conference, and whether those would be in Houston or San Antonio?

- how did Marcus Zwinger impress you? I would like to make him an offer, if you are agreeable.

- we are seeing a sudden increase in metals related arbitration claims. We intend to use two firms to assist with these - both are established shipping / commodities law firms: Holman Fenwick is one, Richards Butler is the other. Please let me know if we have any issues with either of those firms.

Many thanks.

							Mark

Mark, thank you for the message.  Carrin and I returned safely; we very much enjoyed our dinner with the two of you and look forward to reciprocating in Houston.  In response to your questions:  (1) the GCs will meet in San Antonio beginning on the Wednesay morning of the conference.  There will be no scheduled GC dinner the night before, but those GCs who are in San Antonio that night may get together for an informal one; (2) I enjoyed meeting Marcus; my only question relates to the amount of legal experience he has; as you know, we normally take individuals who have been practicing longer than he has practiced; if you are satisfied that he can do the job well, I will support your recommendation; and (3) I do not have any issues with either of the law firms you mentioned. All the best. Jim

Dear  Jim,
 
I have been working  with Tony Jarret (Director, Tax Research) and David Eldridge (IT, Tax  Department) at Enron; learning about Enron and how a knowledge management tool  could help everyone in Enron do their jobs more efficiently.  Presently, we  are very strong in the Legal Vertical due to the overwhelming amount of content  that lawyers deal with on a daily basis.  I have attached 3 documents that  you might find interesting, as they relate to the Legal Vertical.  Should  you have any questions, please contact me at your convenience.  I look  forward to learning more about the Enron Legal Department.

VINSON & ELKINS LABOR & EMPLOYMENT E-LERT
___________________________________________________________
Disregarding some federal cases to the contrary, the Supreme Court of Texas
has held that the correct standard of causation applicable in all TCHRA
discrimination cases is the "motivating factor" standard.  Accordingly, the
Court found that the trial court erred by refusing to give a "motivating
factor" instruction in this pretext case.  Prior federal court decisions
addressing Title VII "pretext" cases had required a plaintiff to demonstrate
that the protected characteristic was a "determining factor" in the decision
at issue. These federal cases indicated that the "motivating factor"
standard was applicable only to "mixed motive cases" in which the plaintiff
had direct evidence of discrimination.

Also troubling for Texas employers is the Court's secondary holding
regarding the plaintiff's evidence of age discrimination.  The company
terminated the plaintiff's employment for documented poor performance.
Because the plaintiff offered anecdotal evidence from co-workers suggesting
that he was a good performer, the court determined that he had produced
sufficient evidence of pretext to get to the jury, citing Reeves v.
Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., 120 S.Ct. 2097 (2000).  As suggested by the
dissenting judges, this holding could mean that a plaintiff can avoid
summary judgment in a poor performance case by producing some evidence of
positive performance feedback

Jeff, FYI. This is from Bill Urquhart, the lead litigation partner at the California law firm that is representing us in the Los Angeles litigation.  Jim

Hi Jim--

The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to breath.  We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours (since we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.

Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual pressure--with so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of esprit d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.

There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody minds repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you well know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.

There are so many benefits to this team approach.

1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any litigation is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.  Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not exposed to being discredited when the other side responds.

2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside) lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The business people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I should say that I could never understand that given the direct  Perhaps it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an unwavering focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels they are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the team can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That results in much, much lower legal bills.

3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so valuable.

4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.  Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask the dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron assignment goes to the top more often than not.

You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be proud of what they have built.

Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

Regards,

Bill

Bill, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your message.  Thank you for the feedback and for everything that you and your firm have done for us. I believe our respective organizations make a great team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All the best.  Jim

Gentlemen, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London (in connection with one of our mattters that was being heard by 5 of the Law Lords of the House of Lords) and found your message. I will coordinate travel plans with Bobby.  I am very honored to be included in this most memorable event. All the best.  Jim

Here is the proposed plan. Jim and Bobby should come over to Atlanta as
early as convenient on May 14. Lunch, maybe a few people who want to talk to
Jim, etc. We'll leave here to drive over (2 1/4 hours) to arrive about 6
p.m. for drinks and dinner.
Spend the night, play the next day, drive  back. Jim and  Bobby should let
us know what your return schedule to Houston would be, but later is better
so no one feels rushed.
	This should be great!

Dalton, I have just returned to the office from a business trip to London of almost two weeks and found your messsage.  I think it would be very interesting to hear from Dr. Brenner.  All the best. Jim 

	I am mindful that our guest speakers are ordinarily involved in the
legal profession in some manner.  Due to the May 1st date falling in the
final days of the legislative session, my efforts to get one of our key
legislators to speak in Houston on that day have been unavailing (all would
be anxious to do so at some later date).
	Consequently, I have tentatively arranged for Malcolm K. Brenner to
join us that day.  Dr. Brenner is a Professor in the  Department of
Pediatrics and Medicine, Section of Hematology-Oncology, at Baylor College
of Medicine.  Among other duties at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at
Baylor, Texas Children's Hospital and The Methodist Hospital, Dr. Brenner is
the Director of the Shell Center for Gene Therapy at Baylor.  My thought was
that you might find it interesting to hear what Dr. Brenner has to say about
where we  are and where we are going in the field of gene therapy.  He
recently made a similar presentation to our Board of Trustees, and it was
very well received.
	If anyone thinks it undesirable to depart from past practice in this
way, please say so.  Further, I will be happy to have anyone else that you
may suggest join us on May 1st in Dr. Brenner's stead.

Please print the message below.  Thank you.

Jim, I promised you some contact details.

Although I'm a little late with formal notification, as from the beginning of
the year I joined Societe Generale on a part-time basis.  I'm a Senior
International Adviser which means I do pretty much anything I want to turn my
hand to.  Jay Worenklein, who's the Global Head of Project Finance in New York,
is an old friend and we have always said that it would be fun to work together
if the opportunity ever arose.

In parallel with the SG role, I am continuing with the two roles for the British
Government I had previously mentioned to you: as adviser to the Deputy Prime
Minister and the Minister of Transport on the use of private finance in the
transport sector, and as non-executive Deputy Chairman of Partnerships UK, the
new merchant bank cum project developer the Government has formed to take
forward its well-known private finance programme.  So you can see that I've
finally ended up with the sort of portfolio we were discussing last fall.

Contact details are as follows:

Mobile              44 7802 655 605

At Partnerships UK  44 20 7273 8341 (direct)
               44 20 7273 8357 (my personal secretary - Carole James- who can
usually be relied upon to know where I am)
               44 20 7273 8383 (switch)

               e-mail:  adrian.montague@partnershipsuk.org.uk

At Societe Generale 44 20 7676 6821 (direct)
               44 20 7676 6881 (Nicola White - who tends to now where I am when
I'm at SG, or is a good point of call if Carole is not there)
               44 30 7676 6000 (switch)
               44 20 7667 2487 (fax)
               e-mail: as above

Since I move between offices a fair amount, if you send an e-mail, it's best to
send to both addressed at once.

All the best

Adrian

 In Ecuador, the anti-corruption and public ethics commission CCCC announced it has detected irregularities in the contract this country's state-owned oil company PetroEcuador signed with Arcadia, Texaco, Enron and Glencore, involving some 72,000 crude oil barrels per day production. The CCCC released a report it plans to pass to this country's General Attorney for its further anlysis.

Bob, congratulations on this matter and on the Baltimore matter.  In light of your admirable batting average, we may need to reinsert you in the CATS Litigation! All the best.  Jim

The reason we settled is that we had some exposure (the two mock juries both came back in favor of Linton, awarding an average of $1 million in damages), and the estimated cost of litigation through trial and appeal was $150,000-$175,000.  Our counsel, Tom Allen of Reed Smith, did an excellent job with the case, and I would recommend using him again.  Please call me with any questions.   

FYI

Jim and Ben:

As directors of Atlantic Water Trust, Arthur Andersen will request you to sign the AWT management representation letter.   As you might be aware, this year Enron is required to file the AWT 12/31/00 audited financial statements as an attachment to the Enron 10-K, due to the significant write-down of Azurix.     The current deadline of the audit and sign-off on the final AWT financial statements is March 27th.   The deadline is primarily driven by Azurix and the completion of their 10-K.   Therefore I anticipate that the representation letter you will be ask to sign, will not be circulated until later this month.  In the meantime if you have any questions or concerns please call.

Regards,

Mike Morrison 

Kate, I've just returned to Houston from a lengthy stay in London and found your message.  I have no objection to including any information that is pertinent to the firms' conflcits checks.  As to yoga, I do intend to try it as soon as my travel schedule permits.  All the best. Jim 

Jim - It's been suggested to me that we should include more information than just the list of all active entities that is currently distributed to the major Houston law firms (your list of contacts).  It's suggested that we should include (i) dba's, (ii) historical entities to include mergers and dissolutions, and (iii) name changes.  Please advise how you wish me to proceed and I'll look at packaging the information in the most compact manner although it's going to be bulky.  

Have you tried the yoga in the Body Shop yet?

Mark was going to discuss the matter with Peter and then get with me.  To m=
y knowledge, no decision has yet been made. Jim

Has a decision been made about this matter?

thanks, Vicki=20

Perhaps we could discuss this following the GC meeting tomorrow.  Jim

Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within En=
ron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity, =
EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some cr=
oss-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been decide=
d to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob Miln=
thorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two legal/gover=
nance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:

1.=09Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corpora=
te re-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada est=
ablished as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron Direc=
t will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was con=
sidering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada, =
with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers=
.  A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantl=
y, tax-related "permanent establishment" issues, that all directors and off=
icers of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.=
  Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of direct=
ors consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me =
(as the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the =
Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various=
 commercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise=
 with EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate=
 records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are =
Jim and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest Mc=
Nee.  I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees =
of EES are designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropria=
te to re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has bee=
n organized, or do you have concerns?

2.=09Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confi=
rm that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project =
was "grandfathered" on the basis that they were "up the learning curve" on =
a number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation=
 issues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Althoug=
h I was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute =
on some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Tor=
onto, Ernest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Ca=
nada will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly,=
 if not entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in r=
egulatory proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues af=
fecting the Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with t=
he licensing and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and =
given my understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been re=
latively limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young=
 continue on with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns,=
 and therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Peter

FYI.  It appears that this scam, which, as you know, we have seen in many letters over the years, has made its way onto the net.  I have advised Joannie that she should not respond to this.  Jim

Thought you should see this.

Thanks,
Joannie

Dear Friend,

I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed, the newly appointed head of
the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank
of Nigeria (CBN). I got your contact from a business
directory of your country and based on your business
activities and the type of investment I have in mind,
I found you to be the most suitable person for the
transaction stated below.

 Before I proceed, I want to strongly advice that you
devoid yourself from the general conception you have
about Nigerians. I would like you to carefully study
this proposal without bias, since it would be relevant
in our lives.

It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and
high-ranking government officials to divert
government's money into their private accounts; this
is usually done through CBN with the connivance of
senior officials. The ministers and military generals
especially during the era of late general sani Abacha,
achieve this by diverting most of the funds, meant for
the development of their respective agencies and
ministries into the CBN escrow accounts. Usually it is
this same escrow account that holds funds for the
payment of foreign contracts.  With the help of the
inside officials, the minister or senior government
officials and military generals would now create
themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign
partner to create them as artificial contractors,
using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money
to the nominated bank account of their foreign
partners. In this case the money is treated as payment
for foreign contract, and there is no trace. This is
how federal government's money is siphoned on a
regular basis, to the extent that most people now
result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge
they have about it.

Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the
central bank, he did not have enough time to perfect
and tidy up the transactions they have in place. So
the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow
account with no records. I just discovered this in a
bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of
our escrow account to the federal government and the
governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment.
I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow
account to declare to the government the total amount
that have been spent in the last three years and what
it was spent for. So,  in the course of carrying out
the above exercise, I discovered a total sum of
$150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to
anyone and with no records. My intention is to reveal
about USD $100M to the federal government so that I
can be in his good books and make arrangement to
transfer the outstanding USD $50M into a safe account
abroad. It is based on this that I am making this
urgent contact with you.

However, I am doing this because of the nature of my
job. I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more
so, there is no way I can remain in this office
forever. I have children to cater for even when I
retire as the director, which is just next year. So, I
need something tangible to fall back on when I retire.
Besides, if I declare the total funds to the
government, it would probably go into the pockets of a
few people that control the government. This is to
enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria.
So, do not blame me for my action because you would do
the same if you were in my shoes, knowing fully well
that there will be no compensation even if you
disclose everything to the government.

Well, I have discovered that I can transfer this money
if we could quickly create you as an artificial
contractor, by using your company document and Bank
account to receive the money, in the same way my
successor transferred theirs. The only difference is
that the final payment is going to be made to your
named company through any of our correspondent payment
center in Europe or America, due to the policies
adopted by the new democratic government.

The entire process is not easy, but it is achievable
due to my position in the foreign remittance
department of the CBN, and the relationship I have
with the present director of external payment and
finance of the federal ministry of finance.

The entire operation will be between the three of us:
(I) I shall take care of all documentation, (ii) My
friend in the federal ministry of finance will take
care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all
documentation, (iii) You shall take care of the
banking arrangements, provide the needed invoices to
enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as
the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment
center you shall be paid from.

After we have succeeded in transferring this funds,
20% shall be retained by you for your assistance, 5%
for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the
course of this transaction and the remaining 75% shall
be for me and my colleague, which we would possibly
invest in into your company or any viable business
venture you suggest.

If you are comfortable with this programme please
revert to me at once via telephone number
234-1-7593507 or fax number 234-1-7590440. Should your
response be positive, I would then instruct on the
next step to take.

Due to security reasons, when you call, do not ask for
any name, simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone
number. Once I reconfirm my number to be
234-1-7593507, you can then mention my name before you
go into any discussion. If I fail to reply correctly,
do not wait for a second trial, just drop the phone
and call back later.

We demand a quick response from you. Any delay might
result in contacting someone else. Irrespective of
what happens, we count on your maturity to keep the
transaction to yourself. So, you are advised to treat
this transaction with utmost confidentiality.

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Yours faithfully,

Dr Rasheed Mohammed

RW, I agree. JVD

	Jim -

	I think this is the final list.  If this looks ok to you we'll send it out and ask for topics.  Thanks.

Rob, the last time we spoke by e-mail about the general counsel group meeting before the law conference, you said you were checking with Vicki, Rex and Mark to see if they neded to add anyone else.  I have not heard anything more about that.  

Since we are having to firm up our reservation list at the hotel, I would like to get a final confirmation from you as to the attendees.  Here is the current list (which now includes Julia):

John Ale
Al Alexanderson
Rebecca Carter
Chuck Cheek
Jim Derrick
Mark Evans
Drew Fossum
Mark Haedicke
Elizabeth Labanowski
Mark Manley
Jordan Mintz
Kristina Mordaunt
Julia Murray
Eric Newell
Janet Place
Rex Rogers
Molly Sample
Vicki Sharp
Steven Wallace
Rob Walls

Jim said that he wanted this group to meeting on Wednesday, May 2.  Do you want lunch served in the room, or should we break for lunch?  Should either your assistant or Stephanie Harris be included?

Please confirm that this is the correct list.  Once I get that from you, I will send out an e-mail to the these people so that we can know how many rooms to reserve for Tuesday night.  Some people may want to come over Tuesday, while others may just fly over Wednesday morning.

Thanks for your help!

Bill and Mary, unfortunately, it appears that Carrin and I will not be able to attend after all.  An Enron Policy Committee (essentially, our executive committee, of which I am a member) meeting has been called for Monday, and I must attend it in person.  The flights from LA to Houston on Sunday night depart too early to enable us to attend the LA event, and the earliest flight on Monday morning arrives in Houston too late for me to attend the Policy Committee meeting timely.  We are extremely disappointed, as you may imagine.  We are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward to seeing both of you soon. We will watch the event on television in the hope that we see you being interviewed. I know you will represent us well! Let us know if your plans include a Houston trip--we would welcome the opportunity to entertain you.   All the best.  Jim
 

Hi Jim--

I just got back from San Francisco.  We are delighted you will be joining us.  It will be a fun night.

We are hiring limos to take us to and from the Shrine Auditorium.  Because both John Quinn and I live in Pasadena, the limos will be picking us up and dropping us off there.  Also, we are likely to have a dinner following the awards ceremony in Pasadena.  So--my recommendation would be for you to stay at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena.

Your voice message said that you have not finalized travel plans yet.  If you get out in time for dinner on Saturday, we should get together.  As soon as you have your reservations, give me a call or e-mail me.  My direct dial at work is 213-533-8667.  My cell phone is 818-519-8751.  Mary's cell is 818-519-8750.

I think it would be productive for you to spend some time with us on Monday morning.  know the people working on your matters would like to meet you.  Perhaps I could pick you up on the way to work on Monday.

Bill, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your
message.  Thank you for the feedback and for everything that you and your
firm have done for us. I believe our respective organizations make a great
team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond
memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the
GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had
the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All the
best.  Jim

    -----Original Message-----

   Hi Jim--

   The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to
   breath.  We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours (since
   we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the
   experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.

   Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual pressure--with
   so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you
   work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of esprit
   d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things
   easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.

   There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to
   solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking
   questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody minds
   repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside
   lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you well
   know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.

   There are so many benefits to this team approach.

   1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any litigation
   is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.
   Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not exposed
   to being discredited when the other side responds.

   2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they
   would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside)
   lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The business
   people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I
   should say that I could never understand that given the direct  Perhaps
   it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an unwavering
   focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels they
   are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the team
   can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever
   the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That
   results in much, much lower legal bills.

   3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so
   valuable.

   4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.
   Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask the
   dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the
   next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

   5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices
   to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron
   assignment goes to the top more often than not.

   You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be
   proud of what they have built.

   Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

   Bill

The Enron Advisory Council meeting is scheduled in Houston on April 10-11, 2001.  On Tuesday, April 10 a dinner meeting is scheduled at the Four Seasons in the Whitney Room (2nd Floor) beginning at 6:00 p.m.

On Wednesday, April 11 the Advisory Council will meet from 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.  in the Enron Boardroom.   You will receive a detailed agenda prior to the meeting.

Please let me know if you plan to attend.

Is this meant to cover invoices from outside counsel?  If it is, please discuss the proposal with Rob Walls.  Thank you. Jim

Just a reminder that we're looking for your input on the proposal outlined below.  Thanks!

I'm out of the office, but am monitoring my e-mail.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell
The Corp. design of the iBuyit system is well underway.  We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your "OK" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.

Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.
	
Level 1	Clerks/Sr. Clerks	$250		Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard
Level 2	Admins/Specialists	$500		Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot
Level 3	Sr. Specialist		$5,00		Computer, fax machine, furniture
Level 4	Manager		$25,000
Level 5	Director/Sr. Director	$100,000
Level 6	Vice President		$250,000
Level 7	Managing Director	$500,000
Level 8	EVP			$1.0M
Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.  

Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.

Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.

I appreciate your "OK" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell

Vanessa, I will attend. Jim

Bill, thank you.  I should have mentioned in my earlier message that my travel agent did tell me about that flight, but I determined that it was not practicable to rely on it for two reasons: (1) if it were to be cancelled, I would have no way of getting back in time for the Monday meeting, and (2) if it were not cancelled, the most-of-the-night journey back would not leave me in the condition I need to be in to participate effectively in the meeting. I do very much appreciate your efforts.  My best to you and Mary.  Jim 

Jim--

I just called my travel agent.  She says that Continental has a non-stop flight that leaves at 1:30 am and gets into Houston at 6:26 am.

Bill and Mary, unfortunately, it appears that Carrin and I will not be able
to attend after all.  An Enron Policy Committee (essentially, our executive
committee, of which I am a member) meeting has been called for Monday, and
I must attend it in person.  The flights from LA to Houston on Sunday night
depart too early to enable us to attend the LA event, and the earliest
flight on Monday morning arrives in Houston too late for me to attend the
Policy Committee meeting timely.  We are extremely disappointed, as you may
imagine.  We are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward
to seeing both of you soon. We will watch the event on television in the
hope that we see you being interviewed. I know you will represent us well!
Let us know if your plans include a Houston trip--we would welcome the
opportunity to entertain you.   All the best.  Jim

   Hi Jim--

   I just got back from San Francisco.  We are delighted you will be
   joining us.  It will be a fun night.

   We are hiring limos to take us to and from the Shrine Auditorium.
   Because both John Quinn and I live in Pasadena, the limos will be
   picking us up and dropping us off there.  Also, we are likely to have a
   dinner following the awards ceremony in Pasadena.  So--my recommendation
   would be for you to stay at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena.

   Your voice message said that you have not finalized travel plans yet.
   If you get out in time for dinner on Saturday, we should get together.
   As soon as you have your reservations, give me a call or e-mail me.  My
   direct dial at work is 213-533-8667.  My cell phone is 818-519-8751.
   Mary's cell is 818-519-8750.

   I think it would be productive for you to spend some time with us on
   Monday morning.  know the people working on your matters would like to
   meet you.  Perhaps I could pick you up on the way to work on Monday.

   Bill, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London and seen your
   message.  Thank you for the feedback and for everything that you and
   your
   firm have done for us. I believe our respective organizations make a
   great
   team!  Please give my and Carrin's best to your wife:  we have many fond
   memories of our time with the two of you and your other guests at the
   GRAMMY Awards.  Also, I mentioned to Jonathon Sumption, Q.C. that we had
   the honor of being represented by you; he is another of your fans.  All
   the
   best.  Jim

      Hi Jim--

      The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to
      breath.  We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours
   (since
      we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the
      experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.

      Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual
   pressure--with
      so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you
      work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of
   esprit
      d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things
      easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.

      There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to
      solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking
      questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody
   minds
      repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside
      lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you
   well
      know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.

      There are so many benefits to this team approach.

      1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any
   litigation
      is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.
      Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not
   exposed
      to being discredited when the other side responds.

      2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they
      would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside)
      lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The
   business
      people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I
      should say that I could never understand that given the direct
   Perhaps
      it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an
   unwavering
      focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels
   they
      are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the
   team
      can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever
      the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That
      results in much, much lower legal bills.

      3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so
      valuable.

      4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.
      Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask
   the
      dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to
   the
      next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

      5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are
   choices
      to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron
      assignment goes to the top more often than not.

      You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be
      proud of what they have built.

      Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

      Regards,

      Bill

Richard, I would like to meet with you re these claims and the others referred to in the message below to insure that we have all necessary information regarding them and have the appropriate legal counsel attending to them.  Thank you. Jim

A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.

1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile ("Codelco" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCC

This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.

Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal.

Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public.

 - LT010810084_3.doc 

2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation

Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde & Co.

3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House

Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.

4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport  LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)

Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).

NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.

5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse

Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

Kelly, I assume I am already on your list, but please let me know if you need any additional information from me.  Jim

We would like to add key legal personnel to the distribution list for deadline dates in connection with the Enron Corp. Board of Directors meeting on May 1st. Please reply via email and will we update our records accordingly.

Marc, thanks for the message.  I stipulate to having over-married--I'm very proud of that fact!  I'll pass the resume on to our Human Resources Group. All the best.  Jim

As you may know, Iam involved with Inprint Inc which very strongly supports
the Creative Writing Program and the U of H.  Chitra Divakaruni is a very
fine fiction writer who has been on the faculty and is now on leave.  We
very much want her to return.  The only stumbling block to her return is
her husband getting a good job here.  Attached below is his c.v. and a
letter of recommendation.  He appears to be very qualified and has good
experience.  If you have some suggestions for him, it would be greatly
appreciated.

I agree.

Hi Jim. Susan Bulgawicz asked for my assistance in the sale of one of the corporate aircraft -- N5737. Since the plane is financed and I have worked on the last 2-3 aircraft deals, there is a logical connection to my involvement. Susan and I both think that the best choice on legal representation is to continue working with the firm that represented Enron in the acquisition and original financing of the aircraft-- Akin Gump, rather than changing horses mid-stream. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Steph,I will attend this.

You are invited to attend a meeting this Friday at 10am to review current India issues with Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.  
The meeting is scheduled for 1 hour in EB50M03.

Marc, I have left a voice mail message for Ken regarding this and have asked him to call either me or you if he needs any additional information. I look forward to seeing you at the conference.  All the best.  Jim 

Jim:

	A heads-up.  Following up on our conversation last month about Ken Lay's untimely Form 4 filings, it is an item required to be disclosed in our annual Proxy.  As required by the rules, we have so disclosed it under "Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance" at page 17 of the draft Proxy distributed to the Board members earlier this week.  Presumably the notation that Ken has since filed the reports will make this a non-event and a mere technical violation, which, based on my review of other proxies, appears to be a common occurrence.    I leave it to you whether you wish to bring the required disclosure to Ken's attention.

	I trust that all is going well otherwise.  I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Enron Law conference.  I am slotted to speak to the group on Friday.  I may have a problem with joining you for the General Counsel meeting on the 2nd in that I have "required attendance Lockhart staff meeting" starting early the next day in Purchase.

                                                                                      Marc

Bruce and Gail,

I attach a rough first draft of the necessary Notice of Conciliation.

In its final form this needs to go in late tommorrow afternoon in New Delhi
if DPC is to be in a position to commence arbitration against the GOI as
quickly as is possible. There is any event 60 days of deadtime. There is no
sensible way of getting around that. Accordingly,the sooner DPC starts the
process,the sooner it gets to serve the necessary Notice of Arbitration.

It follows that if DPC wishes to get on with matters with the GOI as quickly
as is possible,this Notice of Conciliation requires to go in quickly.

Who does DPC wish to appoint as a conciliator (bearing in mind that DPC does
not genuinely wish to go through a full-blown conciliation,but simply wishes
to tee-up an arbitration on day 61)?

Laurence Street,whose name I have inserted,was the Chief Justice of NSW,and
is now in his mid-70s (but fairly fit and active; I saw him last at an ICCA
conference in New Delhi about 10 months ago). After ceasing to be a Judge he
did quite a lot arbitration. He was also the chairman (and an active
chairman) of Fairfax,a major Australian newspaper and media company and an
ASX component stock. Fairfax was the subject of a hostile bid,and had a
tough time with the Australian government.  As the chairman of Fairfax
Street has had some real business experience,but is also a pretty serious
lawyer. His main activity these days is mediation. He has done a lot of
it,mostly in high-profile Australian corporate disputes. If the conciliation
goes anywhere (which I tend to doubt) Street is about the most suitable
person I can think of at short notice.

If anyone has any better idea as to the identity of the conciliator,please
feel free to say so. If not,given that we have to cut quite quickly,my
suggestion and recommendation is that we go with Street.

Do you want to do this again?  If so, who do I invite.  I have forgotten who all were attending the last time.  S

Hello Stephanie,  how are you doing?  Can you check with Jim to see if we can come up with a date some time in May for a visit from Ed Feo, Eric Silverman and Mel?  I remembered that Jim had asked to wait until April to resume our efforts in tryng to schedule this.  Thanks.  Best regards.

Although this is a first draft, it will give you some indication of the relative strengths and weaknesses of our legal claims for termination as they exist today.  This is something you should read.    

Thanks.

Rob

Please find attached a first draft of the "Termination Roadmap" memo setting
out the various options for DPC in relation to the commencement of the
termination process and the choices it faces having initiated the process.
I am circulating this as a preliminary draft to lawyers only in the first
instance, in the knowledge that it probably needs to be refined (and
abbreviated) before it goes to wider circulation.
Please note also that it has been prepared without the benefit of having
seen the Godbole Committee Report (now out and on sale on the streets of
Bombay).
From a commercial point of view, of immediate interest is the analysis in
relation ot the decision on whether or not to complete the construction of
Phase II and whether or not to continue operation of the plant. On both
counts we identify significant risks to DPC of ceasing construction /
operation and we really should consider the overall termination strategy in
the round before decisions on this front are taken, however obvious the
answers may seem to be from a purely financial point of view.
The note is limited to the process under the PPA and coes not consider, for
instance, the influence of Lenders on the process or the role of the LNG
suppliers. It also ignores MetGas. I am happy to expand the note to cover
these aspects, and certainly in relation to the Lenders' position would need
and welcome Lance's collaboration.
Finally, I am also sure that changes will be necessary to take on board the
views of Gail and Christopher in relation to how the arbitration proceedings
would progress in parallel with the termination process. Part of what I have
written is based on discussions with Chris, but he has not yet had an
opportunity to look through the note itself having been preoccupied with
getting Notices of Arbitration out, and I would expect further changes once
he has had an opportunity to do so.

Congratulations, Bob and Michelle! Jim

In response to a "test case" declaratory judgment lawsuit filed by TGS (with our input) over one year ago, the Supreme Court of Argentina today issued an order enjoining the province of Santa Cruz from enforcing its stamp tax levy pending a full hearing and ruling by the Court on the legality of the stamp tax.  Although this is not a ruling on the merits, it does indicate how the Supreme Court is leaning, at least for the present.  This is a very significant victory for TGS and, if the Court continues in this direction, will result in TGS being relieved of stamp tax liability (approximately $650 million).  A great deal of the credit for this goes to Michelle Blaine, who worked with the TGS lawyers on the filing.  Please call me or Michelle with any questions.

How about:  May, 22, 23, 24, 29 or 30th?  S

Yes. The attendees are Mark Haedicke, Jordan Mintz, Kristina Mordaunt, Rex Rogers, Richard Sanders, Rob Walls, Bob Williams, and me.  Let's discuss the proposed dates in May before you take any action. Thank you.

Do you want to do this again?  If so, who do I invite.  I have forgotten who all were attending the last time.  S

Hello Stephanie,  how are you doing?  Can you check with Jim to see if we can come up with a date some time in May for a visit from Ed Feo, Eric Silverman and Mel?  I remembered that Jim had asked to wait until April to resume our efforts in tryng to schedule this.  Thanks.  Best regards.

Pat, as we know, February can be a very difficult month from the standpoint of weather, which affects not only travel to and from the event but also any outside activities during the event.  Do we have any flexibility with respect to the month in which the institute is held?  If it is to be held in February, I would opt to try Houston, New Orleans, or Santa Fe. I suggest that, if possible, we avoid scheduling the conference on Valentines Day or any holiday.  All the best.  Jim Derrick

Ann, I have left you a voice mail re your question.  Jim

I previously mentioned to you that Enron may have to enter into a consent d=

 transfer FCC licenses held by Portland General Corporation in connection w=

sked that we submit a proposed Compliance Program.  V&E prepared the attach=

l from Bob Mazer I have had the draft for a couple weeks and have not revie=
wed it until today.  I have spoken to a couple people in Regulatory Affairs=
 to see if they would be interested in taking ownership of this compliance =
program.  They don't want it. Sue Nord, who covers EBS for regulatory affai=
rs, is checking with outside counsel used by EBS to see if they agree that =
we must enter into the consent decree.  I am concerned about Enron's abilit=

===========================================================================
*  Investors appear to have been racing to sell ENE shares because of its
   apparent high P/E multiple (ignoring the considerable value of segments
   including Enron Energy Services, telecom and non-energy wholesale
   services) and misconceptions about a number of issues including its
   stalled asset disposition program (the Portland General Electric sale
   could be significantly delayed), the market position of its Indian power
   plant and California energy issues.  We believe that the current period
   of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy
   into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy.  We
   believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is
   undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by
   Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products,
   services and flexibility required by customers.  We believe these
   opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25% over the long term
   even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come
   close to reaching our expectations.

*  Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core
   businesses.  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf. call that
   it was 'very comfortable' with  ests of $1.70 to $1.75, we continue to
   be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our $1.80
   estimate.  Wholesale Services is likely to have an 'outstanding quarter'
   according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25% to 35% increase in natural gas
   volumes and a doubling of financial volumes.  Retail appears on track to
   achieve its $30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in
   2001 on a fully allocated basis.  Telecom has progressed at a slower
   pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to
   be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content
   business (now without Blockbuster as a partner) appears to also be
   developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000.  This said, the
   business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent.

   businesses.  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf. call that
   it was 'very comfortable' with  ests of $1.70 to $1.75, we continue to
   be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our $1.80
   estimate.  Wholesale Services is likely to have an 'outstanding quarter'
   according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25% to 35% increase in natural gas
   volumes and a doubling of financial volumes.  Retail appears on track to
   achieve its $30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in
   2001 on a fully allocated basis.  Telecom has progressed at a slower
   pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to
   be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content
   business (now without Blockbuster as a partner) appears to also be
   developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000.  This said, the
   business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent.

David, I have not heard from Tom Green; I will place another call to him. Jim

Thanks for the prompt reply, Jim.  I'm forwarding it to Pat now.  We will
run the final decision on this by the Executive Committee before we commit.

Incidentally, any word from Tom Green on the Tech Center?

David

Pat, as we know, February can be a very difficult month from the standpoint
of weather, which affects not only travel to and from the event but also
any outside activities during the event.  Do we have any flexibility with
respect to the month in which the institute is held?  If it is to be held
in February, I would opt to try Houston, New Orleans, or Santa Fe. I
suggest that, if possible, we avoid scheduling the conference on Valentines
Day or any holiday.  All the best.  Jim Derrick

Mary Nell, no one could have worked harder or better than you in the effort to bring about a just decision in this matter.  Thank you for your tireless efforts--I am proud to serve on the Enron team with you. All the best. Jim

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582.  Many thanks.

Kelly, there are no changes.  Thank you. Jim

Jim,  I cannot thank you enough for those incredibly kind words.  It will t=
ake a bit of time for my frustration to subside, but in the meantime we mus=
t carry on.  I am arranging a meeting with Jonathan to see if he can shed s=
ome light on this strange opinion and on why we were denied our costs on th=
e restitution point.  He may not be available until after Easter.  I have s=
poken to Laurence who describes the opinion as pathetic.  Perhaps even more=
 interesting and somewhat troubling is the fact that it was actually Pollac=
k who said to Laurence that Enron had been "stitched up" by the Lords and t=
hat the opinion was a joke.  I do not want to sound like a sore loser, but =
it does make one think this is a bit of a kangaroo court if the winning cou=
nsel says the result is a joke.  Anyway, it is not a very funny one.  In al=
l seriousness perhaps we should consider whether we ought to modify our pol=
icy permitting submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English cour=
ts.  I realize they have not historically honored the non-exclusive jurisdi=
ction clauses, but at least it might give us a fighting chance to go to a m=
ore neutral venue like Switzerland.  Anyway, give it some thought.  I will =
let you know as soon as I have been able to speak with Jonathan.  Again, ma=
ny thanks for your wonderful support every step of the way.

Mary Nell, no one could have worked harder or better than you in the effort=

Dear Dean Rogers:
	

	I would very much appreciate your forwarding the attachment to the appropriate individuals at the Law School. I am most grateful for your assistance.

	Sincerely yours,

Please print the attachment.  Thank you.

Jim,

Here is an introduction for our meeting tomorrow.  I will be prepared to answer any questions you have about the litigation.  Thanks.

Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston and working full time co-heading the Global LNG group as of April 20.  The LNG market looks very promising and the team has already done a number of spot cargoes.   
With that evolution we will make the following changes:  the Spanish team headed by Mariano Gentilini, will now report to Eric Shaw who will then have origination responsibilities for the entire origination and asset development efforts on the European Continent.  The Spanish energy markets are becoming increasingly integrated into the neighbouring continental energy markets, with significant cross border opportunities and we expect these changes to help us maximise our information sharing and cross-border opportunities.
The Arcos power station development effort has made significant progress over the past few years under Eric Gonzales's leadership.  We are entering the final permitting stage, and we expect to begin construction by the end of this year.  We would like to thank Eric for his contribution over the past three years, and we are confident that the strong team he has built will successfully complete this critical project.  In addition to his Country Head responsibilities for Spain and Portugal, Mariano will continue to lead the Arcos development effort. 

Please let me have your comments.  Thank you.
The Corp. design of the iBuyit system is well underway.  We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your "OK" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.

Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.
	
Level 1	Clerks/Sr. Clerks	$250		Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard
Level 2	Admins/Specialists	$500		Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot
Level 3	Sr. Specialist		$5,00		Computer, fax machine, furniture
Level 4	Manager		$25,000
Level 5	Director/Sr. Director	$100,000
Level 6	Vice President		$250,000
Level 7	Managing Director	$500,000
Level 8	EVP			$1.0M
Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.  

Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.

Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.

I appreciate your "OK" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell

I am managing a dispute here in Singapore involving the tenancy of one of our expats (John Chismar). Essentially, there was an agreement for an early termination on 31 May 2001, but the Landlord is now seeking to "rescind" the early termination agreement on grounds that we have allegedly prevented his contractors from inspecting the premises thereby breaching a condition of  termination agreement. 

I am of the view that the allegations are without merit but there is significant acrimony with the Landlord and all attempts at reasoning with him have failed. John Chismar is of course adamant about moving out and has in fact agreed to a new lease of different premises. The Landlord (who is an ex-lawyer) is likely to be uncooperative when we try to hand over at the end of the month and withhold the deposit of S$42,750 (approx. US$24,000) and try to sue for rent.

In anticipation of litigation, I would like to instruct external counsel to help me manage this matter. I took the liberty to mention this to John C and he is agreeable to the course of action.

I would like to propose Hri Kumar of Drew & Napier whom I have worked with and instructed for similar matters in my previous employment. Drew & Napier is a prominent law firm in Singapore (especially for litigation). They have a joint venture with Freshfields of the UK which operate here in Singapore as Freshfields Drew & Napier dealing with high end corporate work. However, I note that Drew & Napier is not on our approved list of external counsel and write for your approval that I instruct them for this matter.

Please print the message and the attachment.  Thank you.

I attach a more developed (if longer) version of the proposed Notice of
Arbitration.

I would be grateful if Paul Kraske and his team could assist Andrew House in
verifying the facts, dates or events etc. indicated in the text.

Assuming that the PFM notice is served tomorrow, I should be grateful if a
copy could be sent at that time to the GOM demanding written confirmation of
the immediate cessation of all adverse activities complained of in the PFM,
the confirmation to reach DPC by 12:00 hours 1ST on 9th April 2001 (failing
which an arbitration will be commenced immediately against the GOM). My
point is this no such confirmation will be forthcoming, and even if it were
we would go ahead anyway. For formalistic purposes I simply wish to
crystallise in written form the existence of the disputes as between DPC and
the GOM.

We next need a 60-day notice under Clause 17.4(d) of the PPA.

After reading and rereading the revised version I have decided to go with
the revised version without making any changes. I belive that it accuratly
sums up the reasons for my academic shorcommings that have plagued my
college years at Ole Miss. I hope that things will work out so that I can
set the record straight and make my family proud. I want to think you again
for being such an anchor in my life. I wish you could come back to Madrid
for a couple of days and hang out. The weather is truly inspiring. Primavera

we went to the Thyssien and it mad me reminisce about what a wonderful time
I had with you here. I look forward to the next time. I am also very happy
to hear of the positive results stemming from Carrin?s trip to another one

Thank you for the reply.  We have no further comments.  Jim

No, these limits would only to apply to items in the electronic catalog, which wouldn't include outside services.  As it now stands, the system will be used for procurement of items like office supplies, catering, computers, etc.

Thanks!

Is this meant to cover invoices from outside counsel?  If it is, please discuss the proposal with Rob Walls.  Thank you. Jim

Just a reminder that we're looking for your input on the proposal outlined below.  Thanks!

I'm out of the office, but am monitoring my e-mail.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell
The Corp. design of the iBuyit system is well underway.  We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your "OK" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.

Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.
	
Level 1	Clerks/Sr. Clerks	$250		Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard
Level 2	Admins/Specialists	$500		Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot
Level 3	Sr. Specialist		$5,00		Computer, fax machine, furniture
Level 4	Manager		$25,000
Level 5	Director/Sr. Director	$100,000
Level 6	Vice President		$250,000
Level 7	Managing Director	$500,000
Level 8	EVP			$1.0M
Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.  

Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.

Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.

I appreciate your "OK" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell

I think you would be a great candidate.

any interest?

Rob, I'm on the committee putting together this year's Power Institute sponsored by the South Texas College of Law.  As we do not have any speakers from Enron scheduled this year, I thought I would check with you to see if there is any interest in participating on the general counsel panel referenced in the proposed agenda contained in the attached fax.  Please let me know as soon as possible, as they apparently plan to finalize the agenda today.  Thanks.

Christopher -

I agree with your observations.  It seems to me that we want to consolidate
our Dec/Jan/Good Interest into one arbitration against each of MSEB and
GOM, rather than separate the claims further and thereby encourage MSEB/GOM
to cure some claims (e.g., Dec/Good Interest) and leave the January claim
hanging out there alone.

I understand your issues with rag-tag but am assuming that the rag-tag
label does not apply to Good Interest.

Thanks,
Bruce

Bruce,

I think that part of the plan discussed in London has simply been
superceded
by events. In particular,the corporate decision about what the end game and
desired end result are to consist in.

Accordingly,I now look upon the proposed GOM and MSEB arbitrations as
primarily a means of setting up the case for PPA termination in due course.
In the light of this:-

(1) The MSEB arbitration ought now to deal with misdeclaration and claim
payment of the January 2001 billing,as well as the December 2001 billing. I
expect that we shall also put in the subsequent misdeclaration episodes. I
see little value in putting in the older claims (i.e., the arrears and sums
withheld),mainly because Kelly Quinn's analysis of them tends to show that
many of DPC's claims are dud.

(2) There is no longer any useful purpose served in stripping the MSEB
arbitration down to misdeclaration only. Further,not merely I am more
convinced than I was that the MSEB was not entitled to withhold against the
December 2000 billing,but I think that DPC has a 50:50 case that the MSEB
was obliged to pay the January 2001 billing clean.

(3) As I see it,there will be two arbitrations against GOM (the SSA and the
Guarantee) and one against the MSEB. However,if we wish to harass the GOM
and set up further PPA termination grounds,we might well wish to do
something forceful and litigious when (as I confidently predict) the notice
under the escrow agreement is not responded to by the MSEB and the Indian
banks. The notice only really works as and when the Indian banks are
threatened.

Christopher -

Help me to understand the plan for the MSEB and GOM arbitrations for
December, January and Interest.  In how many pieces do we anticipate
submitting these arbitrations?  What strategy is behind the submission of
separate submissions?

I remember that we wanted to separate the MSEB January submission, at one
point, to hasten the disposition of the misdeclaration issue.  Does this
make sense given the events of the last few weeks and the sponsors'
sentiments about additional capital for the project?

Thanks,
Bruce

Bruce, I am supportive of the team's engaging Justice Bhagwati.  Jim

Jim -

Pursuant to my e-mail, here is some information on one of the three
potential GOM/GOI arbitrator candidates that we want to approach.  I don't
have detailed information abou the other two but hope to have something
more by Monday.

Let me know if you have comments or concerns.

Thanks,
Bruce

Bruce,

Justice PN Bhagwati
For many years he was the Chief Justice of India - and was responsible for
many of the landmark decisions passed by the Supreme Court. After
retirement
from the Supreme Court he has pursued a career as an arbitrator and has
been
involved on a number of international arbitrations. As a separate career he
provides legal opinions on commercial matters. He is currently recognised
as
one of if not the outstanding senior lawyers in India. He with Justice
Chandrachud are probably India's best known arbitrators.

Has an outstanding reputation as an intellect to be reckoned with - in the
conferences I have had with him (on Metgas) and in Chris and Atul's
dealings
with him you have to marvel at his speed of thought despite the years.

Our primary concern with him appearing on the other side either for GOI or
GOM as their arbitrator, apart from his capability, is the simple fact that
he is extremely busy. If GOI or GOM want to slow down an arbitration
proceeding then in Atul's words "there can be no better choice than Mr
Bhagwati".

He has chaired several commissions - eg he wrote the revised Takeover Code.
He has also been responsible for much of the insolvency legislation.

I don't have sufficient details on Justices Chandrachud and Chandurkar and
could I please ask Chris to forward these to Bruce.

Sandeep

Steph, am I available on the 17th?

Mr. Derrick,

Our firm has been retained by Enron on a variety of matters over the last few years but we have not yet met.  I will be in your Houston offices on Tuesday, April 17th.  I am writing to ask if you would be available to meet sometime that afternoon.

You may recall meeting my partner, Mike Morgan, in Portland about three to four years ago.  Mike has worked with Enron on the PGE/Sierra deal and other matters as well.

I am the senior partner at our firm who specializes in labor and employment law.  I am a former partner at Littler Mendelson in San Francisco and continue to enjoy a close relationship with that firm.

I have been working with Rick Johnson, Director of Labor and Employment Relations at Enron Corp.  We have been handling the labor issues associated with an energy management agreement--Project Neon.  Rich Freed is lead counsel.  We are working on a project labor agreement in connection with the construction of a power plant--Project Epic.  Randy Pais is overseeing that matter.  We are also working with Marty Keyser on some potential  O & M issues at EFS.

On April 17th, I will be having lunch with Michelle Cash, Sharon Butcher, Kriste Sullivan and Rick.  In the morning I will be meeting with representatives of EFS, EES and EEOS.

My flight on the 17th leaves at about 5:30 pm.  Rick and I would be available to stop by your office sometime after lunch on the 17th.

Please let me know if you are available to meet with us.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Victor Kisch

I believe the committee has earned the right by its work to select the name. Jim

any preference?

We really need to get an official name for the Portal. The finalists are:  

Enron Legal Edge 
Enron Legal Net
Enron Legal Source
EnLaw
Enron Legal Ease (copyright issues?) 

Who is going to pick this...Mr. Derrick, the GC's or the committee? 

I understand that you will only have a few introductory comments on the Portal rather than a 15 minute presentation. I will be meeting with you Thursday, and we can talk about what type of slides I can prepare for you to go along with your comments. We will have a Portal Demo outside the ballroom where the participants can see the demo and be provided with information on the categories. We have a new graphic design for the Portal Header which you can see below. Let me know your thoughts?

Sheila, Stephanie has reminded me of an event that conflicts with June 7 & 8. However, June 4 or June 5 would seem to work. Jim

Jim, I will check with the General Counsel of the various Enron companies and see if Thursday, June 7th or Friday, June 8th is agreeable.  This will give us some time to review the Corporate Legal employees that will be discussed in this meeting and also give the Business Units some time to gather their feedback.  Will let you know.  Thanks.

Sheila Walton 

I am currently available the week of June 4.  With respect to Corporate Legal, and subject to your thoughts, I suggest we meet with Rex Rogers and Chuck Cheek. Jim

Jim and Rob,

As you know, mid-year 2001 PRC is right around the corner and the scheduled meeting dates are be  from June 4-29th.  Please let me know 2 or 3 meeting dates when you would be available to have your Mid Year PRC meeting.  We would need to schedule a date for Corporate Legal and also a date to discuss the functional legal professionals throughout Enron.  I would also need to know what committee members we would need to invite for the Corporate Legal meeting.  I have a list of attendees from last year end PRC meeting.  I will send you those names for your revisions. 

Please let me know as soon as possible the preferred dates and start times so that we can avoid conflict when trying to schedule other meetings.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 3-0649.  

Thanks,
Sheila Walton

You've got yourself marked out for "PV".   BTW, I know tomorrow is a Tuesday, but I have moved Mr. McCartney several times and he has had conflicts and had to change also.  This is the only time.  He is coming at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.  OK?  S

Steph, am I available on the 17th?

Mr. Derrick,

Our firm has been retained by Enron on a variety of matters over the last few years but we have not yet met.  I will be in your Houston offices on Tuesday, April 17th.  I am writing to ask if you would be available to meet sometime that afternoon.

You may recall meeting my partner, Mike Morgan, in Portland about three to four years ago.  Mike has worked with Enron on the PGE/Sierra deal and other matters as well.

I am the senior partner at our firm who specializes in labor and employment law.  I am a former partner at Littler Mendelson in San Francisco and continue to enjoy a close relationship with that firm.

I have been working with Rick Johnson, Director of Labor and Employment Relations at Enron Corp.  We have been handling the labor issues associated with an energy management agreement--Project Neon.  Rich Freed is lead counsel.  We are working on a project labor agreement in connection with the construction of a power plant--Project Epic.  Randy Pais is overseeing that matter.  We are also working with Marty Keyser on some potential  O & M issues at EFS.

On April 17th, I will be having lunch with Michelle Cash, Sharon Butcher, Kriste Sullivan and Rick.  In the morning I will be meeting with representatives of EFS, EES and EEOS.

My flight on the 17th leaves at about 5:30 pm.  Rick and I would be available to stop by your office sometime after lunch on the 17th.

Please let me know if you are available to meet with us.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Victor Kisch

Michelle, Great News! Congratulations to the team. Jim

Hurray!  More good news from Argentina!  Today the Argentine Supreme Court granted TGS an injunction against payment of the stamp tax assessed by the Province of Rio Negro pending resolution of the matter.  Rio Negro recently rejected TGS's final administrative appeal against payment of the tax with penalties and interest in the amount of US $436 million!  Rio Negro had ordered payment by April 26 and threatened to commence collection proceedings.  Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS an injunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17 million which was unprecedented.

Dodged another bullet!
Cheers!
Michelle

Rex, please proceed with the meetings.  Thank you. Jim

JVD:  I left you a voice mail re these general issues.  Because of the confusion of the day, and because the Wilmer Cutler folks are here, does it make sense to meet with them at least once a day to coordinate our disclosure throughout the Company?   Rex

We have received the following questions from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.  We will not necessarily respond, but would you please provide answers and let me know your view whether or not we should respond to the following:

Have you had any further contact from Fitch? (DeSpain)

Has there been a change in status to the SEC inquiry?  Which office is handling - Fort Worth? (Rogers)

Have you been contacted by the Federal Reserve or any other agency conducting an investigation? (Rogers)

Have you been in contact with or retained bankruptcy counsel? (Haedicke)

Have you been contacted about a takeover - Royal Dutch, GE?

Have you retained Goldman Sachs to advise you on credit rating, financing issues or to find a strategic partner?  Will they receive an equity stake to help Enron get out of its current situation?  (Bowen)

These reporters are on deadline tonight, so let me know as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Today, the Corporate Secretary Department began receiving large amounts of registered mail which already has been signed for in the mailroom and delivered to us.  Chuck Cheek tells us that his Litigation Group should not receive these letters and will not be directly involved. 

We are just trying to ascertain to whom (individual/department/outside counsel) should this mail be directed.  

When we get an answer, we will pass the word and give the mailroom proper instructions.  It is my understanding that many of the officers on 50 also are receiving these letters.  We will need to notify all of the proper procedure.

experts in both commercial and application software development with
experience implementing industry standard methodologies. We provide
unbeatable rates on quality engineers with a proven track record of success
in J2EE, XML, SOAP and Web Services.

Our rates start at $6/hr for offshore and $19/hr for onsite. We are
committed to 100% satisfaction and guarantee completely the quality of our

person/people, as I am certain they will find this offer very attractive.
If you'd prefer not to be considered for this, please let me know.

Jim -

I'm attaching an e-mail from Chris Walker and a letter from Arthur
Marriott.

Arthur has been invited by the 2 existing arbitrators to act as the third
arbitrator in the existing GOI Guarantee arbitration.  Christopher supports
Arthur's participation.

However, Arthur and his firm have some Enron involvement.  First, he
represents Shell on the Cuiba project.  Second, some of Arthur's partners
(and not Arthur) have been advising some of the Indian lenders on aspects
of NY law.  Neither of these representations particularly bother
Christopher but he wants to make sure that it does not bother Enron.

Can you let me know today if you believe that these issues present a
problem for Arthur acting as the 3rd arbitrator?

Thanks,
Bruce

Bruce,

In order to stand this one up for 9th November 2001, I am going to need to
go back to Arthur Marriott QC tommorrow. Can you let me know whether you
foresee any difficulty with the potential conflicts to which he refers.

Jim, Bob Williams (full name:  Robert C. Williams), ext. 52402,  will be the Enron litigation coordinator for these matters. 

You have confirmed by voice mail that V&E have been retained to defend the recent share holder derivative litigation.  To date, we have been made aware of six (6) lawsuits which have been noticed to underwriters.  

I am receiving requests from V&E for copies of policies and other information and we have responded.  Normally,  V&E would be working through an Enron attorney and we would like to know if internal counsel has been appointed in this matter so that we can provide copies for their file as well. Please advise.

   We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2
   meeting is canceled so they can free next Friday up on their

   Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you propose

   contact them myself and simply tell them to stand by for more

   RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

   Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have
determined
   to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date.
I
   hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have
already
   made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

   Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
   date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
   <mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of
your
   availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
   originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
   followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

   a) ____________

   b) ____________

   c) ____________

   d) ____________

   After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting
for
   the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members
and
   notify you of the new date.

   Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that
we
   have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
   I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Bob, please respond to Bill.  Thank you. Jim

Does this include the suspension of the automatic email deletion policy?

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Sandra, I am experiencing difficulty in opening the attachment.  Could you please fax the information to me at 713-853-3920? Thank you. Jim

Jim - There is another article in preparation by the NY Times.  Pls. see the angle of their questions below.  PHR

Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:

Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as "security brokers, dealers & flotation" when before it had said it was in the business of "wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products"?

Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 

Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 

Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 

I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me?

Dave, thank you for the suggestion.  I will ask V&E to draft a memo.  All the best. Jim

There are lots of employees wondering if/how they should react to all the class actions being filed, esp. those that are filed with employee plaintiffs and /or relate to benefit plans. It might be helpful to let people know how class actions work, that they don't need to sign up to be lead plaintiffs, that if awards or settlements occur they will have a chance to participate later, will be notified, etc. This might calm people down and avoid a stampede if rumors start flying around that if people don't sign up or join now they will be left out. 
  I look forward to seeing you at lunch. We can make it quick or even in office if your schedule is making lunch difficult. - - -DLH

I am the director over the North and South American remote sites.  My team is directly and indirectly involved in backups of voice and data for these sites.  Is there someone I should be working with to determine what to do at these sites ?

Hi Bruce,
    That's where I was heading.  Either I save everything on the tapes or nothing.  I don't think anything pertaining to LJM is applicable here.
Thanks,
Mike 

Mike -

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is "preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify".

Thank you, Steph.  

JVD, just wanted to tell you how much I am enjoying my little medicine ball.  I walk around with it a lot.  When I am on the telephone, it substitutes for a doodle.  As a matter of fact, I just got back from doing the stairs and on about the second floor, I realized I was holding it. It has kind of taken the place of a "worry rock" .  In the meantime, it is providing me with the much needed strength and dexterity in my arm, wrist and hand.  

Thanks again for all you do for me.  I love working for you.  You are a very sweet man and I appreciate it.

Jim,

We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2
meeting is canceled so they can free next Friday up on their calendars.

Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you propose
and made any other modifications you wish), or would you rather I
contact them myself and simply tell them to stand by for more
information?

Thanks.

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a) ____________

b) ____________

c) ____________

d) ____________

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

I am not yet certain about the Austin trip.

Do you still want to make the trip to Dallas for the Southwestern Legal Foundation on Friday, November 2?

Travel to Austin for Trustees mtg. on the nights of Thursday, November 8, 9, 10 and checkout on 11th?

My heartfelt thanks to every member of the team.  All the best. Jim

Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF   

FYI
A friend of mine, Jim McCloskey, a Director at Ernst & Young, mentioned to me that one of his partners and former Vice Chairman of E&Y, Bob Herdman, was recently named Chief Accountant to the SEC and asked whether E&Y could be of any assistance with respect to the present SEC inquiry.  I told Jim that I would convey his request to the appropriate personnel.  If you or any one wanted to discuss this matter further with Jim he can be reached at 713-750-8206.

I do know that Jim had met with Jeff Skilling earlier this year to talk about opportunities in E&Y working with Enron and I think he has another meeting scheduled  in November with Rick Causey and others for a follow up presentation, all unrelated to the SEC inquiry.

Regards,

Scott Dieball    

RW, I assume you will look into this.  Thank you.

	
Jim and Rob,
 
I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in a position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below to your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom line is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not even responding to my requests for information.
 
I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already causing me serious  problems and potential losses.
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Thanks and hope to see you soon.
 
Diomedes.
 
Mary Joyce,
 
I hope all is well with you. 
 
I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.
 
After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November". 
 
As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.
 
These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.
 
Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.
 
I look forward to hearing from you,
 
Regards,
 
 
Diomedes Christodoulou.

Tracy, thank you for the message.  We are not having the conference call tomorrow.  Jim Derrick

Please accept Mark Evans' apologies, he will be on vacation tomorrow and therefore unable to join the scheduled weekly conference call.

I understand from Janet Place that this is not a Northern Border project but rather a North America project and that she is leaving you a voice mail regarding this.  I assume that either you or Andy Edison will follow up.  Thank you. JIm

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Based on the facts set forth below, I agree.  Jim Derrick

We should definitely take the pay-out.

The car was stolen on May 2001 and PZU compensation paid  on Oct. 2001 will be 131 500 PLN
The market value on Oct 2001 is 95 000PLN

what is the amount of the compensation PZU is to pay ENS vs the market value vs the insured amount ?

Dear All,

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.

Dear Professor Hu, thank you for your message.  Your participation by telephone, for whatever portion of your afternoon might be free, would be very welcome.  I currently plan to be in Austin for the UT Law School Foundation Board meeting and related matters on November 9 and 10.  Perhaps our paths will cross there.  All the best.  Jim Derrick

Dear Mr. Derrick:

	Thank you for including me in this venture.  It promises to be fun and
useful.  Unfortunately, in terms of the November 2nd meeting, a faculty
candidate I'm primarily responsible for is coming through the law school
the same day.  He is giving a colloquium late morning/early afternoon and
my wife and I are hosting the dinner for him and his wife that evening.
So, especially given the post-9/11 logistics, it doesn't seem practical for
me to come to Dallas for this meeting.  One possibility might be for me to
participate by phone for a portion of the afternoon meeting and I would be
happy to do so.  But given the nature and length of the meeting, this
probably doesn't make sense - please let me know what you think.

	Best regards.

Jim/Rob -

Given the number of litigation issues, the Linklaters Dabhol team needs another senior lawyer to help lead various efforts (which I have advocated).  Christopher Walker has recommended that Greg Reid of Linklaters join the team.  I believe that Greg is currently head of Linklaters International Arbitration group.

I've spoken with Barry Hunsaker and Stephen Wallace regarding Greg.  Both had very favorable things to say about Greg:  Hard-working, detail-oriented, smart, etc.  Neither of them had any reservations about Greg although he apparently does have a sharp sense of humor (so I can see why he and Chris get along).

Greg would not handle the "India side" of the litigation efforts which would remain with Chris.  He would help with the "London side" and the lender enforcement side (to the extent that occurs outside India).  In any event, Chris would remain as the leader of the overall litigation effort and we will expect Chris to keep tabs on matters Greg is handling to ensure the overall coordination of the effort.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to Greg's involvement.

Bruce

 
Dear Mr Lundstrom,

from discussions with my partner, Sandeep Katwala, I understand that as the
number of issues and proceedings arising out of the Dahbol project continue
to proliferate we need to increase the partner resources devoted to the
matter.

I attach a short cv giving my professional and academic background. I have
been at Linklaters for 16 years doing litigation and arbitration . For the
last 2 years I have been co-ordinating L&A's European arbitration practice,
but have, in the past, worked closely with Chris Walker. I have also had
considerable exposure to power projects, both domestic and international
(including an involvement in the Appeal to the Supreme Court in Pakistan on
the Hub project).

Last year I successfully completed a significant arbitration for EOG. Please
feel free to call Barry Hunsaker at EOG if you would like more background on
that job. I am presently acting on a much smaller matter for Enron (taking
instructions from Stephen Wallace) that comes to hearing in London on 8/9
November.

I am presently based in Paris, but spend about one third of my time in our
London office. This is increasing and, as a result, I will be moving back to
London in July/August of next year. If you have any questions regarding my
suitability to join the team on the Dahbol project please do not hesitate to
call me direct.

yours sincerely

Folks -

Some background on our presiding arbitrator for the GOI arbitrator.

Bruce

 
Bruce,

Herewith the bio(hagio)graphical details of Arthur Marriott QC from the
Debevoise & Plimpton website.

My experiences of Arthur Marriott QC as a presiding arbitrator are good. He
is not a lawyer of the same calibre as Lord Mustill or Andrew Rogers QC (nor
would he,I think,claim to be).  But he is very practical and knows what he
is doing.  He wants to get on with things where he can. He is also quite
adroit at managing tribunals. That is almost certainly going to prove to be
a necessary skill with Kamal Hossain who will see his role as advocating the
GOI's position and engineering whatever delay the GOI wants. I am hopeful
that (eventually) Kamal Hossain will overplay his hand,which will leave
us,in practical terms,with a Rogers-Marriott tribunal.

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

I'm attaching a copy of Azurix's Request for Arbitration with ICSID in Washington relating to Azurix Buenos Aires.  The claim should be formally registered (i.e., cleared as valid for jurisdicitional purposes) today or early next week.

 

King and Spalding put together a summary of the various themes to emphasize in the arbitration.  Much of it is quotations from provincial officials, in official reports or to the press, demonstrating the political nature of the Province's decisions.  This should give you a flavor of our case.

				Emilio,

				I think you should proceed.  Could you send me a resume?

				Jim, our two lawyers at Azurix Buenos Aires have needed some assistance in handling routine matters, given that most of Emilio's time is taken up with the termination issues.  The though has been to hire a local lawyer, known to the local team, on a contract basis to help with these items.  There's significant work to help in dealing with pending construction and supply contracts as the concession winds down.  I assume this is OK with you.

				John,
				I met this lawyer that I mentioned to you again, and she seems to be
				ready to manage working for us full-time during a three months period in
				order to help us, mainly with the fixing of contractual issues with our
				suppliers vis a vis termination / tranfer of the contracts to the
				Province / determination of liabilities. The costs would not be high,
				and she seems to be (I hope so) a very discreet person (particularly
				considering the job she currently has). If you do not have a problem
				with this (my only concern is her work at the Municipality), I would ask
				her to start working for us on Monday, not on a labour relationship
				basis, but rather on a independent professional one (she would bill us
				for her services).

Dear Mr. Pincus:

	Thank you for your message and for sending your resume to me.  I have forwarded your information to Mr. Mark Haedicke, General Counsel of our Wholesale Group, and to Ms. Vicki Sharp, General Counsel of our Retail Group, for consideration in connection with any opportunities that may exist or come up.

	Please give my best to Les.

	Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Derrick:

     Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an in-house
counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's
unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy
Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close
in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of
Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may
occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other
career opportunities.

     I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of
my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel
for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the
energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating
gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related
documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including
physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I
am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the
energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy
industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers
Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for
representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility
regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate
mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues,
interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured
transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real
property matters.

     I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your
earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from
you soon.

     Thank you for your consideration.

                         Very truly yours,
                         Steven R. Pincus

Mark, S&S is a quality firm, but in my experience it tends to be very expensive (as are most of the New York firms).  I do not know whether it has offices in Washington State or Kentucky.  We have not in recent years used S&S to a significant degree.  What other firms have you considered? Jim

Jim,

we are evaluating 3 metals assets acquisition opportunities: 

1. the Longview alumina smelter in Washington State

2. the Vanalco alumina smelter in Washington State

3. an Arco/BP aluminum rolling facility in Kentucky.

I would like to run with one external US firm on these deals (the 3 deals are at exactly the same preliminary stage and there will be some economies of scale to be had. Also consistency of approach is important). The firm also needs to have strong offices with metals expertise both in London and New York and preferably close to the facilities in question. 

The firm I believe can deliver these advantages is Shearman and Sterling. I have spoken to a couple of people in the Houston office about this to get their views.

I would be grateful for your confirmation that you have no objection to this.

Thanks very much Jim.

Collen, congratulations on your new role! All the best.  Jim

One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organ=
ized in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our clie=
nts in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is t=
o modify our internal organization to better track the "functionalized" org=
anization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial ar=
eas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our res=
ources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce=
 that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediat=
ely.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Col=
leen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the "new business =
generation" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operatio=
ns group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sa=
le transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead re=
sponsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each =
of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they=
 assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the =
rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way a=
cquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Gr=
eg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory ac=
tivity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Mond=
ay, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, an=
d will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot a=
s he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will con=
tinue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus=
/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group=
, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexib=
le.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with pro=
jects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the =
challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy! =20

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in=
 welcoming Bill to the group on Monday! =20

Ken, Mark, and Greg:  a thoughtful piece regarding Dabhol by The Hindu.  Jim

An interesting article.  Could it happen?

Dabhol and the do nothing Government

By Prem Shankar Jha

Ever since the Vajpayee's Government came to power more than two
and a half years ago, the economy has been sliding relentlessly
into the deepest recession it has ever known. In the nine months
since December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. The
decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only five
years ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distant
memory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11
terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -
vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV
sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With no
demand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer price
index, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead and
there is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sector
is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human
memory.

In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to
find a place, however humble, in the organised sector of the
economy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risen
by another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confident
that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of
the country's problems.

But one recent event highlights the government's paralysis more
sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is its
failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the
Maharashtra State Electricity Boards's attempt to foil Enron's
bid to take it before an international arbitration court by
claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court
challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase
agreement.

The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government's
international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the
agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,
proceedings in an international court must take precedence over
those in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been cleared
for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an
international tribunal for a breach of it contractual
obligations.

Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron's lawyers, both those
whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase
agreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB
will lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservative
estimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs and
damages. In addition it will have to spend a little more to
complete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project is
likely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.
For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has
dragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was
simply a dispute between a State Government and a private
company, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in any
case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-
guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. But
today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because
neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,
let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the bill
will, inevitably land at the Centre's door. And that means the
taxpayer's door.

The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,
will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? The
answer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do is
transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete
and operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion power
plant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too will
insist on the capital value of the project being substantially
written down first. Judging from the offers that the Tata
Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply
Company (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value will
not exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, the
country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3
billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for that
matter anything else) in return.

None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron
probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao
government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor is
it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that
had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more
particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning
the latter's inability under law to pay backup charges at more
than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants
would have been exposed long ago.

But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify
even greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, the
Enron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As a
serious, responsible government that knows the importance of
honouring one's word in a world where contract is king, the
Vajpayee Government must honour the country's contractual
obligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying to
alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not
see, but by definition all future changes must be by mutual
consent.

The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol's power
affordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee
and the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buy
the $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a
separate company that can supply gas to all the current and
future users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one better
and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage
the plant. This is entirely feasible because its installed
capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. This
will bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges and
cost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.

Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the
equity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the
1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.
This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign
exchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicing
represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.

The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman
of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee
debt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity
tariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oil
having fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changes
will bring down the cost of Dabhol's power at 90 per cent
capacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will make
it entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and the
neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the
average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and
reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.

The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be
to take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it with
Enron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from it
at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before
handing it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court will
neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol's power nor answer
the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new
power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it
charges for electricity.

Dear Jim,
 
I spoke with Joyce Gillespie at The Lyons  Foundation who indicated the following are on their board: Jim Prentiss (Enron),  Judge Phil Peden, and R.A. Seale.  
 
We are asking this foundation for $5,000 support of   our education and outreach programs (deadline Nov. 1) and I'm  slipping in information regarding our Allison relief needs though not asking for  specific help at this point.  Since our records are still drying and  inaccessible, I've asked her to supply a summary of previous  support.
 
Do you know any of these trustees and could you  send a support note on our behalf?

Attached is a copy of our new release announcing the settlement of our
merger (sales?) case. Considering the regulatory environment here and the
good relations we have built with our state commission, we really do
believe we can get final state approval on November 28th!

I am going to unwind a bit and go fishing this weekend, but when I return
on Monday I'll start writing a new resume and begin focusing on my NEXT
career!  If  during your world wide  travels you hear of a challenging
opportunity that seems suitable, please do not hesitate to let me know.
All advice and suggestions  from friends are truly welcome!

Have a good weekend.

The following news release was issued at 2 a.m. EDT (7 a.m. BST).  You will
also be receiving a Merger Update on this announcement later this morning.

            Niagara Mohawk?National Grid Merger Joint Proposal
          Expected to Drop Residential Electricity Bills 5 percent

       New York State Department of Public Service Staff, IBEW Local 97,
      Business, Consumer, and Environmental Groups Support Agreement

     SYRACUSE and WESTBOROUGH, Oct. 12 ? Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s

residential customers are expected to see a 5 percent electricity bill

decrease under a proposed merger and rate plan settlement agreement

announced by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NYSE:NMK) and National Grid

Group plc (NYSE: NGG).  The agreement, reached with the New York State

Department of Public Service staff and other parties, was filed late

Thursday with the New York State Public Service Commission for approval.

If the merger closes, it would result in net customer savings of about $1

billion over the next 10 years, compared with rates projected without the

merger.  Also, as part of the agreement, the companies would expand Niagara

Mohawk's annual Upstate New York economic development efforts by $12.5

million.

     "Niagara Mohawk's merger with National Grid will allow us to reduce

and stabilize energy delivery costs and enhance our commitment to economic

development in the communities we serve," said William F. Edwards, Niagara

Mohawk's senior vice president and chief financial officer.  "We believe

this agreement will provide significant benefits to Upstate customers and

to the economy."

     "The rate cuts, low-income protection, and other benefits agreed to in

this plan will help National Grid fulfill our commitment to become a

positive presence in Upstate New York," said Lawrence Reilly, senior vice

president and general counsel for National Grid USA.

     "The significant size of the merged companies will provide us with the

resources and skills necessary to deliver first-rate customer service while

being a low-cost provider of electricity and natural gas service," he said.

He added that the agreement details a comprehensive service quality plan

under which customer safety, reliability, and service will be maintained

and enhanced after the merger.  The plan calls for up to $24 million in

annual penalties ? or more under certain conditions ? if defined customer

service and reliability goals aren't achieved.

     Niagara Mohawk's actual costs for delivery of electricity are expected

to drop by more than 8 percent through the merger.  When those savings are

applied to a customer's entire electricity bill ? which also includes the

cost of electricity purchased ? the net savings are projected to equal 5

percent.

     The reduction would be implemented upon consummation of the merger.

At that time, today's agreement calls for customers' delivery charges to be

immediately reduced by approximately $160 million.  After that decrease,

delivery charges would remain stabilized for

10 years subject to limited adjustments.  In addition, the companies would

forgo collection of approximately $850 million in nuclear costs that

otherwise would have been collected from customers.

     The long-term proposal has a number of other initiatives, including:

?    Price-stabilized electricity commodity service for residential and
small commercial customers for several years, providing those customers
with significant protection from any major fluctuations in the generation
marketplace.
?    The extension by 16 months of a multi-year gas rate settlement,
resulting in gas delivery rates -- unchanged since 1996 -- remaining the
same through December 2004.
?    The extension of the Low-Income Customer Assistance Program, which was
expanded under Niagara Mohawk's existing regulatory agreement with the PSC,
and the development of a special rate for eligible low-income customers.
?    The establishment of electricity choice educational programs targeted
to customers and energy service companies.
?    Environmental benefits such as interconnection assistance for wind
power sources, support for "green" power marketing, and the continued sale
of surplus land for preservation.
     The agreement culminates five months of negotiations among Niagara

Mohawk, National Grid, the Department of Public Service staff, and other

parties including large industrial customers,

energy service companies, and various state agencies.

      "This joint proposal continues the recent downward trend in Niagara

Mohawk's delivery rates for businesses and provides additional rate and

service options for those customers, all of which should enhance business

expansion and economic development across Upstate New York," said Robert

Loughney on behalf of Multiple Intervenors, a trade association

representing the interests of the state's largest commercial and industrial

employers.

     The proposed settlement is supported by two major national

environmental groups: the Natural Resources Defense Council, and

Environmental Defense.  It also is supported by the American Wind Energy

Association and by Community Energy, a green power marketing company.

     "The merger agreement benefits the environment and the economy, by

providing customers with an easy way to purchase renewable energy products

on their electricity bill, and by stimulating a large new investment in

wind energy generation in Upstate New York," said David Wooley, counsel for

the four environmental interests.  "In this proposal, National Grid

demonstrates that it intends to continue Niagara Mohawk's established

record of responsible environmental stewardship."

     A leading advocacy group for low-income customers also supports the

joint settlement proposal.

     "Specifically and positively addressed in this proposal are the needs

of many customers who struggle to make ends meet," said Ben Wiles, an

attorney for the Public Utility Law Project.  "The opportunity created by

the merger of National Grid USA and Niagara Mohawk will result in a special

reduced rate for as many as 60,000 eligible low-income customers.  It also

will expand Niagara Mohawk's safety net program to allow more people to

receive assistance."

     Among the other parties to sign the settlement was the International

Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 97, which represents Niagara

Mohawk's unionized work force.  In addition, the Distributed Generation

Power Coalition, energy marketers, energy services companies, and regional

economic development agencies support the settlement proposal.

     The companies have asked that the matter be considered at the PSC's

Nov. 28 meeting.  The merger also is subject to Securities and Exchange

Commission approval.

     Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. is an investor-owned energy services

company that provides electricity to more than 1.5 million customers across

24,000 square miles of Upstate New York.  The company also delivers natural

gas to more than 540,000 customers over 4,500 square miles of eastern,

central, and northern New York.

     National Grid USA includes local electric companies Massachusetts

Electric, Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric, Nantucket

Electric, and a substantial transmission business.  Its parent company,

National Grid Group plc, builds, owns, and operates electric and

telecommunications networks around the world.

I just spoke to John Sutton, who was calling from his home in Austin.

He asked that I inform you that he regrets that he will be unable to
attend the Jurisprudence Luncheon.  He was very much looking forward to
it, and visiting with you.  Unfortunately he just brought his wife home
from the hospital, where she had been treated for pneumonia, and needs to

Jeff, please see the attachment.  I may, of course, alter it a bit over the weekend.  Jim

 

I am attaching a draft of the program timeline.  Please look it over and
give me any feedback you have.

If you have written your remarks, and could forward them to me I would
appreciate it.  If the time listed for each of you, is insufficient, or
longer than you would like, please let me know.

I think the most important thing regarding the program is to start as
close to 12:00 noon as possible, and to end as close to 1:15 p.m. as
possible, while giving everyone ample opportunity to enjoy their meal,
socialize, and to recognize both of you.

Have a great weekend.

	Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

	The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Joel, I am ok with this. Jim

Hi Jim. We are starting to work on a second receivables transaction [involving financial receivables in a terms structure as opposed to physical gas receivables in a conduit deal]. I recommend that V&E represent us, and that Sidley& Austin represent Deutsche Bank on this deal -- there are some economies from using the same firms that just closed the receivables deal last quarter.

Andy Edison has notified me that Jones, Day is representing a party in a litigation matter adverse to Enron. Please notify me if you are aware of any work that Jones, Day is performing for any Enron entity or for any lender or underwriter on an Enron matter.  Thank you. Jim

Mark, I will support yours and Bruce's decision.  Jim

Jim,

CC have asked for permission to act for a potential purchaser of our JV company in Korea. This falls within EGAS and Bruce Lundstrom has given the all clear. CC are of course aware of the consequences of acting adversely to Enron in litigation. 

Unless you object, I will confirm that CC can proceed. 

Thanks

Mark -

SK Enron is part of EGAS.

It is my understanding that there were more than 15 expressions of interest in acquiring our interest in SK Enron.  Accordingly, there will be a number of firms that will be representing potential buyers.  I don't think that we have a problem with Clifford Chance representing a potential buyer.  We have not used CC in connection with this investment.

Bill, I've never heard CC's name come up in connection with SK Enron (e.g., representing a seller in SK Enron's purchase of a smaller LDC) but would appreciate your confirmation as well.

Thanks,
Bruce

Gents,

I am trying to discover who has legal or commercial responsibility for SK Enron Korea. I personally have no difficulty with Clifford Chance acting on this disposal on the other side of the table from Enron, but have no knowledge of which law firms other divisions use in this area. 

I'd be grateful for feedback as a matter of urgency. 

Thanks

Dear Mark,

I refer to my below email and our telephone conversation of last week. You
wanted to find out the person responsible for this project within Enron and
you were absolutely correct with your comment that this is, as usual, a very
urgent matter. Please be informed that in the meantime my partners in Asia
contacted the CFO of Enron in Asia, Jeremy Thirsk, who does not envisage
that there will be a conflict. Jeremy promised to confirm the position once
he has spoken to you or to Bruce Lunstrom. I hope that this has happened in
the meantime. Could you, please, give us your final ok as soon as possible?

Thank you very much.
Kind regards,
Johannes Perlitt

Thank you for the message.  I am currently scheduled to be in meetings on the East Coast on October 11 and thus will not be able to attend the Houston meeting. Jim Derrick

Dear James:

I wanted to draw your attention to our upcoming dinner discussion on
America's Foreign Policy Tradition and the War on Terrorism.  Walter
Russell Mead, Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on
Foreign Relations, will lead the discussion and Norman B. Frankel,
Physician at the Medical Clinic of Houston, will chair and host.  The
dinner will take place on Thursday, October 11, from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m. at
the River Oaks Country Club, located on 1600 River Oaks Boulevard.

In light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration is
faced with the unique challenge of building a national consensus for what
could be the longest, most complex, and most difficult war in American
history.  Walter Russell Mead will discuss how America's foreign policy
tradition, defense culture, and diplomatic history will influence President
Bush and America in responding to the terrorist threat.  Walter has just
completed a study of the history of U.S. foreign policy at the Council on
Foreign Relations and written a book, Special Providence, due to be
published by Knopf in November.

Please let me know if you plan to participate.

Regards,
Irina

Paula, thank you for the update.  I have seen the V&E portion and am pleased with it.  I will see you tomorrow morning.  Jim

Jim - The presentation from GS and V&E was still preliminary on Friday, and Andy had also not yet seen the proposed presentation.  As such, I did not review it with Ken.  (Plus, the Agenda Review was fairly long.)  Andy set up a review session with GS and V&E for 8:30 Monday morning - let's look at it then and decide how best to brief Ken, or if we feel it is still necessary to do so based on your and Andy's previous communications with Ken.   

FYI,  GS and V&E have prepared a 20 minute joint presentation, but it will likely take longer with Q&A.  GS will present a merger market overview, a discussion of vulnerability and a discussion of defenses.  V&E willl address defenses in place as well as other possible defenses.   

Attending the Exec. Session on Tuesday morning are:
V&E	Joe Dilg
	Harry Reasoner
	Scott Wulfe
GS	Andy arranging [to come]

'See you on Monday.  Paula

Michael, I am currently scheduled to be in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday and Thursday, returning to Houston Thursday night.  If my schedule changes so that I can be at your event, I certainly shall.  I admire the way in which you are running your campaign.  All the best.  Jim

         Jim,
 
         As  a reminder, our big luncheon fundraiser will be next Thursday.  Thanks for  agreeing to  
         be  on the host team.  I can tell you it opened  doors for me!
 
         I have attached an invitation.  I hope you can  make it.  We're having a host table, and I  
         hope  you can be there.  Please let me know.   I know Enron legal is having a meeting (in  
        the  Woodlands?) that day, but if you could stop by it would be  great. 
Thanks for your  support.

Mona, I am ok with your continuing to work with Steve Bowen. Jim

Jim,

I work in Government Affairs, supporting EBS.  I have been working with Steve Bowen of Blumenfeld & Cohen on issues in California relative to EBS as well as negotiating interconnection agreements with SBC.  Jeff Dasovich and Scott Bolton worked with Blumenfeld & Cohen prior to my entry into EBS issues.

Because Steve Bowen has recently broken away from B&C to form his own law firm, I was wondering if I need to get approval to work w/ Steve in this arrangement.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Mona

we are trying to tie up loose ends with Blumenfeld & Cohen, and they
have
asked for written verification for clients that have switched their
legal
matters to Bowen Law Group.  I've attached a short letter for that
purpose.  If
you are comfortable with the wording, please put the letter on MFN
letterhead,
sign and fax a copy to us (415-394-7500) and mail the original to the DC
office
at the address on the letter.  I'd greatly appreciate it if you could
fax the
letter to us today if possible.

Thanks much.  Anita.

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Dear Colleagues:

Further to our email of September 21, we have received feedback from
companies interested in completing the Consultation Document for the Busine=
ss
Principles for Countering Bribery, but were concerned that the deadline had
past.

We have contacted the Steering Committee and received an extension to
accommodate your feedback.  The Consultation Document may be submitted to

RW, which London QC would represent us?  JVD
 Jim Derrick

Folks -

We had a lawyer conference call today to discuss the prospect of filing a
suit in London Commercial Court to enjoin the GOM from trying to file a
suit in India to void the GOM Guarantee and State Support Agreements.

Chris Walker, local counsel, GE and Bechtel support filing the suit.  Other
than Jim McCartney, the Enron representatives support filing the suit.  In
the end, Jim McCartney defers to Chris Walker's judgment.

Filing suit in London has some risks.  We are uncertain of the response of
the India Supreme Court, the GOM and the current GOM/DPC arbitration panel.
The Supreme Court may take offense to the filing (although Chris thinks
that this risk is small).  In a perverse way, our filing in London could
further induce GOM to file in India (although we believe that they will in
any event).  The current arbitration panel may use this as an opportunity
to wait until the underlying DPC/MSEB dispute is decided (although Chris
doubts it).

My understanding is that Enron commercial supports the filing of the suit.
It is scheduled to be filed on Friday. If any of you would like to revisit
the issue before Friday, please let me know.

Bruce

S, apparently my message to Tom Bres did not go through. Please forward your copy to him.  Thank you.

Hardie, James we have been reviewing Corporate Legal allocations to EEL.  As EEL covers the below services in house we do not anticipate any charges from corp for 2002.  Could you please remove the allocations to EEL.    If you have any questions please get back to either myself or Baldip Dosanjh on x35589.

FYI

To my friends and colleagues:=20
        After 27+ years with Houston Pipe Line Company (under the successiv=
e ownership of HNG, InterNorth, Enron, and now AEP), I've decided to try so=
mething different.  As of September 30, I will no longer be getting up and =
driving downtown to work every day.  Much has happened in 2001, on personal=
, family, professional, national, and global levels, which has induced me t=
o act on my inclination to retire (I've been thinking about it ever since I=
 got that solicitation from AARP).  There is much that I will miss (daily c=
amaraderie with co-workers and colleagues, challenging work, interesting pr=
ojects, a paycheck), but there are other things that I can do without (rush=
 hour traffic, cumbersome regulations, long hours, irreconcilable conflicts=
, office politics, tedious paperwork, seemingly endless meetings, payroll d=
eductions).  On balance, it looks like a fair trade.=20
        I have enjoyed the very good fortune of having a challenging and sa=
tisfying career, and of having been able to do so in the company of many wo=
nderful people.  I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for your=
 friendship and support over the years, for contributing to my never-ending=
 education, and for being a valued part of my experiences and memories.  Th=
ere have been a lot of good times, and some less good times, but I wouldn't=
 want to start all over again and see how it turns out next time around.  I=
 am enormously grateful for all of my many blessings, and hopefully the sam=
e is true for you.  =20
        My general plan for right now is to contemplate the future and my p=
lace in it, which sound pretty good to me -- both the process of contemplat=
ion as well as the future itself.  I do intend to find some arguably produc=
tive and/or fun ways to spend my new otherwise idle time, and finding out w=
hat those may be should be half the fun.  Perhaps the biggest concern is ho=
w long Linda will be able to tolerate my not getting up and leaving the hou=
se every weekday morning, but she's at the church a lot of the time anyway.=
  I'm sure the boys are wondering how my being around the house more will a=
ffect their tranquility and privacy, and that remains to be seen, although =
I doubt that I'll be hanging out with them and their friends very much anyw=
ay.=20
        One of my specific resolutions as we go forward is to do a better j=
ob of keeping up with friends.  The wonders of e-mail will facilitate that =
endeavor, but I will also be available in person for lunches, happy hours, =
tee times, dinners, movies, and other consultations. I already know where t=
o find you; reciprocally, my contact information will now be tsheltont@aol.=
com; 3507 Plumb, Houston, TX 77005; phone 713-665-5315; and fax 713-665-741=
0.  As time goes on, I may self-indulgently send e-mail updates; if you con=
sider them "spam," you know where the "Delete" button is.=20
        Linda and I will be out of town on a trip to New England next week,=
 but when we return I will commence a substantially different way of life. =
 I am eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold.  Like most people,=
 I'm anxious to spend more time with my family (they may be a little anxiou=
s about that, too).  Myriads of exciting new opportunities and challenges u=
ndoubtedly await, and I'm looking forward to discovering and pursuing many =
of them.  The list of things I want or need to do is already quite long, an=
d will likely grow even faster than I can check things off the list.=20
        As for the very immediate future, I'm going to click on "Send," pic=
k up my briefcase, and head for the elevator.  We have to get ready to go t=
o Brian's volleyball tournament in Dallas tomorrow.  So long for now, best =
wishes, and see ya around.

Scotty, it's an honor to count you as one of my closest friends. Thank you for your support.  All the best.  Jim

Jim,

Well, you finally gave a speech that topped the one you gave at Linda's and my rehearsal dinner.  You did an outstanding job (as did Carrin), and it was obvious you were speaking from the heart.  I know you would prefer not to have all of this attention, but it comes with the territory.  It sure made me proud to see you up there, and congratulations on the accomplishment.

Scotty

Charles, I am saddened to learn that Linklaters' policy requires that your term as senior partner must soon come to an end.  I trust, however, that you will continue to be active at Linklaters, and I look forward to continuing our working relationship and friendship.  With respect to the proposed visit by Anthony Cann on Monday, I regret that I will be on the east coast on that day.  I do look forward to meeting him, either in Houston or on one of my trips to London.  All the best to you and Linklaters. Jim 

My 5 year term as senior partner of Linklaters is very nearly up. Throughout
that term it has given me great pleasure to see our relationship with Enron
steadily strengthen - with a remarkable coverage across our offices.

I have much enjoyed our meetings, and particularly visiting you in Houston
with Stuart Salt, a little time ago.  I very much hope my successor, Anthony
Cann, can similarly get to know you.

It transpires that Anthony will be in Houston next Monday, and I wondered if
you would have a slot (I know this is short notice) to meet Anthony on
Monday.  I have asked Stuart to liaise with you to see if this can be
progressed.

In the meantime, can I send you and your fine company my very best wishes
for the future.

Re:       October Meeting at Silverado Country Club & Resort

Charles Morgan and I would like your opinion about whether the Committee
should postpone or cancel our Fall meeting at Silverado due to the recent
tragic events in New York and Washington, DC.  The Executive Committee has
put together a great program and set of events, but we understand that
people may want to change their travel plans in response to recent events.

Hi there, following up from my call earlier...

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards

Tracy, as Stephanie mentioned in her e-mail to you, all of next Tuesday morning through early afternoon is consumed by the Enron Board of Directors meeting and by the Annual Shareholders meeting.

Tracy, Mr. Derrick will be involved in the Enron Board of Directors meeting that Tuesday morning.  Number one, we try to keep the schedule light on Tuesday's and Thursday's; and number two, because of the BOD, I am hesitant to schedule in light of possible time constraints.  I will ask Mr. Derrick if I may make the appointment and get back to you.  

Thanks

Hi Stephanie,

Mark Evans is in Houston for the conference next week and will be in the Houston office prior to the conference.  He would like to have a meeting with Mr Derrick whilst in the Houston office for, say, 1/2 hour, could you please let me know what time would be most convenient for Mr Derrick on Tuesday,  1 May.

Many thanks

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.
 
I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

Further to our conversation of 5am today Sydney time, I am today formally resigning as a Director of Enron Coal Asia Pacific Pty Ltd (ECAP). As I have been discussing with Stu for the past few weeks, in the current environment it has been increasingly difficult for me to carry out my duties as a Director without an ongoing commercial knowledge of the operation. Further to this, with the accounting now being done from London, I have no day to day contact with ECAP's financial position and this further complicates my position. 

In light of this concern I advised Stu a few weeks ago that it would be preferable to have one of the resident commercial staff take over this role and I believe this would now be the appropriate action for ECAP to take. My resignation will leave ECAP with no resident Director as is required under Aust Corporations law. (As promised I will have our trading lawyer, Robert McGrory, send you an email today outlining the implications of this breech). While this will cause a deterioration in the position of ECAP, I feel I have no option but to take this action given the current position of Enron and our alternate views on the implications of these for ECAP. I have previously indicated to Stu that this is a matter that would need to be addressed and the lack of resolution is not sufficient reason for me to retain the role. 

The action of Dynergy in terminating the proposed merger today would indicate that a review of the ability of ECAP to meet all current debts should be undertaken and had I remained as a Director I would have been recommending that a Board meeting be called to address this matter and potentially appoint an administrator if required. This action has been conducted for every other company in Sydney, hence similar consideration by ECAP Directors must be an immediate priority. Unless the Directors can satisfied yourselves that all debts will be met as and when they fall due an Administrator must be appointed to avoid personal liability and potential criminal liability. An new debts subsequently incurred included ongoing rent, travel and operating costs will be come personal liabilities of the Directors.

Jo Jo, Jan, Bob, Holly, Tanner, Vicki, Laura, Bud, and Carrin's Mother and Father were in attendance, as well as several hundred others, including many of the judges.  I thought you might be interested in the text of my response.  Love, Dad

	We are close to making a decision on whether to use F&J or some other firm for a new Mariner matter.  I anticipate that if we retain some other firm besides F&J, F&J may want to give us our files back, per the original Gus Blackshear letter to Jim.  Of course, F&J will insist in giving back one of Mark's files under any circumstance.  Put aside for a moment the problematic ethical issue that I believe that raises for F&J and whether we would pursue F&J for taking such an action. If F&J sends our files back, can we live with that in the cases/matters you are handling?  

	For Mark, Jordan and Theresa, I of course already have Theresa's voice-mail regarding the new Mariner matter, and have (along with Jim) spoken with Scott Josie.  I also have an urgent call in for Kelly Zelacovitz.

	If there is anyone else you think I should include in this e-mail, please let me know.

	Please reply ASAP.

My suggestion -- Have Mariner go forward with F&J; advise firm that we are working on a response to conflicts waiver, but expect to arrive at a resolution that is mutually acceptable to both firm and Enron; this, in turn, may help our negotiations.

	This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago.  I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.

	I see two options:

	1.  If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.

	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.

	Caveat:  I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.  

	I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.

	If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.

	I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do.

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice.

I know that it is impossible to get you on the phone. I have left a couple of messages. I just thought I would let you know how much I feel for you and all of the good Enron folks. You all are in our thoughts and prayers. It does not seem possible that Houston's flagship company and premier corporate citizen could get struck by lightning. If it happens to you all, it could happen to anybody. I have been following the situation daily because I have been representing Tyco in a revision of their existing contract with EESO. It has not been pretty.

As you know, I have twice volunteered our firm's assistance to Enron in anyway we could be of help. I took the lack of response to mean you had all the help you needed. We have been approached by a couple of clients to advise them and to represent them if there appears no solution to Enron's problems short of protection of the bankruptcy court. Do you have an objection to our representation of them? I will assume that you have none if I do not hear from you to the contrary.

Jez: email is fine.  If you prefer to use the fax, the number is 713-853-3920. Jim

I believe that the Resolutions No. 4, 6 and 9 are not correct in terms of the text:

1. resolution no. 4 is not correct since the S.Board did not review the new (attached) changes to the budget and did not approve it. There was also an amandement to the text of the Resolution re. the line items and the total amounts exeeding the approved budget.	

I believe that the draft Budget with the new amendemends must be reviewed once again as a whole at the next Sup.Board meeting before it can be enacted.

2. Resoltuions No. 6 and 9 - the vote descritpion is not correct

We do not provide copies of the policies.  

The Corporate indemnity is the first line of defense for the D's &O's.  If the indemnity responds, the company seeks reimbursement from the policy up to its limit.   There is no other D&O insurance above the $350,000,000, amount of insurance.

regarding information pertaining to the various lawsuits because nothing pertained specifically to me or anyone in my present group.  However, my neighbor who was an enron employee and then a contract employee told me last week that he was contacted by an outside person seeking infomation.  My neighbor developed the model or package that performed calculations on the Chewco partnership.  I asked him if he had told anyone at Enron that he was approached by an outside party and since he was no longer employed there he didn't get the email and had not.  If you would be so kind to tell me who he should contact, he will.  He told me that Enron had been very good to him and he had no intention of discussing this with anyone outside the immediate company.  As an FYI to you, I believe he mentioned that he still had this program on his home computer.

The following limited liability companies are being considered for dissolution this week. Please let me know by 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December 12, 2001 if there is any reason not to dissolve these limited liability companies.  If I receive no responses, we will proceed with the cancellations.

Bob, this is a duplicate of the message I forwarded to you last night. Jim

Dear Jim: I received a subpoena in TODAY's US Mail in Fred Greenberg v. various Enron Directors. I was directed to appear and bring various documents at the offices of Esquire Deposition Services, Houston, Texas on November 23, 2001.  It indicated that I was subpoenaed on a representative of ES Power 3 LLC. 
I officially retired from Enron on April 1, 2001. I have no understanding that I had any direct relationship with ES Power 3 LLC. I retained no records of the company and have no idea why I am being subpoenaed. 
Would you kindly advise me in a timely manner if I have any obligation to respond?  
The subpoena was mailed to me care of Enron in Houston and apparently forwarded to me in an envelope which arrived TODAY. 
Kindly advise me how I am expected to proceed.

I understand that due to Enron's problems in America and the fact that that Arthur Andersen are getting involved in a dispute over various audit matters as a result of the bankruptcy there may be difficulties in having Andersen audit ENS for year 2001. While I can see that there may be reservations in accepting the re-appointment of Andersen for ENS I feel that we should consider the implications of finding another auditor at this late stage.

Andersen in Warsaw are well aware of the problems ENS is facing at the present time with regard to power and gas pricing; they are aware of the problems associated with the Settlement Agreement and it's accounting treatment to date. They are familiar with our systems and people. We have also negotiated a significant reduction in fees compared with last year.

New auditors would have to be taken through all the issues from scratch. This would consume time not only from the accounting department but throughout the Company. The audit would take longer and, at this stage, I'm not sure when any new auditors would be able to start given that January is their busiest period. Andersen are available with immediate effect since I have constantly been impressing on them that, given the complexity of ENS problems, we should allow ourselves the maximum amount of time to consider what to put into the report should some problems persist longer than envisaged.

I feel that a change in auditors at this moment in time would be not be in our best interests in view of the above. Also if the ownership of ENS is to be changed it would be beneficial to have audited accounts in double quick time since potential investors will undoubtedly be looking for such statements. 

Gail, thank you for your fine work on this, and congratulations on the great result! Jim

	As an aside, from a litigation perspective, A&K did a very good job.  They were responsive in filing the arbitration demand and did a great job applying for and obtaining an injunction against a proposed sale of some of the IHI assets which, in turn, facilitated IHI's coming to the table to negotiate a possible resolution of the matter. 

the arbitration proceeding filed with respect to this ena investment (which andrews and kurth filed for us), has been settled quickly in our favor with gail's assistance. this is the matter which we felt would not get actually litigated in the context of selection of counsel and wanted to confirm back this was the case.

Dear Kate,

We (the four employees as mentioned below; "The Party's") have a labour contract with Enron Netherlands B.V. an entity of which Insinger de Beaufort / Equity Trust Co. N.V. is formally in charge. At this moment The Party's are still employed by and working for Enron in the Netherlands. Until now it looks like though The Party's will not receive the monthly payment for December 2001 that will be due on the 20th of this month (as per the respective labour contracts). Untill this month the actual payment came from the UK but it is very unlikely that this will be the case in December and onwards.

Furthermore we know that Enron Netherlands B.V. has sufficient funds in 3 different bankaccounts (in cash and collateral) and will therefore not be able to go bankrupt at this moment in time.

As Equity Trust Co. N.V. is formally in charge of this particular entity they are able (and even obliged) to do the monthly payment but they will only facilitate this as soon as they have received sufficient instructions. The instruction should not only instruct them to do the monthly payment as such but also explicitly tell them to use the available cash and/or collateral for that. For your information: the collateral I am talking about is currently still in the hands of the Dutch Transmission System Operator ('Tennet') as a kind of guarantee for the trading we used to do but no longer (can) do.

Please note as a practicality that the necessary administrative handling regarding the monthly payments (calculating nett amounts etc.) is done by PriceWaterhouseCoopers in Rotterdam. For details regarding the specific and individual monthly payment obligations of Enron Netherlands B.V. towards The Party's Equity Trust can contact mrs. Kenny Toekimin or mrs. Helene van Bommel at PWC on telephone number +31 10 400 8600.

If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to contact me in the Enron Amsterdam office on +31 20 654 1957 or on +31 10 5916168 or alternatively per e-mail.

Please see the message below from Mary Nell. I do believe that it is very important to keep this team working on the project. Thank you for your consideration of the request. 

Jim,   as I mentioned to you earlier we are forging ahead with the Enron Corp. interests project in Europe.  We commenced our work based on discussions with Jim Fallon, Ray Bowen and others about a week ago and plan to pay the employees with funds currently held by EEFT.  I expect to receive tomorrow a formalized structure for the teams, again organized around EEFT.  As I understand it, however, this proposal will not address any retention bonuses for the teams because this issue is still under discussion.  I have been told that there is hesitancy on the part of some in Houston to provide for such payments but I do not know the reason for that hesitancy.  

May I suggest that it would be entirely appropriate to provide for retention payments in this case.  As I have mentioned, part of this project is to recover value from existing contracts in entities such as ECTRIC, which value is estimated in the aggregate to be $150 to 200 million.  Another aspect of the Corp. interest project is to properly wind up entities so as to recover value and minimize director liabilities.  A proposal was made that a percentage of the recovered value would be put into a bonus pool and shared among all of the team members, whether those individuals had focused on recovery of funds or minimizing liabilities.  I am told that this proposal was rejected in a conference call held today.

I am very concerned about our ability to keep people working on this project without some additional incentive.  The project is extremely difficult and many people, in particular the traders who are in a position to protect value in ECTRIC, have other job options.  In addition, the employees on the team are aware that many individuals who are working on PWC teams are receiving retention payments.  If the team to protect the ECTRIC interests is not retained in the short term, ECTRIC is scheduled to be put into administration on January 4, resulting in termination of many of its in-the-money contracts and a loss of an estimated 50% of its value. 

Jim, if you are inclined to support retention payments to help us maintain this effort going forward, will you please communicate that fact to Jim Fallon, Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen tomorrow, as it is likely we will begin to lose people after Christmas.  Thank you. 

Alan, per my voice mail to you. Thank you. Jim
Dear Sir:

My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors
of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local
manager of this company.  I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with
Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited
indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims.

PLEASE READ ON.

I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from
1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East.  During
this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and
approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000.  I have duly filed and had
approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the
reimbursement yet.  Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with
Enron (clay.harris@enron.com, EGM LNG team, London).  Ms. Kim Hickok
(kim.hickok@enron.com) is the current EGM HR person and has the full
documentation relating to the claim.

PLEASE READ ON.

Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets.  I plead with
you to instruct Mr. Donegan to sell Enron Middle East's assets reimburse my
pre-agreed, appropriately lodged, and duly approved expense claims, whose
non-payment has been ruinous for my family.

I thank you for your help at these difficult times.

The proposed location of the 2002 Institute is fine by me.  The suggested date of the mid-year meeting is shown as Friday, August 28.  I believe that August 28 falls on Tuesday.  Jim

TO:                Executive Committee of the Advisory Board
                     of the International Oil and Gas educational  Center
 
FROM:          Pat Martin, Chair
 
RE:             Mid-Year  Meeting and 2002 Oil & Gas Law Institute   
 
I would appreciate your prompt response  to the two questions presented below, regarding (1) the date of our mid-year  meeting and (2) the location of our 2002 Institute. 
At our annual meeting in San Antonio,  and pursuant to our long range plan for the center, we determined to institute  an annual mid-year meeting of the Executive Committee. An agenda will be  provided to you beforehand, but among the items for review will be our long  range plan to expand the scope of the center and recommendations from our  several new subcommittees: Programs (Chair John Lowe), Membership (Chair Jim  Armour), New Center Name (Chair Pat Martin) and Website and  Technology.
Absent a groundswell of opposition from  you, I intend to schedule this meeting for Friday, August 28, 2001 in Dallas.  Please let me know right away if this date is impossible for you.
I am happy to report that our 2002  Institute Co-Chairs, Brad Keithley of Jones Day in Dallas and Jack Lynch of BP  in Houston, will be joining us at the meeting as ex officio members of the  Executive Committee. 
Finally, attached are the results  of our poll of the 2001 Institute attendees and of our Advisory Board concerning  the preferred location for our 2002 Institute next February. It appears that all  roads lead to Houston this year. With the results of the San  Antonio program and a Houston program in hand, we will be in a better  position to determine the best home(s) for the Institute in the  future. Please let us know if Houston meets  your approval.
I appreciate your leadership at  this important time in the evolution of the center.

FYI

	In September I sent you all a summary of the facts at issue in the above-referenced lawsuit. Since that time, several developments have occurred.  First, the trial date was moved from October 11, 2001 to November 13, 2001.  We have no reason to believe that we will not go to trial on the 13th.  We expect the trial to last from 10 days to 2 weeks. Judge Ira Gammerman will try the case. There is no jury. 
	The second development deals with the proposed summary judgment motions mentioned in my last e-mail.  Summary judgments on liability and damages have been filed and the plaintiffs have responded.  We have filed replies to their opposition papers.  In addition, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability.  We filed opposition papers to this motion.  New York practice differs somewhat from Texas practice to the extent that we have no firm date for a hearing on these motions.  Although we are attempting to get a hearing before the trial date, the judge has complete discretion as to whether to hear the parties' motions for summary judgment before the start of trial.
	The third development relates to the plaintiffs' theory of the case. It seems clear from the papers filed in response to our motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs are fine-tuning their case to focus on the contracts' size distribution requirement arguing that the type of coal supplied by Enron, whether crushed or not, could never meet the contracts' size distribution requirement. The plaintiffs make this argument in simple terms and, when argued as such, it has some appeal. However, it is Enron's position that the contracts' language is ambiguous and the better (and much more complicated) approach advanced by the defendants is that the subject coal could and would have met the size distribution requirements. Issues of whether the contracts are installment contracts also play heavily in this analysis. 
	Fourth, since the last e-mail on this matter, we have learned that the plaintiffs are seeking $71 million in damages from Enron. This is approximately half of the amount of the contracts' damage cap. 
	Lastly, we finally received a response from the plaintiffs to the settlement proposal we made in June. The plaintiffs have offered to resolve this matter for a cash payment by Enron of $45 million. In the alternative, the plaintiffs have proposed a business alternative which is currently being investigated. Additionally, there is some discussion of mediation in the limited time remaining before trial.
	Should you have any questions about this case or should you need any further information, please call me.

Eric, thank you.  Jim

To the first descriptive paragraph we should add "manufacture and sale of wind turbine electric generation equipment; ownership and operation (for ourselves and others) of wind turbine electric generation facilities".   Also in the third and last descriptive paragraphs we should consider substituting "wind energy" where it states "solar energy", unless another group is engaged in any solar energy related activities.  If so, we should add wind energy to the construction and development  and information dissemination sections of the recitation.  I believe with these changes our activities would be fairly disclosed.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Please proceed.

Jim, as we discussed late last night I checked with all folks in the DC office who would have any conceivable reason to talk to Treasury.

Good morning, gentlemen.  Mutual colleagues in the energy industry have suggested that I contact you directly about joining the Enron organization in a senior legal or business capacity.

I relocated from San Francisco to Tulsa in 1996 when I was recruited to join MAPCO in a General Counsel's position.  A year later, MAPCO was acquired by Williams, where I have served as one of four Associate General Counsel.  I have now learned that in a merger (even one billed as a merger of equals), it is preferable to be on the buyer's side rather than to be included among those who have been acquired!!!  Thus, I am seeking new opportunities at the Deputy/Associate General Counsel level.

Williams and Enron share many of the same businesses, operations and values.  The experience gained at MAPCO/Williams, coupled with general leadership and management skills, is easily portable to another energy company. Moreover, the Company's current difficulties may create the need for a senior lawyer with substantial litigation, government investigation and policy advocacy experience.

I get to Houston often and would very much like to meet with you even if only for an exploratory discussion. My CV is attached; also, I will send to you, under separate cover, a profile which was published in Diversity & the Bar magazibe, the quarterly insert to Corporate Counsel Monthly.

My office telephone number is 918-523-3354; I look forward to meeting with you  shortly.  Thank you for your consideration.

Very sincerely,

I met with Robert Taylor this week at your residence and had a very productive meeting.  One question that came up was the use of security cameras.  Areas that we discussed using cameras were:

Gate at Larchmont
Driveway gate

Please let me know if that is something that you are interested in or would like to discuss.

thanks Alan

Brad A. Kirchhofer

Bill, thank you for your support of the ADL event, and congratulations on the succesful completion of  your MS ride!  All the best.  Jim 

Jeff--nice to see you at the bike ride on Saturday, and to meet you at the
luncheon Monday honoring Jim Derrick. Thought you might be interested in the
report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection with the bike
ride over the weekend.

Several persons who have either pledged, or are considering a pledge, to the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails asking
if I am still alive after the MS150 charity bike ride held this past
weekend. Others have asked for a report of my experience. I am alive and
sore. If you are not interested in the report, please delete this email.

First of all, for those who have pledged or already sent you checks payable
to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society,  thanks is an inadequate word.
Remember that you are helping colleagues and others, and perhaps yourself
with your contributions.

This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story unlike anything I ever
expected.

Here is my story, if you are interested:

BASIC FACTS:

1.  I did show up for the bike ride (5:30 am Saturday).

2.  I did start the bike ride (7:10 am) with approximately 9400 bikers in
the largest charity bike ride in the country.

3.  I did ride my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day,
some 199 miles down the road..

4.  I did either ride my bike, or push it up several hills, for approx. 182
miles of the 199 mile route.

5.  I crossed the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the
deadline of 6:00 pm on Sunday.

6.  I ended up meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the trip.
That resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of the
pack of 9400 bike riders, and was passed by nearly all of them before I
reached Austin.

7.  I am extremely pleased to have participated in the event.  I don't have
the time to participate in such events very often, and I was fortunate to
have a schedule which opened up just in time for me to enter this event.

RANDOM GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:

1.  The charity event title, "MS150", is a misnomer.  When I signed up for
this event, I understood the "150" part of the event title to refer to the
mileage between Houston and Austin. I was wrong.  The "150" I now understand
to mean the approximate number of blisters to be found on one's posterior
when a biker crosses the finish line.

2.  I have driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past.  There are
routes between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a gentle
grade.  We took a different route.

3.  The ride from Houston to Austin by car is about 160 miles. The route we
took was almost 40 miles further.  The bike ride route displayed on a map
appeared similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an
Aggie to find the shortest distance between two points.

4.  Road kill if far more attractive from a car than from a bike.

5.  The chicken ranch in LaGrange is long gone, but the spirit lingers.  The
LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of the
first day of biking. We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club
volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with
ranch dressing.  I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served, and
wondered whether the historical connection was intentional.

STRATEGY

I knew when I signed up for this event that I had almost no chance of
completing the ride which, at the time I entered, I thought was only 150
miles.  I had not trained at all for the bike ride, and was (and am) not
physically fit and dont exercise as I should.  The total extent of my bike
riding during the year prior to the event was when rode my mountain bike
from my home to a sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the
trip.  Round trip, my "training" ride to the sporting goods store was about
3 miles.

I sufficiently realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some
advantage to make up for the lack of althletic readiness.  I came up with
what I thought was the perfect solution. Before the race started, I looked
for the largest biker I could spot.  My plan was that if I rode my bike
during the ride immediately behind a very large person, I could draft that
person (Nascar style), and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage.  I
thought it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person
had a slower pace than I desired, the advantage would be apparent by the end
of the ride.  Luckily, I found just the person I was seeking---this person
appeared to be about 300-325 pounds--a body that would clear a nice swath of
air for me to follow.  When the race started, I maneuvered my bike and
pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker.   For the
first 5 minutes of the ride, my strategy worked great--I actually could tell
that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly behind this
large person.  Then, the unexpected happened----my large person biker turned
on her afterburners and left me in the dust.  Never again on this bike ride
was I again able to catch and draft another biker.

I needed a new strategy---perhaps a tail wind, which did in fact materialize
in spades,  but not before noon the second day of the ride.

THE RIDE IN DETAIL

I signed up for this event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a
result of my schedule opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily
commited.  I did it largely on  a lark, but the event took on new meaning
when I learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I
started the fund raising effort, which is a required part of participating
as a rider.

I knew I was out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco
in even attempting this strenuous activity.  I agreed that I could not keep
up the normal pace of younger and far more physically fit bikers.  So, I
made a pledge to myself.  No matter what, I was not going to overexert
myself.  I would establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being
winded.  I succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day of
the ride.

I kept a pace that was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride
for the first 4 hours or so, which was mostly level road.  I was very happy
with the ride, and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the
announcer has promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker
when we reached Bellville, about 50 miles from Houston.  When I got to
Bellville, I came to realize that my pace, although not strenous, was
substantially off the mark.  With a box lunch prepared for over 9000 riders,
there were only four box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville. As I
thought back, I remembered being passed by many bikers.  I  did pass, by my
count, 9 bikes before lunch as if they were standing still.  They were.
They all had flat tires.   I decided I needed to pick up the pace at little
after lunch.

I headed out after a quick lunch to try to make up some time.  By around
2:00 to 3:00, I was really getting tired and although still cautious about
over exertion, I was losing energy fast. I stopped at a pay phone booth in
a small town, and called home. I told my 13 year old son William I did not
think I would make it much further.  But I wanted to go as far as I could.
I rode about 10 more miles, and was almost totally out of steam when I
remember thinking "I desparately need a long rest".  About that time, I
looked up at a road sign that said "Cemetery, next exit".  The symbolic
connection was compelling!  I decided it was time to take a rest--a
temporary, not a permanent, one.  I biked past the cemetery where I lay down
in some high grass along the road to catch my breath. The local chiggars and
I bonded almost immediately.  I then flagged down a "SAG" bus, designed to
pick up weary bikers, and got help loading first my bike, then my body, into
a van.  I remember telling the driver that I was "finished" and that I did
not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin.  I was
extremely disappointed because I had gone only about 62 miles, and about 80%
of the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled.  I concluded
I was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal.

After traveling in the van for about 15 miles, we came upon the entrance to
a ranch of a friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago. I
asked the van driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was
home.  I went to visit the friend, but he was not at his ranch house, and I
ended up spending about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him.  I
finally decided to leave, and found that the rest had given me new strength.
I thought I might be able to ride again.  To make a long story short, I rode
for about another 4 hours straight until it was total dark.  A van came and
picked me up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continue. I was
only 3 miles short of LaGrange, our stopover spot for the night, and the van
carried me on to this historic spot.

I had really been looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a
member of Team Enron, and Enron's hospitality for its bike riders was by
reputation, outstanding.  They had hired 40 messeuses to give massages to
the Team Enron bikers, and a dinner fit for a king would be waiting.
Unfortunately, by the time I arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds, our
accomodations for the evening, dinner in the Enron tent was over and all the
masseuses had vanished.  I finally found a general meal service hosted by
the local Rotarians who were serving barbecued chicken, and a salad with
ranch dressing.

Since I didnt enter the bike event until less than two weeks before it
started, Team Enron's private tent was full and I was relegated to find
sleeping space on my own.  I was directed to a huge feedlot covered with a
large tin roof, open air style (no walls).   As I nestled in my sleeping bag
under the big roof with about 2000 other bikers, my senses told me that I
was probably to sleep where a cow going to market had probably slept only
days before.  But I was dog tired, simply wanted to sleep, and didnt have
the energy to find less aeromatic, alternative, accomodations.

THE SECOND DAY

I was told that breakfast would be served at 530 am the next morning, and
that the ride would start at sunup, about 640 am.  I concluded that I could
sleep until 6 am, grab a quick bite, and still be at the starting gate by
640.  Needless to say, I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as
possible.  I badly needed the rest. My plan failed.

I did not take into consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of
gung-ho superbikejocks.  About 4 am, some two hours before I planned to wake
up, a large group of overenenergetic-supercyclists arose and started doing
side straddle hops, stretching, and various exercises while making Monica
Seles-like grunting noises.  I was not amused.  There was no way to go back
to sleep! The five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholly
inadequate.

I was told that Day 2 of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day 1
because of the more hilly route as we approached Austin.  To make a long
story short,  I actually gained strength on Day 2 as compared to Day 1. I
actually learned some technique for transferring power from my arms to my
legs, and made it to Austin on my own power without any motorized help of
any kind.

The ride through the hill country was spectacular.  Also, I did get a taste
of ole country Texas along the way. The bike route intentionally meanders
via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy highway traffic
for the safety of the bikers.  As we passed through one small town that I
never heard of before, I looked up to see a sign that said  "THELMA'S
PLACE---POOL, BEER DOMINOS". A sign of equal size immediately adjacent said
"NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE".  It was comforting to know that patrons of that
establishment could drink peacefully while game playing, knowing that
customers are  required to go out to the parking lot to resolve domino
disagreements where guns are not prohibited.  I guess I have spent too much
time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas, and have forgotten about the
genuine Texas back country!!

There was one other noteworthy diversion.  Cycling through Bastrop State
Park is known to be one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of
the extreme winding hills in this beautiful, heavily-wooded area.  The Park
is also confusing because of its multiple intersecting roads through the
park. I was following another biker as we approached the park who was
sporting a very fancy biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club.  I
mentioned to him that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State
Park because of the challenging steep hills.  He responded that he knew a
route through the park that was not only less hilly, but was also 3 miles
shorter than the route intended for the bikers.  I was all ears to the
prospect of a short cut, and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and
shorter route.  We entered the park and,  for the next 10 miles according to
my odometer, it seemed like a roller coaster ride, with turning steep
inclines, and dangerously steep and turning declines.  Exactly one hour and
ten minutes after we entered the park, we finally exited the
park--------------at the exact same place where we entered.  I was exhausted
and not amused.  I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to
find the shortest route to Austin.

To fast forward the story, since this has been far too long already, I made
it to Austin on my own power and did not ask for a lift at all the second
day.  I was looking forward to getting a much needed shower when I arrived
at the finishing line at the UT baseball stadium in Austin.  I had put in my
most strenuous effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the very
hilly Austin area where every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kissing
cousin.  Unfortunately for the person who sat next to me on the bus coming
back to Houston, I was told just after crossing the finish line that the
last bus would leave for Houston in only a few minutes and there was no time
to shower.  At that point in time, I looked like I just stepped out of a
sweat shower.  The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what I
dreaded--he introduced himself, and waited for a reply.  I really didn't
want this guy to know my name--the name  of the guy who was giving the bus
the aroma of gymnasium locker room---- so after a moments thought, I held
out my still sweaty hand, and proudly said, "Howdy, my name's Harry
Reasoner."

Conclusion:

I participated in this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and
others who are victims of MS.  If you previously made one of those weirdo
pledges that are impossible for anyone to calculate, please send my
secretary a check made payable to National Multiple Sclerosis Society in
whatever amount makes you happy.  If you have not made a donation, won't you

do so today? You will benefit by giving as much as the people with MS who
need your help.  Thank you.

Mark, would you please furnish me the name of the William, Cutler attorney that you are dealing with? Thank you. Jim

Jim,

we find ourselves negotiating continental power trading documents and credit provisions with Wilmer Cutler's New York office, acting for Morgan Stanley. I wonder if that conflict was raised when WC were instructed to act on the SEC inquiry?

							Mark

Robert, please advise Vance re this.  Thank you. Jim
 

Jim -- 

We would appreciate your blessing on this revised Q&A for the web.  All of the questions previously of most concern to you have been removed.  We have added in a question about related parties and basically put in the broad FASB parameters.  The Q&A enables us to stick in some fashion to the commitment Ken made on the last analyst call while also removing some low-end calls into public relations from people who have no idea what any of this means.

I believe this e-mail was sent to me in error.

Dori;

I realized there is a problem with disabling all of our local accounts.  We use the local accounts to log on to the posting tool.  We need access for production support.

Access to the posting tool does not require us to be admin users, but to be part of the postadmin_grp.

If you have questions, please let me know.

Thanks.

FYI:

As part of the continued cleanup of the production IIS environment on the DMZ I am making some more changes. These changes are meant to secure the production environment and stabilize the server.

All local admin ID's will be disabled ( except for existing service accounts)
All web development persons should access the server with HotTap domain ID's and not local ID's
NO PC Anywhere access will be granted except for server support personnel
Any server changes will need to be made by the Server Support team or HotTap Support team ( ODBC settings, IIS settings, ...etc)

We will make sure that all domain accounts have the permissions needed to function properly. Please let us know ASAP if you need more rights than given and we will correct it immediately.   

We are also working to migrate the SQL services off of X12 by the end of the week. This should help stabilize the server and free up resources.

Thanks for your help and patience.

I have instructed David Oxley by voice mail that this matter is not to proceed until legal and tax have approved it.  He has responded, in a voice mail that I have forwarded to Sharon Butcher, that he will not proceed until approval is given.  I assume you and Sharon will take it from here. Jim

Jim, Rex is out of pocket, and this issue may spin out of my control or influence before the day is over.  Pat

I propose that we send the following to Kristina from Jim:

  "Re:  LJM1 Issues

Kristina,

Thank you for providing information about LJM1 to Wilmer Cutler.  

Until we have more clarity about the issues with respect to LJM1, we believe it is advisable that you do not work on any transaction involving a sale of assets to LGM1, LGM2, or any related entities.

Please call me if you have any questions about the foregoing."

Please let me know if you agree and I will prepare this for Jim's signature.

Thank you.

Hi Mark,
I am a former investor, and received a complaint in yesterday's mail from
Bernstein, Liebhard & Lifshitz.  Although their complaint may have some
merit, they fail to point out that in early 2001 (1/21/2001- I bought @ 70
1/8 & sold 9 days later @ 79.5), there was significant press relating to
the energy crisis- Lack of electricity in California, and shortages of
petroleum reserves, etc.  That is why I bought.  I saw an opportunity for
energy companies overall, with regards to sales volume & earnings
potential.
So, although their claims may (or may not) have substantive legal merit
(with regards to the  Limited Partnership debacle), I, and perhaps others,
bought and/or sold the stock due to circumstances related only to the
energy crises, and opportunities related therein.
Although I'm a small investor (traded only $ 1,540 worth of shares, as
noted above), feel free to write if I can help.

Jim -- I've begun the pairings process for the golf tournament. At your convenience, could you please let me know your handicap and also if there is anyone in particular that you would like in your group. It looks like a handicap of 16 or lower will put you in the "A" player category.

Thanks for your support and guidance on the AFS memorial. I'm working with Fran Berg to make sure we handle the presentation appropriately.  

Mark, which attorney is handling this matter? Jim

Jeff / John,

We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals =
Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi=
ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und=
erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft=
er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co=
ncur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sh=
eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please =
let us know.

Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe Gold

Introduction

Enron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. =
 EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service=
s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining b=
rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i=
ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L=
ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato=
ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other b=
usinesses:
1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato=
ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus=
iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d=
isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.

2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst=
ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's p=
olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's cond=
uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship=
 to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th=
e FSA and the LME.

3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an=
d to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidi=
ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la=
ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co=
nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain =
prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi=
tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA =
regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc=
e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem=
ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be =
used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded =
as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ=
irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c=
ease carrying on business.

4)=09EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o=
versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for=
 a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines=
 and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members=
 under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r=
elating to directors' duties.

Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation

In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem=
onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng=
th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t=
he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation =
we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.

Issues Surrounding Liquidity

As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl=
ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th=
e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio=
n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the =
goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing =
of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t=
he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli=
shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp=
any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was=
 concerned =20

The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains=
 and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,=
 it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap=
ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its=
 day to day liquidity.=20
=20
In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp=
oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (=
LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater=
al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc=
ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and =
the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it=
 must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu=
al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre=
d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-=
money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th=
ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr=
ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest=
ions.

Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari=
os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce=
rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to =
fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from=
 the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l=
osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of c=
ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC'=
s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be=
 transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the re=
maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be =
withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid=
ity impact.

The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo=
r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have =
agreed to start to do the following
a.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid=
ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t=
he rest of the enterprise
b.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control=
 as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel
c.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints=
 of continuing to do business on a normal basis
d.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis
e.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a=
s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity
f.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi=
onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou=
r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis

Operational Risk =20

In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account=
s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash =
needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p=
ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca=
ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I=
f EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, =
it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco=
unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either=
 capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be=
 substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi=
ght create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much f=
aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.

Capital

As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and mu=
st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th=
at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan=
cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions=
 when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v=
iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo=
rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain=
s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer =
not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the=
 FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari=
se from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those =
violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga=
tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh=
t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM=
L's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily =
basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev=
el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces=
s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20

Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing

The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce=
narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML

1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte=
rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral=
 rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac=
count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME =
brokers
4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i=
nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca=
sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=20
5)=09Credit exposures leading to credit losses

Recommendations

The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following=
 changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov=
erall operational liquidity

1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s=
ubordinated facility
2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)
3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi=
ty by six months to July 2002
4)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi=
ts and other assets held by EML
5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch=
 to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol=
d for calling margin
6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th=
an a select group of key relationship clients=20
7)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c=
ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance

Current Situation

Unsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mm
Secured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mm

we find ourselves negotiating continental power trading documents and credit provisions with Wilmer Cutler's New York office, acting for Morgan Stanley. I wonder if that conflict was raised when WC were instructed to act on the SEC inquiry?

The Board has asked for a draft communications plan.  Attached is an outline.  Obviously, it is a bit premature to finalize the plan, so this presentation just reviews different scenarios.

Please  proceed with Jonathan Gaisman. Jim
Jim -

Linklaters and an Enron rep interviewed QC candidates in London that can
help with our commercial PRI policy issues on Dabhol.  The commercial
policies are governed by UK law.  The best pick appears to be Jonathan
Gaisman.

I'd like your permission to retain and put some of our PRI policy questions
to Mr. Gaisman.

Thanks,
Bruce

Bruce,

Peter, Sophie and I met with all four QC's this morning.

The clear choice, in all of our minds, is Jonathan Gaisman.  (See attached
file: Jonathan Gaisman.doc)His litigation practice is prinicipally
insurance related.  He has done political risk insurance matters relating
to Eastern Europe.  He spoke definitively about practices of different
underwriters in the market (i.e., to re-insure, to craft policies, etc.) He
knows, quite well, the small community of barristers who may be called upon
by Lloyds to handle this.  His wife is from India (though Scottish) and he
spends holiday time there and knows the country and the people.  He worked
on North Sea disputes representing Enron in the past.  He is
straightforward, inquisitive, prepared, thoughtful, and interested in
working on this with us.  He is also used to working with large American
clients.  The downside is that, in his words, he does "not have limitless
time."  He is expecting to be involved in a rather large case in the first
half of next year.

Alistair Schaff was not a very seasoned barrister, and unprepared for our
meeting (in the sense that he hadn't even bothered to read anything about
us or the case before we got there  --  I did not get the sense he was too
busy to do so).  He has worked on de facto 'takings' in Iraq cases, and has
had a number of cases that have involved questions of mitigation.  In
addition, he seemed familiar with the option to sue clause in many
policies.  He has done some work in the distant past with the GOI on
letters of credit and shipping matters.  He was the only one that mentioned
that we might spend some time in the near term thinking about what events
we might 'cause' to occur that could help our claims.

Richard Jacobs is a fairly young barrister, but had read up on our case and
did some preliminary research on case law on political risk insurance
issues (which, incidentally, all four barristers agree hardly exists).  He
did some PRI work in Russia in the early 1990s, and represented brokers in
a lender PRI claim regarding a South Seas power station. He stated that
many insurance coverage issues (no matter the type of policy) are basically
the same questions with a different twist.    Interestingly, he has just
given some advice to a European investor about a dispute in India on a
power plant (contractual matter, not insurance related).  He definitely
grasped that a detailed review of the facts would be the driver for an
expropriation claim.  He has travelled to India.  He has capacity to work
with us in the next 4-8 weeks and beyond.  He would be a solid guy to use
as a back-up.

Stewart Boyd, as you will recall from his CV, is an experienced barrister
(58 years old), who sits as an international arbitrator often. He has a
relationship with Lord Mustill, for what that is worth.  He does alot of
insurance and re-insurance work, though he says that not many political
risk insurance cases have reached the bar.  He has worked on a leading case
involving ECGD, and was, interestingly, an expert witness in an OPIC
coverage case recently.  {We may consider him for just that role, on the
DIC issue, should we decide to sue in Texas.} He has dealt with many
projects of this type and magnitude, from a contractual dispute point of
view, and done quite a bit of work in the electricity sector on
privatization matters.  He has done a couple of projects (shipping and
petroleum industry) in India.  He is available for the next couple of
weeks, booked for most of December, and then frees up again.  I would rank
him a strong second choice.

I would propose that we issue Gaisman instructions tomorrow or Monday.  If
you agree, let me know and I will take care of it.

Over and above my self-serving interest in having the work, on a  very personal level I'd like to be able to help out.
 
In case it is needed, another copy  of my resume is attached.  
 
Good luck, Jim, and hang  tough.

On Thursday November 9, Judge Richard Aikens of the High Court in London heard oral arguments from the parties' counsel as to whether he should grant Reliance's application to appeal certain points decided by the arbitrators in the partial awards rendered in the case of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. vs. Reliance and ONGC.

On Friday November 10, the judge issued a letter denying Reliance's application, with a statement to the effect that he would issue a formal order with reasons at a later date.

The judge has now given Reliance (and ONGC) a deadline of November 19 to submit to him (if they so choose) a justification as to whether he should allow them to appeal his decision to the English Court of Appeal.

By copy of this note I request Mike Smalling to forward to Larry, Rick, and Radha a copy of the judge's letter of November 10.

Jim -- We have been getting a large number of media calls about the 14A filing, which discusses Ken Lay's change of control provision in his contract.  We would like to use the following with media -- and internal meetings with employees:

	Change of control provisions are very common at the CEO level.  Ken has had a change of control provision in his employment contract since 1989.  It enables him to trigger an involuntary termination in the event of a change of control, which includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation and Enron is not the surviving corporation.  This would have gone into effect in the event of a hostile takeover or the announced merger with Dynegy.

Please let me know ASAP if we are able to use this statement.

Thank you.

Gail, I will support your recommendation. Jim

	As you might recall from the monthly litigation reports, Enron America del Sur has been involved in an ongoing dispute with Central Piedra Buena ("CPB") relating to approximately $3.3 million that Enron claims it is owed pursuant to a 1999 natural gas sales agreement. 
	 More specifically, pursuant to the sales agreement, Enron was to sell natural gas to CPB.  Enron bought this gas from a gas distribution company called Total.  The sales agreement and the purchase agreement contained similar provisions and Enron acted primarily as a middleman in the transactions. 
	Beginning in December 1999, after a change in CPB's management, CPB stopped paying Enron for the gas that was supplied.  As a basis for non-payment, CPB claimed that Enron had made numerous mistakes in calculating what was due from CPB.  CPB also made vague allegations of wrongdoing on Enron's part. The parties (including Total) have been negotiating for months in an effort to resolve their disputes; however, these negotiations have been unsuccessful.
	We would like approval to initiate an arbitration against CPB for the money they owe us which, in turn, we owe to Total. Although we believe that CPB may have set-off rights for a very small amount of the sums claimed, their failure to make any reasonable offer to resolve this matter has necessitated that we resort to arbitration.
	  Guido Tawil of the Bomchil firm has been helping us in our efforts to negotiate a settlement and would represent Enron in the arbitration.  Pursuant to the parties' agreement, this would be an ICC arbitration, would occur in Buenos Aires and Argentine law would apply. Additionally, several arbitrators have been interviewed and, in Guido's opinion, our best choice is Sergio La Pera, a commercial law specialist who has a good bit of experience as an arbitrator.  According to Guido, Mr. La Pera is available and wiling to serve on the arbitration panel.
	Should you need any additional information or have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Mark,

I'd be grateful if we could have a short conversation today at a convenient time to suit you to discuss:

1. The West LB LC facility. Corp still has not formed a view on whether we can give the "no material litigation" rep. so we cannot revert to West LB. Apart from the ?55m potentially available from WLB, Enron Europe now have NO LC facilities available. This is hurting us. Even if the answer is negative, at least we could give WLB a clear answer and negotiate to draw down on the facility.

2. Wrongful trading comfort. The directors having taken independent advice and been told that some fairly low level comfort is needed from Houston, noise and nervousness is now growing at this end because it has not been forthcoming. I attach a draft which would suffice.

 
Can we please talk about how we can get Jeff McMahon to send this to Michael Brown.

3.ICI Counterindemnities and TXU: I discussed these with Jeff Hodge yesterday. Do you need anything more from me on these?   

Thanks

							Mark

Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 

2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 

That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 

That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.

Chuck:

Wanted to pass along my appreciation to you for considering Ad Hoc Legal
Resources in filling Britt Davis' recent need for a temporary paralegal.
 As you probably know, our employee, Barbara O'Banion, started in the
position earlier this week.  I will be calling Britt soon to check on
Barbara's progress.

On a separate note, I want to offer you our services as you and your legal
team strategize your defense of the recent shareholder suits.  Ad Hoc has
been an integral component in staffing complex, multi-party litigation for
companies of your size -- we have supplied as many as 90 temps on a single
piece of litigation.  We have considerable experience designing and
recruiting flexible, cost-efficient teams of knowledgeable legal
professionals who can handle the routine aspects of a document review,
while your permanent staff works on more sophisticated matters.  Likewise,
as your transactional counterparts at Enron begin working on the merger's
due diligence review, I hope Ad Hoc can offer its experience.  We supplied
the largest number of temporary lawyers and paralegals to conduct document
reviews in both the El Paso/Coastal and Exxon/Mobil mergers.  We were also
involved in the Chevron/Texaco merger and the Waste Management buyout.

Please do not hesitate to call on me at any time if I can be of assistance.
 Again, thank you for confidence in our services.

Best regards,

Beth Moore
President

The law firm of Baker & McKenzie is currently assisting Christopher Wood out of Enron Europe on the wind company's behalf in connection with the formation of a joint venture to provide wind turbine maintenance services on several wind turbines that we are proposing to place in service in Japan.  The legal services are being provided out of Baker & McKenzie's Tokyo office.  The attorney contact is Paul Davis.  Please let me know if you need any further information.

Rob/Jim -

B&M's affiliate in The Philippines has represented us for years.  They are
actively engaged in our efforts to sell Batangas and Subic back to The
Phillipines.

B&M's affiliate in Japan represented Enron in Japan.  Supervision of this
work is now out of London so I'm not sure of current status.

I believe that one of our Brazil law firms is also a B&M affiliate.  I'm
copying this to John Novak for more input.

I'll look into any others.

Over the past 2 years I have used Baker & McKenzie for a number of transactions executed by EEL in London. The last transaction involved a Subpart F analysis confirmation relating to a $600mil payment received by EEL associated with the Teesside PPA's.

I have not worked with them since 4th quarter 2000.

Hello Jim,
Boy, it must be quite hectic for you and your  staff.  I trust you are in a protected position, and that the buyout will  be advantageous to you personally.  You are a terrific person, and I know  you are invaluable to Enron; I believe you will do quite well, whatever  happens.   Just wanted you to know I'm thinking positive thoughts for  you. Toby

Mark, I am forwarding this message and several more related to it.  I would appreciate your sending them to the attorney who is working on this and asking him or her to advise me re the requested vote.  Thank you. Jim,

Bill, I want to thank you and your team for everything you are doing to assist our cause.  I am confident that, together, we shall ultimately prevail.  Good luck on the appeal.  All the best.  Jim

Kelly, I am fine with your proposed retention of Mr. Graykowski.  All the best.  Jim

Jim,

I have been asked by the management of Mariner to seek your approval of
Mariner's retention of John E. Graykowski, a partner at Dyer Ellis & Joseph
in D.C., for an upcoming project finance matter.  Until recently, John was
the Deputy Maritime Administrator (MARAD)responsible for implementing the
National Shipbuilding Initiative, with particular emphasis on the Title XI
Loan Guarantee Program. The project Mariner wants to utilize John for is the
potential financing, through bonds guaranteed by MARAD, of the construction
of a $50-60MM portable deepwater production facility. Given his ties with
MARAD, John is uniquely qualified for this project, but I want to make sure
you have no conflict issues or other concerns with John or his firm.

If you would like more information on John or Dyer Ellis, or you have any
other questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Kelly Zelikovitz

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

FYI

Dear All

You may have recently received a letter from Companies House regarding the overdue accounts for TME Engineers Limited, for the period ending 30 April 2000. This letter will be sent to all directors of the Company.

The accounts for this Company were due to be filed at the end of February 2001. Unfortunately a filing extension request (form 244) was never filed and the accounts must now be filed by 3 December at the latest to avoid penalties being incurred. 

The April accounts require a Letter of Comfort to be supplied from Enron, and in the current situation this will not be possible within the timescale for filing. (The Letter of Comfort is required as the Company requires inter-company loans to remain in place for the Company to remain solvent). 

To solve this problem, the Balance Sheet of TME Engineers Limited is being restructured to ensure the directors can sign on a going concern basis, and this will be arranged within the next few days. Peter Pentecost will be calling each of you over the next couple of days to explain the background to the problem more fully and to outline the solution/answer any questions you may have.  

In case for any reason the restructure of the Balance Sheet cannot be completed by the 3 December deadline, we are agreeing with Arthur Andersen an alternative basis for the audit opinion to be signed, such that the Accounts can still be signed off and submitted by the Directors in time. 

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue,  please contact Brian Muscroft on 0044 207 783 2703.

You probably know about this case already, but this was filed this week in Federal Court: 
Pamela Tittle et al. v. Enron Corp. et al. 
11/13/2001-3913 
The description of the facts are: 
Possible class action ERISA violation case in which the defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties to an Enron employee retirement plan by misrepresenting the financial status of hedging agreements made with third party partnerships.
The plaintiff's attorney is Robin Harrison.  I know Robin quite well.  He does not do that much employment work, and is more of a commercial litigator.  As you know, I have done a substantial amount of ERISA work and would be interested in helping Enron out on this case.  Please let me know what we can do to help.

Please see the proposed agenda for our meeting in San Antonio next Wednesday.  I look forward to seeing you there.  All the best.  Jim

 

Jeff, Rex Rogers should work on this. Jim

It is my understanding that:
After taking into account the recent preferred with Dynegy, Enron has limited authorized shares for further private equity; 
A shareholders meeting is necessary to authorize additional shares; and
A shareholders meeting requires a 30-day notice period.

In order to be safe, I think we need an additional 250 million authorized shares - in order to comfortably raise up to $2.0+ billion - although the first tranche will likely be $800 to $900 million.

Who is the right person to take the lead in this matter?

Jeff Donahue

Bob--in reviewing the Merger Q & A dated Nov 9 in "Enron Updates", I think there has been a typo or a misunderstanding on whoever put together the "Answers" about how options will be converted.  

The existing Answer as to how options will be converted is as follows:
	"The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted.  Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close.  At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided (sic) by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options."

I believe the strike price should be multiplied by the merger ratio [or at the very least stay the same].  If it is done the way the current "Answer" suggests, Enron option holders take a double hit---the shares they have options on are reduced by three quarters and the strike prices [which were already under water] get multiplied by four.  I would guess that application of the current "Answer"  totally eliminates all existing options, as a practical matter.

I'm pretty sure I am right.  Have the Answer people made a typo or misunderstood how conversion is to take place, or is there a problem with the existing merger agreement that needs to be addressed and corrected?  Please advise.

Please proceed. Thank you.

I will ask Steve Susman whether there is any reason they should not also handle the defense of this case.  I think we want to concentrate our defenses in as few firms as possible.  Please let me know if you disagree.

Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only "recognised" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.

Hi Jim,

Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
little bit, at least.

The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
inaugural meeting are as follows:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
and (maybe) Green;

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
(maybe) Green;

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.

Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?

Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
have, amid all the other matters on your plate.

David

 

I have told David Winn that January 23 seems to work best. Please note that date on the calendar.  Thank you.

I can imagine the firestorm and I trust you would let me know if we could
somehow be of assistance. I can't think of a better group to weather the
circumstances than you and your extremely talented team.

I will keep this brief. Carrin requested an asset allocation model based on

including the detail of your assets in a presentation to Carrin.

We hoped to respond to Carrin today but I will not do so until I hear from

Les, thank you, as always, for your support and friendship.  I hope your Thanksgiving is a great one. All the best. Jim

Jim, I continue to see that Enron is dominating a large section of the
energy industry news these days.  I hope everything is going well for you
and that when everything shakes out you will, as always, come out shining.

Best wishes, Les

Frank, Elaine has all of the information you have requested.  Jim

Mr. Derrick,

Like last year, we are preparing the Director's Disclosures in connection with our filing of the 2000 audited financial statements of our Singapore office.  This disclosure requires certain information regarding your holdings of Enron stock and stock options.  Regarding stock options, I have requested the necessary information from Elaine Overturf (Corporate Secretary's office), however, I need the following information regarding your Enron Corp (ENE) stock holdings:

Balance at beginning year?  (should be 69,013 shares, the ending balance shown on last year's disclosure) (please confirm this amount)
Acquired during the year?
Disposed during the year?
Balance at end of year?

Once I have obtain this information, I will forward the completed disclosure forms for your signature.

Thank you,
Frank Lobdell
(ext. 6-7831)

I support your suggestiion.

	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the "Method and System for the Determination of VAR").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

	  

Mark, I would appreciate your forwarding this to the appropriate attorney in London with the request that these questions be answered.  Thank you.  All the best. Jim

Hi there, following up from my call earlier...

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards
Lauren Christie

Mark, please forward this to the appropriate attorney with the request that he or she advise me regarding the requested action set forth below.  Thank you. Jim

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

It looks like an Oregonian investigative reporter is trying to  put a story together suggesting that our management advised  employees that they should be investing in Enron stock through  their 401Ks (see attached note from our public affairs).   
 
Jim (or Rob), should we be conferring with Enron defense  counsel on this, and if so who?  dn
Date: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 17:34:21 -0800
Jeff Manning at The Oregonian called to say tomorrow's newspaper will have  another report on the Enron 401(k) problems, and the connection to PGE through  the details of three lawsuits. I said nothing new, but did clarify a quote that  had appeared from PGE in the previous story Manning wrote.
 
I've copied Doug on this because the issue is getting more serious.  Manning informed me that The Oregonian has now assigned him and Gail Hill  to "charge ahead and do more on this story." They want to sit down with HR and  review documentation that proves that we have provided financial planning  counsel, that we have provided information about diversifying portfolios, etc.  This is strongly leaning in the legal area, and we would like to have  counsel before saying anything further. We can't expect much cover from Enron,  either: Manning vented to me about how no one there will return his calls.
 
Carol, Gail, Kregg and I can be available to meet early tomorrow to discuss  how to move ahead on this. Doug, let us know if sometime before noon might work  for you. Thanks.

John, we used Shearman & Sterling in connection with our dispute with Peru in respect of the nationalization of our offshore oil and gas properties.  We haven't done too much with them since then.  Jim

Wessex's regulatory lawyer, Chris Bright, has just joined Shearman and Sterling from Clifford Chance.  Until late 1998, he was with Linklaters, Wessex's corporate counsel when it was publicly traded.

Jim, does Enron have a good relationship with Shearman and Sterling?  Though I haven't talked with the Wessex folks, I'm sure Wessex would want to continue using Chris--he is really good.

Mark, please forward this to the appropriate attorney and ask him or her to review this and advise me re the request below. Thank you. Jim

Please excuse me for in turn chasing you about this; I certainly appreciate
that you will have more important matters at your hands to deal with these

Dear Mr. Derrick,

I was prompted to contact you because your position as general counsel
gives you such a broad view of all legal aspects at Enron.  You may be able
to point me in the right direction: my firm provides due diligence services
in foreign countries (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe, China and
Taiwan).  Our due diligence inquiries are motivated by the clients' need to
have full information on the companies and individuals with which they are
dealing abroad.  Often, our due diligence inquiries have a focus on FCPA
issues.  We have assisted clients from the energy industry (Air Liquide,
Chevron, ExxonMobil).

You may be able to refer me to counsel in your department who deal with
such issues, or you may be interested in meeting me.  I will be in Houston
on May 7 and 8.  I could stop by your office for 30 minutes for a brief
presentation.

If you know of such a person, please respond to Monsanto.  Thank you. Jim

Monsanto has need for a very strong lawyer to handle an effort by a state
official to politicize our biotechnology. We need a lawyer who can related

help with names would be greatly appreciated.

I am fine with your recommendation. Jim

i wanted to summarize where we are on this:

1. the agreement is governed by california law and enforceable in the bankruptcy court. it has a jury trial waiver.
2. it obligates enron corp. and its affiliates. jim please advise if you think that i need to get further approvals for this here or if that has been discussed in the context of asking to be on the committee etc.
3. it lasts generally through the duration of the case even if we resign from the committee. 
4. we are continuing to struggle some with what ethical wall we should obligate ourselves to re trading activities. we are ok with the language re trading in securities and the chinese wall procedures we have in place re those, but it is the commodity trading activities (and tangentially credit derivative activities) that need more thought. mark, i am talking with lance schuler and mark taylor and leboeuf re these and have call into ken raisler at sullivan. i keep thinking that this must have been addressed in the context of a few other cases, but leboeuf and milbank don't think so. dynegy doesn't seem to have thought much about it or the words on the pieces of paper although they now realize they have some of the same issues and we are talking to them. i am hopeful that we will have worked through specific procedures very shortly so that we can come back to you mark with whether you think work and then should be discussed and reviewed commercially.

Peter, your proposed counsel picks are fine by me. Jim

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM (US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.

ATTENTION:

DEAR SIR,

A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE/COOPERATION

IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE IN WRITING YOU THIS LETTER ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AND ME.  YOUR PARTICULARS WERE GIVEN TO ME BY A MEMBER OF THE NIGERIAN EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL (NNPC) WHO WAS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DELEGATION TO YOUR COUNTRY DURING A TRADE EXHIBITION.  I HAVE DECIDED TO SEEK A CONFIDENTIAL COOPERATION WITH YOU IN THE EXECUTION OF THE DEAL DESCRIBED HERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES INVOLVED AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL KEEP IT AS TOP SECRET BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND THE PERSONALITIES INVOLVED.

WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES WHERE I WORK AS A DIRECTOR, PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND WITH THE COOPERATION OF FOUR OTHER TOP OFFICIALS, WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION AS OVER-DUE PAYMENT BILLS TOTALLING $30.5M USD (THIRTY MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) WHICH WE WANT TO TRANSFER ABROAD WITH THE ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION OF A TRUSTED FOREIGN FIRM OR INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL RECEIVE THE SAID FUND ON OUR BEHALF INTO ANY ACCOUNT PROVIDED TO RECEIVE SUCH FUNDS.  WE ARE HANDICAPPED IN THIS DEAL BECAUSE THE CIVIL SERVICE CODE OF
CONDUCT DOES NOT ALLOW PUBLIC SERVANTS LIKE US TO OPERATE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT, HENCE YOUR IMPORTANCE IN THE WHOLE TRANSACTION.

THE AMOUNT $18.6M USD REPRESENTED SOME PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE EXECUTED ON BEHALF OF MY MINISTRY BY A FOREIGN CONTRACTING FIRM WHICH WE THE OFFICIALS OVER-INVOICED DELIBERATELY. THOUGH THE ACTUAL CONTRACT COST HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR, LEAVING THE BALANCE IN THE TUNE OF THE SAID AMOUNT WHICH WE HAVE GOTTEN APPROVAL TO REMIT BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER (T.T.) TO
FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT YOU WILL PROVIDE BY FILING IN AN APPLICATION THROUGH MY MINISTRY FOR THE TRANSFER OF RIGHT AND PRIVILEGES OF THE FORMER CONTRACTOR TO YOU.

SINCE THE PRESENT NEW CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY IS DETERMINED TO PAY EVERY FOREIGN CONTRACTOR ALL DEBTS OWED, SO AS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL FINANCIAL AGENCIES, WE HAVE DECIDED TO INCLUDE OUR BILL FOR APPROVALS WITH THE COOPERATION OF SOME OFFICIALS FROM THE ALL THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY WHICH WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PAYMENT PROCESS.

WE ARE SEEKING YOUR ASSISTANCE IN PROVIDING A VITAL  ACCOUNT INTO WHICH WE CAN REMIT THIS MONEY BY ACTING AS OUR MAIN PARTNER AND TRUSTEE OR ACTING AS THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR.  THIS WE CAN DO BY SWAPPING OF ACCOUNT AND CHANGING OF BENEFICIARY AND OTHER FORMS OF DOCUMENTATION UPON APPLICATION FOR CLAIM TO REFLECT THE PAYMENT AND APPROVALS TO BE SECURED ON BEHALF OF YOU.

THIS PROCESSES BEING AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PRINCIPAL TRUSTEE OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR AND WITH THE CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR. I HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF MY PARTNERS INVOLVED TO PROPOSE THAT SHOULD YOU BE
WILLING TO ASSIST US IN THE TRANSACTION, YOUR SHARE OF THE SUM WILL BE 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM, 60% FOR US AND 10% FOR TAXATION AND MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES.

THE BUSINESS IS 100% SAFE ON YOUR PART, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL.  DO NOT INFORM YOUR BANKER YET UNLESS INSTRUCTED BY US.  IN ADDITION, YOUR AREA OF SPECIALIZATION IS NOT A HIDERANCE TO THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THIS TRANSACTION.  I HAVE REPOSED MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT DISAPPOINT ME.  PLEASE FAX ME ON 234-1-7597374, OR SEND EMAIL TO okigbo2@messagez.com TO INDICATE YOUR WILLINGNESS IN
ASSISTING US SO THAT I WILL DIRECT YOU ON WHAT NEXT TO DO.

PLEASE FAX OR E-MAIL INCLUDE YOUR DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS IF YOU ARE RESPONDING BY FAX.

I am ok with your proposal. Jim
As you know, EES is positioning itself to supply power to retail customers
in Massachusetts.  In order to do so, it must enter a Competitive Electric
Service Supplier Agreement with a local utility, Western Mass.  The
agreement governs the relationship between EES and the utility (subject to
the utility's tariff and PUC regulations), and mainly concerns billing and
other administrative matters.   I would not expect large dollar disputes to
arise under the agreement (barring another California situation).  The
agreement presently calls for arbitration in Boston of any disputes.  There
are no rules specified.  I recommend that we agree to arbitration in Boston
but specify that:  (1) the Federal Arbitration Act will apply (to give a
legal framework to the arbitration and to enable EES to invoke federal
court jurisdiction); (2) the arbitration will be conducted in accordance
with the CPR Rules for Self-Administered Arbitrations (although AAA or JAMS
would also be acceptable);  and (3) one arbitrator will be used in the
amount in dispute is less than $1 million but if greater then the parties
will use a panel of three arbitrators, with each party selecting one (under
CPR Rules the two party appointed arbitrators select the chair or, failing
agreement, the CPR submits a list of 5 from which the chair is determined
by the highest order of preference of the parties).   Please let me know if
this meets your approval.  Thanks.

Bob, I have no information regarding these individuals. Jim

Blockbuster's counsel has suggested the following retired federal judges as potential arbitrators:  Kathleen Roberts, Harold Tyler, H. Lee Sarokin.  Please let me know if we have ever used any of them before or if you have any information about them.  Thank you.

Walt, the East Lake proposal sounds great IF it fits into your schedule.  I plan to return to Houston either Wednesday morning or Wednesday afternoon, depending on whether we do or do not play East Lake.  Please do not reschedule any meetings you have just to enable us to play Wednesday morning-- Austusta will certainly have been excitement enough.  I am leaving Houston tomorrow morning and will not be able to check e-mail after this afternoon, so if you need to reach me drop me a voice mail at 713-853-5550. All the best.  Jim  

Here's the drill.
I understand that Jim will come here on Sunday night. We'll book him a room
at the Atlanta Ritz-Carlton, right next to the office.
Bobby will arrive Monday in time for lunch and we'll set up a few people
anxious to talk to Jim after lunch.
We will leave here about 4:15 to arrive and drive down Magnolia Lane at 6:30
p.m. Take a tour, have a putting contest or whatever, drinks and dinner.
Next morning we'll play 18, have lunch and play either the par 3 or another
nine, then leave about 4:30 to get Sam back to Atlanta in time for a dinner
he has here that night.Jim and Bobby could catch any plane after about 9 or
spend the night here. Let us know if you want hotel reservations for Tuesday
night. If so, do you want to play East Lake Wed. a.m.?
NO SHORTS,ONLY LONG PANTS at Augusta.
I think no cell phones, too. I have the caddies yardage book, which the
three of us can memorize on the way over.
Sam shot 69!!!! last weekend at a nearby course, so we'll see if the secret
can stay around that long.
This will be great fun and we are all looking forward to it.

Walt, Bobby and I have talked and agreed to save East Lake for another time.  I will return to Houston Wednesday morning.  I look forward to seeing you. Jim

I have commitments on Wed. a.m., but we are a corporate member at East Lake,
so I'll book a tee time that Wed. a.m. so you and Bobby can play and I'm
sure we can find some volunteers here to join you.

I will be pleased to meet with Kersten and his partners.  I would appreciate your coordinating schedules with him. Thank you.

Dear Jim:

I am planning to be in Houston later this month when two of my Moscow-based
partners, Bruce Bean and Ivan Marisin, will be speaking there at a
Production Sharing conference. Once being in Houston, I would very much like
to pay you a visit, remembering the invitatiuon you kindly extended to me
when visiting our offices a couple of years ago. Of course, I would also
like to introduce to you Bruce and Ivan, both of whom do work in the energy
field and in other areas Enron is active in.

We expect to arrive in Houston in the afternoon of Tuesday May 29 and depart
in the afternoon of Thursday May 31. It would be great if you we were to
have some time for us, and I would appreciate it very much if you could send
me a brief email and let me know whether a meeting with you might work out.

Independently, I will also try to contact Mark Haedicke so as to see whether
I could se him again, too.

With best regards

Gentlemen:

I have watched your success that is reported almost
daily in the news. I have seen your team in action as
competition and possible partner as I've helped
Loudcloud close major outsourcing services
transactions with Ford, Citigroup entities, Network
Appliances and the likes of Estee Lauder and others.
Your team is impressive and so is your mission. I will
shortly end my short tenure at Loudcloud as a deal
lawyer focused on drafting, structuring and
negotiating partner alliance and customer side complex
outsourcing arrangements. Energy, power and bandwidth
issues have and will continue to be central to a
growing and stable econony here and abroad. I would
love to join your team. I would be thrilled to talk to
the appropriate person about an opportunity as a deal
lawyer or as part of your solutions team.

As background (rez attached),
-- I have been a transactional lawyer for about 9
years and am comfortable structuring, negotiating and
closing complex outsourcing, partner and software or
technology related transactions.  Training stints
include Cooley Godward and several private equity
funded entities in the US, Germany and Japan.
-- I thrive on direct P&L responsibility for growing a
business' revenue through straight customer, channel
partner arrangements, multi-party revenue sharing, and
structures that leverage technology, IP and human
resources.  For example, I helped structure and manage
the global licensing program for post mortem Thinking
Machines (aka TM Patents) and when that failed the
litigation tact against Big Blue and SGI.
-- My Japanese language and transactional experience
in Asia and Europe would suit me well to work on
behalf of clients seeking to initate and conclude
relationships abroad.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

Attached is my EPSC monthly legal report.  Thanks.

 

Chuck, the binder has been under review, but the policies you refer to are still in force.  Jim

Pursuant to the subject audit, AA has received copies of Policies F ("Selection and Retention of Outside Counsel") and Q ("Claims, Litigation and Related Proceedings") and related exhibits from the Enron Legal Department Policy Binder which was distributed in November 1994. While these policies appear to me to remain applicable and to be consistent with statements in the Enron Code of Ethics, AA was under the impression that either these particular legal department policies or the binder itself have been more recently reissued.

I am not aware of any later editions of the particular policies or the binder. Are either of you?

FYI

Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Dear General Counsels:

On Monday, May 21, 2001, our two summer associates, Chike Okpara and Reginald Sewell will begin their summer rotation program with Enron.

As you know, both of these gentlemen have just completed their first year of law school at the University of Texas School of Law.

Our summer program is for twelve-thirteen weeks beginning on May 21, 2001 and ending on August 17, 2001.  Since school begins on August 20, 2001, I anticipate that each student may wish to end his rotation during the week of August 13, 2001, thus leaving time for a brief vacation to be taken before school starts. 

Mr. Okpara's rotations are:

	May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001		Corp. Legal/ETS Legal Dept.
	
	June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001		Enron Global Finance Legal Dept.

	July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001		Enron Wholesale Services Legal Dept.

Mr. Sewell's rotations are:

	May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001		Enron Global Finance Legal Dept.

	June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001		Enron Broadband Services Legal Dept.

	July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001		Enron Energy Services Legal Dept.

Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell will attend New Hire Orientation on Monday, May 21, 2001.  I will be at New Hire Orientation to meet and greet them.  I will also present the Enron Code of Ethics.  New Hire Orientation ends at noon.  Following New Hire Orientation, I will take Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell to lunch.  I anticipate introducing them to their first respective rotations at 2:00 pm on Monday, May 21, 2001.

I have sent their resumes to you under separate cover.

Thanks so much for your participation in this program.

Please call me at 713-853-7224 if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Sharon

Kristina, please see the messages below and let me have your thoughts re either Michelle or David serving as the Chair or both serving as Co-Chairs.  Thank you. Jim

Hi, Jim.

We had a great group of people working on the CLE committee this year.  The committee was a combination of people identified by the various general counsels, plus people I knew and thought would be reliable volunteers.  I believe that one of the current committee members would be a logical choice to chair next year's law conference CLE program.  (I know that I would have felt a little more confident had I sat on the committee before taking the helm).

Although most of the committee members contributed to the effort, any of  the following lawyers would be strong candidates to chair next year's CLE committee:  Carlos Sole, Rose Engeldorf, Michelle Hicks, Susan Scott, Marianne Castano, Brenda Funk, or Kriste Sullivan.  David Koogler, who was not an active member of the committee, but nonetheless was responsible for a speaker, also would be a good choice (in fact, for some reason, EBS is under the impression that it is next on the list, so David and Michelle would not be surprised if they were tapped for the job -- co-chairs may be a good idea).

Let me know if you have any questions or would like any more information on the committee or other aspects of the law conference CLE program.

As I mentioned in my voice mail, I enjoyed chairing the committee and thank you for the opportunity.

Jim, I am so glad that the 2001 law conference went so well -- we have received many favorable comments from the attendees.  Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't.  It was very productive.

One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee.  Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning.  As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time.

So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor?  I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair.

Thanks so much for your help and input.

Please let me know how you would like me to respond.

Hi Jim,

As I mentioned in the elevator last week, we are trying to become more involved with Girls, Inc.  We would love for you and Carrin to sit at the Enron table at their Fifth Annual Luncheon on Tuesday, June 5th.  This event will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center at 12 p.m.  Please let me know if you're in town.  If you unfortunately can't attend, please let Carrin know that we would be honored for her to join us!  

Regarding SPA, I spoke with Toby Maddox a few weeks ago and he is completely on board with Enron's sponsorship of a performance by David Sedaris, a well-known satirist/author.  We supported this past spring's performance of the National Symphony of Spain at the $10,000 level, so we plan to maintain that level of support for the 2002 David Sedaris performance.  Toby and I discussed having a pre-performance cocktail reception for Enron employees and guests to meet Mr. Sedaris.  Please mark your calendar for April 17, 2002!

As always, I greatly appreciate your input.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
Thank you,  
Misha  	

Having now checked my calendar, I find that the legal PRC meeting is scheduled for June 5.  It is unlikely that I will be able to attend the lunch.

Dear Mr. Lay, 

My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards.  However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee. 

This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.   

If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions. 

I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue! 

The Trigger and Retaliation.    

Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge. 

I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following: 

-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work 
-        that I was making jobapplications by company email 

Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment. 

As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has: 

-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval. 

-        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results. 

-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further. 

Discrimination. 

It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.   

Hostile Working Environment. 

The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by "threats" rather than constructive comments.   

Wrongful Termination. 

Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time. 

I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case. 

Yours sincerely, 

Mingcheng Lian

Mark, we are already working.

The GISB working session was as exciting as you would expect it to be.  Most 
of the early termination and alternative damages provision concepts were 
hammered out.  A law firm (Shook & Shook) volunteered to draft language for 
the concepts agreed to in time for next Friday's committee meeting.  There 
was lot of discussion of what is going on in California and how the early 
termination process should work.  Enron should be fine with all of the 
concepts except the law firm was pushing an extremely broad set off right.  I 
don't think that is will go cross affiliates but it will go across 
contracts.  We will have to see the actual words.  I will attend the next 
meeting most likely by phone.  Hope things are going well.  See you in 13 
days.

Deirdre,

Given the credit quality of Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) no 
credit terms will need to be placed in the GISB.  

Russell

Russell - 

We are trying to get a 5 month sale in place with WEPCO - and Stacy Dickson 
said it would be possible to do the sale under a GISB if credit provisions 
were attached under the special provision section.  

The deal we are interested in is a 5,000/day sale at ANR/Alliance with a 
price of Nymex plus $0.14.  They would like the right to fix Nymex at any 
time.  What credit terms would you require (material adverse change, letter 
of credit) would you guys need?

Thanks -

We are meeting with our MSN contract negotiator tomorrow regarding this 
issue.  As of now, please do not sign up for SWB DSL service.  I will let you 
know tomorrow once the meeting is over.  Thanks for your patience.

Stacey, 

I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because 
their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me 
the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what 
ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for 
part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.

Thank you, 

Stacy Dickson Granmayeh

Dear MSN Internet Access Customer:

In an effort to help make your transition to another DSL Internet
provider a little easier, we have been working with Southwestern Bell
Internet Services and believe they may have a DSL Internet solution for
you.

Southwestern Bell Internet Services has a special offer for customers
affected by this transition with the following promotion:

Sign up for one-year and receive Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed
Internet Service for $49.95 per month with a free modem (after $99
rebate) and a free self-installation kit, along with no provisioning fees
($149 value).

If you prefer to not commit to a one-year term, you can still sign up for
Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed Internet Service on a month-to-month
basis for $49.95.

We have identified customers such as yourself who reside in the
Southwestern Bell service area and are recommending you contact them to
see if your telephone number and location qualifies for their DSL
Internet service.  You can contact Southwestern Bell on a special
toll-free number set up just for MSN customers, 1-800-962-5743. So,
hurry, this offer ends on April 30, 2001.

If you qualify, they have a group of specially trained support
representatives to assist you in making a smooth transition to
Southwestern Bell DSL Internet Service.

We hope this information is helpful and again, we apologize for this
situation and appreciate your patience.

Sincerely,
MSN HighSpeed - DSL Team

Gregg,

Per our conversation, attached is a revised draft Master Firm Purchase/Sale
Agreement between enovate and Oxy for your comment.  With respect to Mary's
last draft, I have changed Section 2.4 back to having enovate only sending
confirmations.  Other changes that were previously made by Mary were in
Section 2.3 which now allows either party can maintain recording equipment
and Section 8.2 which reinstated the original transfer language.

Let me know if you have other questions or changes to be made before it goes
back to OXY.  Thanks, Rich.

Hi Stacy,

Bridgette Anderson is currently briefing a new Enfolio Master Purchase Sale 
Firm with Cargill, but it is not an "Enfolio II".  It has provisions for 
collateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of attorney.

I know if it said "Enfolio II", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I 
believe it is good for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.  Also, 
what's the difference between the two contracts?  Is it just the collateral 
provisions and guaranty that make it different?  I'd attach a copy, but it 
hasn't been scanned yet.

Thanks,

I was very much looking forward to reviewing the protocol but to my 
disappointment it was not attached!

Russell, 

Because it covers swaps, a financial lawyer needs to look at it.  Even when 
the primary exposure is physical.

Stacy,
Attached is a draft guaranty from Gulf Resources to cover physical 
transactions between their sub, Crestar Energy Marketing and ENA.  Can you 
please review this format and provide your comments.  The guaranty covers 
purchase/sale and swap transactions, although our primary exposure is only 
physical natural gas.  I am not sure if one of the financial attorney's needs 
to look at this too

Thanks
Russell

**Randy, Take a look at the guaranty and the types of transactions we have 
with this counterparty to understand the need for the guaranty.

 

Russell:

I understand from Jeff McPhail of our marketing group that Enron is looking 
for
a parental guarantee from Gulf Canada for one of our subsidiaries - Crestar
Energy Marketing Corp.  (Jeff did not mention the subsidiary Enron was
requesting to have guaranteed).  I am enclosing a form of parental guarantee
that we have signed in the past.  Please review and call with any questions.

I do remember working on an assignment agreement regarding the assignment of 
It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals 
between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration.  ENA 
uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any 
length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board.  For firm deals 
that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one 
exists.  If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms 
and Conditions with our confirmation.  That answers your question of why 
Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place.

It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm 
agreement in place.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Stacy, 

The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place.? Thank you for the 
fax of the Columbia Energy GISB. 

Please note that we have a Transfer and Termination Agreement (dated January 
1, 2000), whereby certain Columbia Energy financial and purchase & sale 
Did our two companies enter into an assignment & novation agreement, or other 
similar document, specific to the Columbia Energy GISB? 

Also, please let me know what conclusion you and Ellen have reached in regard 
to the long-form/GTC issue.? I thank you for your help. 

Kind Regards,

I will have to look at the ICE agreement and see if we can add affiliates to 
the agreement.  Since the agreement was negotiated, if they cannot add us to 
the current agreement, then they should be able to submit a similar version 
for enovate to use.

Hi Monique,

Good catch.  I made the two changes.  Attached is a new red-lined version.  I 
am couriering over execution copies today.  Please call me if you have any 
questions.

Stacy

Attached please find the amendment to the enovate/Allegheny Energy Master 
Firm Agreement covering the credit provisions.  Please review and give me 
your comments.

After speaking with Rudwell about the credit amendment to the Master, I have 
made revisions to the attached document to reflect our conversation.  
Basically, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC is an independently rated 
entity.  As such, we will not be receiving a Parent Guarantee on their 
behalf.  I think I have removed the references to the parent guarantee, but 
can you please review the attached to make sure I did not miss anything.  

Rudwell - If I mistated anything, please let us know.

following comments:
Transaction Agreement #1
1 - MaxDQ should be 20,346
2 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payment equal to $0.15 plus 1.7% x Spot Price rather 
than $0.017 x Spot Price

Transaction Agreement #2
1 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payments consistent with Transaction Agreement #1 rather 
than $0.20 and $0.25

I think these are all fine, but I wanted to run them by you.  I have made the

As per our conversation, attached is Constellation Power's comments to the 
Master Firm agreement they received from 
Roy Rodriguez.  I will be happy if you can review this.  Additionally, as 
soon as I come to some agreement with their credit group regarding threshold 
and MACs, I will draft a credit worksheet and forward same to you.

Thanks
Rudwell. 

Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of
the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is
the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC.

The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent
with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to
enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and
discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put
closure to this agreement in the very near future.

Hey.  I've been so busy.  Most of May was a whirlwind.  John's sister,
Lynn, got married two weekends ago.  Then, we went on vacation for the past
week to Kiahwah.  Oh, and I switched jobs.   I am now the Managing Director
of our internal trading platform.  I miss Jennifer, she was really great to
work with.  Such a nice person.

How have you been?  How is Merideth?  I took a cute picture of her sleeping
from when you were over and she had tired herself out from crying (hee,
hee).  Anything else new with you?  Paige had her baby.  A little boy named
William after his pop.  She has taken to motherhood and absolutely loves
it.  She's even talking about #2 already.  She's always been a kind of
crazy that way!

Call me when you get a chance.  I still have the same work number
(713-207-1341) and John is out traveling all week so I have time to chat at
night, too (713-432-0470).  Not that I wouldn't have time to chat if he was
around!

Talk to you soon!

Attached is a clean version and a redlined version of the above-referenced 
document which incorporates the changes that we discussed with the exception 
of the end of Section 4.2, Section 4.5 and Section 4.6.  That language was 
added based on what our credit department wants.  Please review and call me 
with any comments (713) 853-5705.

Thanks, 

Stacy

My 2-4 conference call tomorrow just got canceled.

Heather,

I am glad to hear you (and your car) are o.k.  We did not have any problems.  
Those pictures are amazing!  The video of I-10 was unbelievable.  Dan and 
Marianne went to I-10 and saw the flooding in person.  He said the video on 
tv did not really show how bad it was.  Is there an estimate on when B  & P 
will be back in their offices?  It would be nice for you to have a couple of 
days off.

Stacy

P.S. I heard that Monica Jordan Richards left Enron and went to Entergy.

Gregg, 

As we discussed... I would add the following provision at the end of the 
second sentence in Section VIII A. (3):

;provided however, in the event that Seller's invoice to Buyer is delayed due 
to Buyer not providing Seller the ANR information in the time period 
specified in Section V (2), the due date for payment of the Demand Charge

Susan,

I left a message last week for Brenda Frankenhauser about the Columbia 
assignment.  She has not returned my call.

Stacy

Susan, 

Please use the new master instead of the old GISB.

Stacy

Thanks for the info.

Yes.

Donna:
 
Jeff Hodge asked that I respond to your e-mail.  

ENA does use the GISB contract to conduct its "spot" business.  By "spot", I 
mean interruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or less 
in duration.  Enron also has its own form of spot agreement that we use.  I 
have attached a copy of that agreement.

We do try to negotiate some special provisions into each GISB.  Our current 
version of the special provisions is included in the GISB agreement that is 
attached.  I do not know of any company that uses the GISB as-is.

We do not use the GISB for firm deals that are greater than one month in 
duration.  For those deals, we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement that I have attached.

If you need copies of actual confirmations, Bob Bowen or Ellen Wallumrod 
would be able to give you examples.  Form confirmations are at the back of 
each of the agreements attached.

If you need additional information, please let me know.

Gregg, 

Attached are my suggested changes to the above-referenced confidentiality

we discussed.  A few of the changes are simply clean-up.  Please let me know 
if you have any questions.

Thanks

schedule.

We can do that.  It is up to the trader and the scheduler.

Cary,  

I have reviewed Mary's comments on the Nipsco contract.  She makes some good 
points and it would be nice for Nipsco to make those changes.  If Nipsco will 
not make the changes, I still think it is acceptable for enovate to sign the 
agreement.

Stacy

Mark, 

Jeff asked that I review TradeSpark.  All I could find for product 
descriptions were abbreviations of products that were not very clear.  If

let me know how to find them so that I can review them.

Earlier this month I notified each of you of a request by Enron traders to

overcame these so that we had available a computer terminal (located outside 
of Sandi Braband's office) for review of product descriptions.  I am 
proceeding with negotiation of the access agreement and need to assess the 
status of the product description reviews.

Please let me know where each of you stand in relation to your product

checked my files this morning and we have nothing.  We also find nothing in

a copy of the documentation, we will be happy to prepare the agreement for 
you today and fax to the customer.  Thanks.

Could you look in your database of confirmation letters, and see if you can 
find one for B & J Gas & Oil, c/o Bowie, Inc., P.O. Box 1430, Clarksburg, WV  
26302?  It would have been for 10,000/month on CNG for the period 3/1/2000

you on 3/3/2000, and you were going to fax a copy to Bowie and to Robert 
Cawthon with B & J Gas and Oil.  I need a copy of that confirmatio, as well 
as the documentation on when it was sent out to them.

Ed and Mark, 

As we discussed, I spoke to Jeff Hodge and Travis McCullough about the best 
way to document this deal.  We all agreed that it is better to document the 
deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan.  
Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in 
fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and 
lenders.  The protections  and remedies afforded by the Master track those 
that Enron would have under a loan document.  Enron would be in no better 
position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document 
than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Additionally, I assume 
that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document 
this deal as a loan.

Please let me know if you need additional information on this topic.

Please replace both references to "the Southern District of Texas"  with "the 
District of Columbia" in the arbitration provision.  Please let me know if 
this does not work for you. 

Stacy

Here is the latest version of the above-referenced agreement.

Gregg and Steve, 

I think that we should add the phrase "or any increases to the MTV as a 
result of Buyer's Deficiency Quantity"  that you added in Nicor.  I left a 
message for the Coral attorney this morning.  I am planning on telling him 
about the addition of the phrase when he calls.

Stacy

	Gregg Penman@ENRON
	04/02/2001 10:49 AM
		 
Stacy - one quick question regarding the Coral Transaction Agreements, is it 
your interpretation that the fuel charge, 1.7%, would also apply to the 
credits to the MTV resulting from our non-perfomance?  We tried to make that 
more specific under the Nicor agreement.  Steve has discussed the concept 
with Coral and they seem to be fine with it.  However, Coral's only change to 
the fuel charge language was including the term "sold".  Do you think this is 
sufficient, or should we be more specific?

Thanks - Gregg

Gregg, 

I have three minor changes to the agreement.  I have attached a red-line 
version reflecting my changes.

Stacy

	Gregg Penman@ENRON
	03/27/2001 09:46 AM
		 
One more for the pile.  IDACORP has requested that 100% of the guaranty they 
receive on behalf of enovate to be issued by Peoples.  Peoples has prepared 
the attached reimbursement agreement which would obligate ENA to 50% of any 
payments made by Peoples under their guaranty.  We have issued several of 
these, going both directions.  Jeff is familiar with the concept if you have 
any questions.  Can you please review the reimbursement agreement, and if 
acceptable, prepare execution copies with initials?  This has a lower level 
of priority than the storage deals with Nicor and Coral which begin April 1.  

Any questions or comments, please let me know.

The specific sections we need to include are as follows:

Article III
 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6

Article IV
 4.2, 4.10, 4.11

Article V
 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.9, 5.10, 

Article VI
 6.1, 6.1a, 6.1b

Articel VII
 All 
  

To prepare the confirmation for this deal, we need to make a few changes to 
the standard form:

1. Incorporate the revolver document  Articles 3-7 by reference that I 
forwarded earlier.  I think this is the easiest way. We will need to make the 
appropriate modifications to change for our transaction type. Laura Falk at 
the company should be able to provide us with whatever information we need 
(name of agreement, parties to, etc). She can be reached at 908-719-4242.  
Since NUI must already comply with all of this for the bank, it should not be 
too burdensome for them.  If they push back, I have marked the specific 
sections that we need to include at a minimum.

2. We need to delete the reference to the collateral threshold and 
requirement to post performance assurance in the Master.

3. Do we need to do anything about the fact that in some cases we have 
redundant and perhaps conflicting defaults/remedies?  Or can we just state 
that anything we incorpoarate from the revolver document supercedes the 
Master, if applicable?

Can you think of anything else that I am missing?

Mark, please send me the updated model.

Call me if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Stacy,

See attached.  We do have an executed ISDA with NUI Energy Brokers, Inc.  
Also, there is Draft language in the header and footer that you may want to 
take out.

Thanks,
Joe

Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  I will not send it 
to Paul until you tell me to.

Melba, 
I do not know what "any Unrestricted Algonquin Gas Transmission City Gate" 
means.  This description needs more detail explaining "unrestricted".

Here are the confirms that Joe prepared.

Sara, 

Here is the physical confirmation for the NUI deal.  I added an Event of 
Default under the Credit Agreement as an additional Triggering Event under 
the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.

Daniel,

I found a GISB between Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. and Enron North 
America Corp. dated  July 1, 1998 in our files.  ENA received the contract 
from an assignment from Columbia Energy Marketing Corporation.  Why do we 
need to negotiate and execute another GISB agreement?

Good morning, Stacy.
 I have reviewed the Guaranty forwarded last evening by Rudwell
Johnson.  He requested that I get back to you with comments.  Please note my
changes on the attached.  As Rudwell suggested, in the second paragraph  I
have included language that limits this Guaranty to the two transactions
that we working on.  In the same vein, I have also included language (see
paragraph 17) that ensures that any other guarantees will not be cumulative
with this one.  I assume that we will do a separate guaranty to use as
Exhibit D to the Master Purchase Agreement.  Any questions, please call me
at 908-719-4228.

You'll need to fill out the following info for the Global Counterparty group 
in order to get NUI Utilities Inc. set up.  If you don't have access to this 
Lotus Notes database, please let me know and I can fill out the info for you.

Just let me know!

SBR x30569

I think this would solve a lot of our problems.
 

Mark, 
In the course of two conversations with Paul Chymiy, he identified 5 credit 
issues.  They are:

1) The Credit Agreement is for a term of 364 days so it terminates on 
12/21/01.  They will enter into a new credit agreement but not on identical 
terms and not necessarily with the same lenders.

2) NUI Corp. does not have credit rating since the reorganization.  The 
credit rating should be tied to NUI Utilities.

3) The MAC should be BBB instead of BBB- for Customer.

4) NUI Utilities no longer owns the common stock of Elizabethtown and City 
Gas.  They are now divisions of NUI Utilities.

5)  The treasurer will not agree to (xiii) in Section 5 of the Transaction 
Agreement concerning additional debt.

Stacy   

Diane, 

I would wait on sending the confirms because we are currently negotiating 
with NUI on the provisions that Sara added.  NUI has told us that those 
provisions are unacceptable in the physical deal so I assume they will be 
unacceptable in the financial deal.  Hopefully, this issue will be resolved 
tomorrow.  I will let you know the outcome.

Stacy: Friday I got a call from Evan King (Attorney for B & J Gas and Oil) 
regarding a payment. They think that index is the price and we have proof 
that the price was fixed. Proof that the price was fixed is included in the 
email Jim Javins sent me. Please review and get with the attorney to help 
resolve the dispute  (Evan King 304 624 8000). If you have any questions 
please call me at ext 37699. Thanks, Brad

Brad:

I got your message late Friday.  The B & J Gas and Oil deal was done on 
2/10/2000 for 10,000 a month @ $2.70 for one year (March, 2000 - February 28, 
2001).  The confirmation was sent in care of Bowie, Inc., another of our 
customers from whom he had purchased this production, and who received his 
revenue and did his distributions at the time.  I got another copy from Stacy 
Dickson, ENA attorney, last week and faxed it to Bowie to review with Cawthon.

This was not paid correctly by the payables department, and was paid at the 
index instead of the fixed price.  We sent the deal ticket to Wade Price the 
day the deal was done, but it was not paid correctly.  This causes these 
kinds of problems.

I am attaching some notes from my phone log where I had discussions with B & 
J (Cawthon) and Bowie at the time I locked him in, as well as conversations 
later in March when he said he had not received his confirmation (it was sent 
again).  Call me if you need anything further.

Long time since I placed one of these to you. . . 

Okay, 
NORTHEAST GAS MARKETS, LLC; An EOL approved CP (Investment Grade); We have 
have a new GISB [Choice of Law = NY] & a Special provision (13.10) that I 
haven't come across yet whereas  - - - - - -  Enron recognizes that NEGM is 
acting as buyer on behalf of certain companies ("Repurchasers") to who it 
immediately resells such gas at the Delivery  Points, The Parties further 
agree that the term "transporter" shall include any company acting in the 
capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser & agree that 4.3 will apply to 
invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received. - - - - - I 
can't see any reasons why this should cause this GISB to be excluded from EOL 
transactions, but wanted to make sure that there wasn't some deeper intent 
for the special provision that we would want to keep On-line transactions on 
GTCs.

Anything we should beware of?

Gee, almost feels just like old times. :o)

Thanks!

Per my voice mail.

Per our conversation.  

Please review the Coral Transaction Agreements and give me your comments.

Stacy

Gregg,

If you have not already done so, I would run this deal by credit and see what 
provisions they want included.

Stacy

Gregg, 

My thoughts on Allegheny's changes to the Master are similar to Mary's.  I am 
generally fine with the changes except 1) I would counter with lowering the 
liquidated damages to 10 cents (ultimately, this is a business decision)  and 
2) I would tell them that we need arbitration.  In some respects, it is more 
likely that disputes would arise under this type of deal so it is even more 
important to have arbitration. Please let me know if you want me to talk to 
anyone at Allegheny about their changes.

 Attached, for your review, are my comments on Allegheny' proposed

not oppose any of the changes, but there are at least two items that I
consider business decisions.

Per our conversation.

Paul, 

Attached is the most recent versions of the above-referenced agreements which 
incorporates the changes you negotiated with our Credit Department.  There 
was one additional change to the Master Agreement to Section 4.2(ix).  I have 
also attached the letter agreement which cancels the physical gas deals for 
April.  Please review and give me your comments.

Stacy

Your brain is working correctly.  I think that we should seek out and 
destroy  every old Seagull contract.  If we are doing business under any of 
them, we need to get new cotnracts in place.

Stacy

Jennifer, 

What a cutie!  Meg is adorable and so grown up now!  She should start talking 
before long if she has not already.  I'm sure that you are teaching her to 
say Stacy.  I hope you guys are doing well.  I understand Mr Espey is not 
doing as well as hoped.  That must be particularly difficult for you guys 
since you are not near by.

When do you think that you will be in Houston again?  We miss you guys.  We 
got used to your being around last year.

Meredith is doing well.  She is starting to sit well on her own.  She still 
does an occasional face-plant though.  It really makes her mad when she 
does.  She loves her exersaucer.  We went to Arkansas for Easter so Meredith 
had her first plane ride.  She did very well.  I can't imagine entertaining a 
baby for five hours on a plane like you do!  Meredith has not mastered cereal 
yet.  We only feed her twice a week which does not help.  We keep joking that 
she will still be on formula when she goes to kindergarden!

I will send some picutures of Meredith soon.

Number 3 concerns the swap piece of this deal.

 I though it might be helpful to review where we stand on the various
agreements:

 1. Enfolio Agreement between NUI Utilities and ENA - The version
(including all Exhibits) that Stacy sent on April 11 (5:23 p.m.) is the
final and is acceptable.  I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's Notice
Information (Exhibit A) to Stacy.  Stacy, upon receipt, can you please
generate the final agreement?
 2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 with
Bob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow.
 3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter should
be addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed the
Confirmation).  Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI Confirmation
Nos. 31060 and 46669.
 3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version of
the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review.
As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be the
Guarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make it
clear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enron
had agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for the
Enfolio Agreement.  I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am not
satisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limit
the scope of the Guaranty is sufficient.  I think the limitations need to be
set forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If acceptable,
the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for
Swap V09140.5.
 <<ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc>>

 - ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc

Sounds good.  I will look for the overnight.

Paul, 

Attached is the final version of the Master Firm Agreement which incorporates 
NUI's notice information and all previously discussed changes.  Also, 
attached is the April Transaction Confirmation Letter with the change to the 
addressee.  The Exhibits for the letter are the NUI Confirmations Nos. 31060 
and 46669.  I understand that the changes that you requested to the swap 
guaranty are acceptable and that you will receive revised agreements 
shortly.  Please let me know if there is anything else outstanding.

Stacy

Stacey, 

I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because 
their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me 
the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what 
ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for 
part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.

Thank you,

Dear MSN Internet Access Customer:

In an effort to help make your transition to another DSL Internet
provider a little easier, we have been working with Southwestern Bell
Internet Services and believe they may have a DSL Internet solution for
you.

Southwestern Bell Internet Services has a special offer for customers
affected by this transition with the following promotion:

Sign up for one-year and receive Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed
Internet Service for $49.95 per month with a free modem (after $99
rebate) and a free self-installation kit, along with no provisioning fees
($149 value).

If you prefer to not commit to a one-year term, you can still sign up for
Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed Internet Service on a month-to-month
basis for $49.95.

We have identified customers such as yourself who reside in the
Southwestern Bell service area and are recommending you contact them to
see if your telephone number and location qualifies for their DSL
Internet service.? You can contact Southwestern Bell on a special
toll-free number set up just for MSN customers, 1-800-962-5743. So,
hurry, this offer ends on April 30, 2001.

If you qualify, they have a group of specially trained support
representatives to assist you in making a smooth transition to
Southwestern Bell DSL Internet Service.

We hope this information is helpful and again, we apologize for this
situation and appreciate your patience.

Sincerely,
MSN HighSpeed - DSL Team

In the morning could you please call to Omaha and ask who could print out enough copies of the attached presentation for the attendees of the 9:00 meeting and forward this to them?

Thanks Audrey! 

 

I believe what Lisa (Sawyer?) was referring to is the termination of TW's shared cost surcharge effective October 31, 2001.  I don't think there would be any system changes required.  Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.  If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.

Elizabeth,  Is this correct?  I know you're on a project, please let me know if you can check this or who can.

Thank you!
Lindy

Lisa brought up a TW change effective Nov 1.  It involves eliminating a turnback surcharge.  I have no other information, but you might check with the business folks for any system changes required.

The note "need to verify" appears on this slide, after the bullet "110,000 MMcfd annual average increase".

I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet "CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their "California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.

You are correct.  I've got my units confused - the amount on slide #11 should be 110 MMcfd.  

On the San Juan slide #14, I've left out a phrase from the report.  The report reads " total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 22%,  about 2.4% per year, to 3.4 Bcf/cd by 2010".  In the tabular information of the study, 1999 begins with 4,306 MMcf/d and 2010 ends with 3,351 MMcf/d.

My question on slide 11 may be an issue of units.  If the increase is from 6400 MMcfd to 7500 MMcfd, should the increase amount be 110 MMcfd vs 110000MMcfd?

Separately, on slide 14, can you tell me how the 2.4% decline is calculated?  If it is based on the 4.3 Bcfd down to 3.5 Bcfd shouldn't it be a 1.8% decline?

Thanks,

Michael

The note "need to verify" appears on this slide, after the bullet "110,000 MMcfd annual average increase".

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.

I talked with Steve about this bullet.  Let's insert the phrase "...due to capitalizing on market volatility."

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?

I would recommend the following assumptions for capacity resubscription fro=
m now through Q3 2006:

The historical average rates should be assumed for the resubscription of Ea=
st and Ignacio to Blanco capacity rolling-off during this time period.  The=
 forward curves that have been discussed represent the value of capacity to=
 California, not East to East or Ignacio to Blanco capacity.  I don't think=
 that max rates for the capacity represented in these groups is appropriate=
.

The max rate at $.1020 is appropriate for the San Juan group.

The appropriate max rate for the West group is $.2868.

The volume of Ignacio to Blanco capacity available for resubscription shoul=
d be reduced.  Today, we have contracts from Ignacio to the Blanco Hub that=
 then continue on Transwestern on another contract.  (These contracts exist=
ed before Transwestern owned this line and were assigned to Transwestern wh=
en we purchased the facilities from NWPL.)  Because of this "artificial bre=
ak" in the contracts, Transwestern is collecting the San Juan lateral rate =
once on a contract from Ignacio to Blanco and then again on another contrac=
t from Blanco to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  In the future, when this c=
apacity is resubscribed, the contracts will most likely not be split at the=
 Blanco Hub and Transwestern will only extract the San Juan lateral rate on=
ce from Ignacio to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  Jan and I will look at t=
he Ignacio capacity that has historically continued on Transwestern south o=
f the Blanco Hub (vs. delivering to El Paso at Blanco).  We will come up wi=
th a % to be applied to the Ignacio to Blanco capacity that should be resub=
scribed at a zero rate (or the capacity to be resubscribed can be reduced -=
 whichever is easier to put in the model).

Attached is the spreadsheet updated for the I to I deals.  Please see the first tab for summarized info.  

I took vacation (8) on February 1st.

Don't forget to submit your time reports by Thursday morning.

It's showing the percentage of capacity subscribed vs. total capacity.

On slide 28 the graph is a percent of what?  Is it revenue or something else?

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?

The fuel assumptions to be backed-out of the spread should be:

	2002 - 2006	San Juan to CA		4.75%
	2002 - 2006	Permian to CA		5.00%
	2007 - on	San Juan to CA		2.50%
	2007 - on	Permian to CA		2.50%

Kevin, Tracy, Steve, Paul - Let me know if you think these are not the right assumptions.

This morning in our meeting, we discussed 3 cases to be run in the TW 2010 model.  I've summarized them in the attached spreadsheet so we can keep track of our variables.  I will be sending you additional info for the various cases.  Please call to discuss.

Thanks Mary Kay!

The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

Here's the spreadsheet with numbers for the 3 cases.  Please refer to the Assumptions tab (updated numbers in the Summary, Fuel Price & Rates tabs).

 

Yipee!

Attached is the preliminary January California monthly report for your review...our last one, yeah!!!

TK - Please review/verify the rates that I have highlighted in pink.

I have already spoken with Terry regarding 3 days where I noticed discrepancies between total scheduled in TMS vs website posting and have determined the correct number to report.  All other data looks very similar to previous reports filed.

Please provide any comments or updates that may be necessary by COB February 22nd.

What is the status of the draft from Gina Taylor's group?  Will they be sending it to me for review?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.

I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?

I did not have the updated model so I could not add assumptions from there, projected revenue growth, financial data, etc.  I need to get Michael or Davis to add.    I realize there is quite a bit of work to be done as far as putting this into a narrative format.  Hopefully this will start the process.  I think Lindy is the best person to help with this while I am out.  Thursday is probably the first day I will feel like looking at this.  I realize the timing is not great for my surgery, however, is there really ever a good time.  I actually planned this over a month ago.  

 << File: BUSINESS PLAN OF TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY.doc >> 

I've attached Michael's most recent version (from Friday) of the PowerPoint presentation I put together and I've incorporated Tracy's comments (from yesterday).  Ron Matthews had drafted a history for Tracy - it appears on a slide in the presentation.

This is all we have as far as a basic overview and history.

   

If you could help me with a couple of pieces we will be moving in the right direction.     I am looking for a history of TW and some basic overview stuff.

Attached is redlined draft.  Plese see changes to the History and Customers & Contracts sections requested.

 

Here is the summary of the expansions currently included in the 10 year projection.I received from James.

The projects in the lastest copy of the evaluation model are outlined in the attached file.

 

Please sign me up for the Monday March 18th session at 1:30.  Will you be sending the location?

The new TW Contract/Capacity Release system is due to be implemented the weekend of March 9, 2002.  We will be offering training/demo's of the new system for internal users on the below dates.  Please contact Alma Carrillo with the date and time you would like to attend.  

Thanks

Linda

Monday March 18th:  Two Sessions - 1:30pm and 3:00pm

Thursday March 21st:  One Session - 1:30pm

If you have any questions or will be unable to attend one of the above demo sessions please let me know.

What is the question?

?????

You can change the assumption on the assumptions page. The issue is that lindy didn't build in fuel retention in the average rate. I would think that you should. 
Hdt

I think Rich has told you that I spoke with him yesterday and would like to discuss what it would take to get a new IOS system up and running for TW.  Please give me a call or e:mail me to schedule a meeting to discuss.  I'm at 36007.

Thanks,
Lindy

Sorry, I didn't see the questions below.

We were using historical rates (no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales) through 2006.  After 2006, I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates (assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate) and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate.  Davis and I discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate, so Davis said he would use the max rate after 2006.  (All of this is just pertaining to the West rates.)

The historical average West rate is $.2565.  The historical West rate with fuel adjustment added is $.3404.  The max rate is $.2868.

It's the same thing someone commented below (in blue) in response to the question - "if we are at average rates we would be able to get it  back (fuel over-retention) up to the max rate number."

see below for question

I thought we were using the average rates for resubscription with an adjustment for fuel because the historical rates assumed a 5% over collection. 

Attached is the model incorporating the changes.
1)	have implemented 50% undivided interest concept
2)	Cash flow detail is as follows:
a.	85mm in operating cash flow
b.	18mm net from release of ENE receivable/payable
c.	137.5mm equity infusion
d.	(137.5mm) debt repayment
e.	85mm in new debt (to bring debt to target levels)
f.	185mm equity dividend (to bring equity to target levels)
3)	I've used the income detail tab to ratio taxes appropriately
4)	I've made reg amort $6.8mm per Bob.  Regulatory asset remains on books thru 2011.
5)	?
6)	Not including interest expense, proforma ROE is in the 12.5% to 13.5% range.  Rod, debt capital was not invested in a project with returns exceeding cost of debt, therefore ROE dropped with leverage.  Agreed, this is backwards from intuitive result.
Davis

 << File: TW.model.r0.8d.xls >> 

See below		

Jim:   see # 4
	
Please see comments below:

1) We should probably show TransPecos as an undivided ownership interest as opposed to an investment in JV.  That way, the revenues and costs will be picked up above the line and can be analyzed with the other revenues.  Looks like we are properly picking up the capex from TransPecos in our capex additions already.  
I might be missing something, but I only see two accounting ways to handle TransPecos - equity method investment (as shown), or consolidated with 50% minority interests.  In the former case our debt holdings are understated, and in the latter they're overstated.  My guess is that the JV will be accounted for as shown.  In terms of capex, currently I have TW picking up 50% of the capex (starting equity basis).  Not to be flip, but I'm not sure which accounting method would let us pick up half the revenues and half the costs.  If we had an undivided interest we would have 50% of the deal on our books, debt and all.

Please let me know which method I should use. 

2) The equity balance did not seem to change for the $137,500,000 equity infusion.     Was this treated as equity in to repay or just an extinguishment? 
There was $184mm in excess cash that was dividended back out.  The model had to increase borrowings and pay a dividend to get the debt/equity ratio to 50% after the infusion.   It would seem to me that if there was 137,500,000 coming in that it needed to be paid to reduce the corresponding debt, so where did the excess cash come from?
 
3) Let's grow Other Taxes by 1%   Should grow by the same percentage as either revenues or net plant.   For most pipes these are property/earnings dependent and are derived from the uitlity operating income line on the form 2 for the most part.
I need to fix the model to make "other taxes" a function of ppe.  I'll make it a constant rate based on year 1.  Rod reminds me that part of that is probably gross receipts - I'll go back to the  planning models and try to figure out a relative proportion.    Also a part is payroll taxes.    Tracy could probably break it apart for you.

4) Question for TG, Reg Am was only $7.6 million in 2002 but $16.5 million going forward.   All Reg Am should disappear with the new rate case. 
that's why we had to increase it so much - so that it amortizes to zero by 2006.  Note that it is non-cash, non-tax, but it represents a large reduction in equity.    Then there must be a problem elsewhere, since it is supposed to be gone by itself.

5) Question for LD/SH on the 2006 drop in revenues by approx. $15 million.  Detail schedules show why, just want to make sure it makes sense.
That's an item that Lindy's following up on, but probably the whole group needs to consider.  Our fuel retention goes away after '06, the question is whether "max rates" should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not.  The interpretation in the model is that "max rates" means our max published reservation fee only, meaning that we lose $15mm of fuel retention after '06.    If we are at max rates, then that would be the result, however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number.

6) ROE questions/cases -

	Let's show after ROE, the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov. 2001.  This obviously dropped the ROE from 12-13% to 10%.  If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW (it should not have been there in the first place!), the ROE will be much higher.  In addition, reducing equity by the $137,500,000 should also improve the ROE substantially.    ?
I'll run a line that adds back tax-adjusted interest expense in the ROE calc, the $137.5mm was handled as above.   This is not intuitive.   The ROE should be bigger with debt, unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt.     Debt up, equity down, ROE up?

It's just one slide.  The 2nd bullet is true in the recent past, but not necessarily going forward.  I'd have to check with Jan tomorrow if the 4th bullet is in the ballpark.  Neither of these bullets represent a timeframe - Gina said this is very high level.  I guess the last bullet kind of sums up our caveat.  Let me know if you have comments.  Gina said she had been running this all past Rod.

Original Message-----
  

Tracy had suggested that we leave the Marketing Strategy to the end after we put together the 10 year plan so that we could address how we plan to meet it.  I had included in my drafts to Kevin the Mktg Strategy slides (2) from our 2002 stuff, but we probably need to expand that to address expansions etc, but I was waiting until we finalized what we were going to project in the 10 year plan.  The strategy should be the same for the Rating Agency slide bullets as for the Business Plan Text.

Lindy, what is the marketing strategy section Kevin is talking about.
Hopefully I got it right this time.  We still  need to get the Selected Financial Data and the marketing strategy put  together.  Thank you all for helping on this.  Rod, I will leave it to  you as to whether or not you want to send to Stan as a first draft.

Did you have any comments?  Want anything changed/added/deleted?

Jan,
	I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001?

Jan, 
	What percentage of our revenues from from demand charges in 2001?  Gina has a bullet here that says "over 90%".  Is this in the ballpark?

  

I have 1.8 Bcf/d for annual daily average for total system in 2001 on TW. 

I'll take an estimate for TW througput per day.  I need something in the next hour, if possible.

Thanks for immediate attention....Gina

Gina, I am waiting for Steve to respond to two e:mails I've sent him requesting comments on the slide.  He is in Dallas today.

Thanks!  Should I call an estimate or is this actual?  Also, any changes on the slide I sent yesterday?

Sorry!  Here are the bullets: 
- 2,500 mile pipeline extending from west Texas to the California border with 1.7 Bcf/day of peak capacity
- Maximum Rate Environment Due to Increased California Demand
- Bi-Directional Flow Capabilities Provides Flexibility to Rapidly Adapt Regional Demand
- Over 90% of Revenues From Demand Charges
- Western Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2005, Eastern Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2002; Well-Positioned for Recontracting
- No New Rate Case Until November 2006
- Overbuilding into Cal. can compromise resubscription of contracts (not unique to TW)

The slide includes these bullets, a map of TW and a barchart with 1999-2001 throughput.  I asked Gina to change the 90% to 80% in 4th bullet.  How do you feel about the "Maximum Rate Environment ..." bullet?

I have no way of seeing the slide on my Blackberry. Do you want to fax it to my hotel. I can look at it tonight.

I am planning to take take vacation days on March 8 & 11 and on March 29 & April 1.  Please let me know if there are any scheduling conflicts.

Thanks,
Lindy

Hello!  I was asleep at the wheel there.  I'll have Gina change that to 85% subscribed on average through 2005.  

There is not time period referenced on the max rate statement.

What period does the max rate assumption cover. The comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted West thru 2005. That is not true.

Gina needed to finalize, so we deleted the "max rate environment" bullet.

What period does the max rate assumption cover. The comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted West thru 2005. That is not true.

This is my understanding too.  We can discount GRI away and we only have to pay the Gas Research Institute what we collect.  We have to pay the ACA, if we discount it away.

One more check would be Jeanette Doll.  Jeanette?

The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay.  We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute.  The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.

Lindy

Did I state this correctly.  Please let Eric and me know if I miss stated anything.

James,

On Sun Devil, are we required to collect GRI, ACA, or any other surcharges?  If so, how are they applied?  If not, why?

I tried to find the original spreadsheet that I'm sure you sent me where you calculated these quarterly rates, but I can't find it.  Do you recall these rates?  My question is, I think we used just demand dollars (so I don't think commodity is in here) - how is it that the San Juan rates are above the maximum $.1020?  There really aren't any surcharges for San Juan to Thoreau transactions.  Can you try to look at this to see why the rate might be averaging greater than max?

Thanks!!

I am here.  Let me know when you have time to meet today.  So far I'm open.

Lindy,

Just wanted to let you know that we have started working on the TW contract and capacity release system.  I believe there will be a kick-off meeting sometime next week which you will be invited to attend.  We are due to implement on January 14th which gives us very little time to get everything we need to get accomplished so I will be calling and asking you alot of questions in the next month or two.  I'd like to try and get together with you soon on two items, inside/outside the path and flow direction.  I will be out on vacation next week.  If you have time on Friday that would be great, otherwise could we talk by phone next week?  Please let me know.  Thanks

Linda

How does this look?  The first slide is the flyer to be distributed to the parents in the kids' bags.  The second slide I'll print to put on a large manila envelope for the each classroom door.

Did I forget any info?  Does it sound voluntary enough?

Let me know your comments and I'll run it past someone in the office this evening or on Monday and try to have the envelopes out on Monday.  I'll collect the checks each evening when I pick-up Sam.

Thanks,
Lindy

 

Okay.  I've already drafted some Marketing Strategy stuff that Steve's reviewing.  Let me know when you want to get together to discuss.

Lindy:
The next parts that we will need some help on in the TW business plan is -

1) Risks - contract rolloffs and competitive threats
2) Growth opportunities (e.g. TransPecos, Sun Devil and the Bakersfield projects)
3) Marketing strategy

I have attached an updated Business Plan. Please insert your thoughts in the appropriate section - it may be helpful to talk about it first!
Thanks,

Kevin

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

That's probably a good idea.  I'll wait until I get our comments.

Do we need to run this by SoCal?

Can you help me with addressing some of these issues?  Let's talk after Staff Mtg.

Thanks!

1. Is the Marketing selling this point as Primary?
2. Shippers would need to adjust their Primary points around on their contracts. If Allocating West of Thoreau.
3. It might encourage LFT if West of Thoreau capacity not full.
4. It might encourage more Back Hauls from various points in the West of Thorea Area.
5. Could we sell Primary to Primary if Receipted West of Thoreau?

FYI,
	Looks like we have a few adm things to get in place before we can implement.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

Thanks again Jan!

I'll have to research the contract.  I'll try to get back with you today.

Lindy.

While testing the TMS nomination and scheduling processes that Interface into the new CMS system, I have found a TW Firm contract with Southern Energy Inc. # 26719 that was set up back in May or June of 2000 which has several alt. receipt templates that are outside the primary path. The primay path for this contract is San Juan Bloomfield receipts to Socal Needles as primary delivery. It shows up in production with alt. receipt groups in Central, West Texas, and Panhandle. Is this correct?

Thanks Ramona

I think we can get with Ramona and Mary Draemer to discuss.  They may just be able to work it through their contacts at SoCal.  I do think we will want to run the posting past SoCal before we put it out there.

Lindy - Do you know the answers to Ramona's ?s or should we call SoCal to discuss?

I had been meaning to reply to your message you sent to Tony & me a few weeks ago, after you showed us the houses on Winter Wheat.  I saw this morning that 66 Winter Wheat had an option pending =(   I love that house!  But, we are not in a position yet to make a decision about moving, so I guess it wasn't meant to be.

I just wanted to let you know that we appreciated you coming out to show us some homes the other weekend and following-up so promptly with your e:mail on other houses.  If we do decide that we're coming to the Woodlands, we will be calling you to look for a house.  We really enjoyed meeting you and think that it would be great to work with you to look for a home.

Thank you!
Lindy

It is my understanding (from Kevin Hyatt) that its like Arizona's PUC.

Pie chart slide for AZ,NM, and NEV shows the source of info to be thr "Arizona Corporation Commission". Who is this?

Good Luck!

Thanks - that's what I was hoping it was. Heading in to see Moodys. Thanks again for your help.

I wasn't at this meeting (I was out yesterday).

Ramona,
The meeting requested today was not about the Topock point but about the Socal Window, even though the conversation did migrate to the Topock issue. 
I will come by and update you on what Lorraine spoke about so let me know when you will be available, I will also include you on any future meetings.

John Buchanan

Lindy & John,
I understand that marketing had a meeting on this issue today with the Gas Logistics team. Could you please include me & keep me in the loop on this issue since we could have system issues.

Thanks Ramona
I think we can get with Ramona and Mary Draemer to discuss.  They may just be able to work it through their contacts at SoCal.  I do think we will want to run the posting past SoCal before we put it out there.

Lindy - Do you know the answers to Ramona's ?s or should we call SoCal to discuss?

FYI,
	Looks like we have a few adm things to get in place before we can implement.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

Lorraine,
	This is Southern's Gallup contract.  I've looked at our yellow file we keep down here and the original agreement only allowed alt RP's & DP's within the path, in the direction of flow, at the discounted rate.  Then, I see an amendment to allow them alternate DP's at the CA Border.  I don't see anything else here.  Are you aware of any deals that allowed them to use alt RP's in East of Thoreau?

Ramona,
	Can you ask Dennis to look in Envision &/or pull the official contract file for you and check to see if there are any other amendments? 

Thanks, 
Lindy

Lindy.

While testing the TMS nomination and scheduling processes that Interface into the new CMS system, I have found a TW Firm contract with Southern Energy Inc. # 26719 that was set up back in May or June of 2000 which has several alt. receipt templates that are outside the primary path. The primay path for this contract is San Juan Bloomfield receipts to Socal Needles as primary delivery. It shows up in production with alt. receipt groups in Central, West Texas, and Panhandle. Is this correct?

Thanks Ramona

Tuesday at 2:00 is good for me!

Instead of tomorrow, how does Tuesday, March 12, at 2:00 pm work for people?  Sorry about the delay.

Thanks,

Just wanted to let you know I had a phone message from Nancy Mallard(sp?) today.  Her daughter is a bunny.  She had a suggestion for the basket.  The James Avery catalog has some sterling silver charms (for a bracelet or a necklace) that are bugs.  A dragon fly ($17.50), a honey bee ($12.50) and a lady bug ($15).

I left her a message and told her I thought it sounded like a great idea.  I told her we would get back with her after next week (& collecting donations) to see if she would like to purchase one to donate for the basket or if she could provide us with the catalog (because I don't receive that one).  I've already looked on the internet to see if I could get a look.  Apparently, there's not a website.

FYI, we'll touch-base later.

Lindy

I can be there.

Please plan to attend a short meeting Wednesday, March 13 at 10:30 in ECN 3907 to discuss TW Firm shippers' amendments, transactional reporting, and "Holding Capacity".

The session should not last more than 1 hour.

Thank you.

Here is the projected subscribed capacity and revenue through 2010.  This was updated in February, 2002.  Please review it to determine all of this info is appropriate to be provided to the rating agencies.  Most (if not all) of TW's contracts have confidentiality provisions concerning the rates.  I'm assuming we have Confidentiality Agreements with the rating agencies.

Should John Duschinske and Greg Porter be listed on the officers for Transwestern?

I thought you might want to review this too :)

As I mentioned in the staff meeting, please find attached for your review and comment the first draft of TW's Section 7(c) application requesting Commission authorization to certificate the addition of 10,000 Dth/day of capacity on Transwestern's San Juan lateral.  Also, please note that the exhibit section is not complete in this draft.

Thanks,

Well, I can't meet at 10:00.  Steve just asked me to attend a "Stan restructuring" meeting for him at 10:00 (Steve's on vacation).  I'd say let's reschedule for this afternoon, but I want to wait to see if there's anything we have to do ASAP from this meeting this afternoon.  Let me get back with you.

10 works for me.  Where on 39 are you?

Cheers.

We have collected $85 so far.  Yipee!!

I see at the bottom of the Business Plan where Tracy has asked for written assumptions for the forecast from you.  Has this been completed?  Steve would like to see this by sometime tomorrow morning for his review before our 2:00 meeting.  When will we have this?

Attached is the latest iteration on the Tranwestern model.
hdt
 << File: TW.model.r1.0a.xls >> 

Currently, Transwestern is considering the TransPecos project, a joint venture where Transwestern would own a 50% undivided interest in a new pipeline with capacity of 311 MMcf/d accessing Mexican markets near the El Paso/Juarez area.

Sounds like it's more than just us!

folks from our group who have been looking at this. I want to make sure

up and then move forward as necessary. Thanks.

   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.

   ========================

   As for the new idea ----

   I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational "events" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
   Pipelines.

   These "events" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  "event" and gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational "events" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.

   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
   Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the
   other
   officers.

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:

      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our "guarantee"
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.

I don't know if Perry has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with WTX Pool capacity and about that Duke contract you mentioned in our Staff Mtg yesterday, but I looked at my notes and this is what I come up with.

The Duke contract that expires 7/31/2002 without ROFR is already taken into consideration as expired in the November, 2002 capacity of 17,300/d we derived last week (which we've already sold 20,000/d to Calpine & PPL).

Other contracts expiring in 2002 & early 2003 from the WTX Pool are:

	25841	PG&E	17,200/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	26511	PG&E	  8,165/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	Total		25,365/d

	26683	APS	8,000/d		3/31/2003	(subject to ROFR)
		
Otherwise, we have WTX Pool capacity every Apr-Oct of 14,000/d (opposite of SWG's seasonal ctrc).

The other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement.  For the month of November, 2002 (for example) we have 22,000/d of capacity we are including in our WT-1 total that is made up of southward paths (20,000/d for USGT & 2,000/d for Astra with receipts north of WT-1 for delivery to WTX delivery points south of WT-2).  This is the most conservative capacity reservation policy.  In the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of WT-1 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of WT-1, we would need to compress gas south through WT-1 to make deliveries for these two contracts.  We may want to reassess this. 

I took a day of vacation (8 hour day) on Tuesday, 11/16.  I had two sick days on 11/17 & 18.

Yes, Shelley & I discussed this on Monday.  Isn't that interesting?  I wish we could slip this into some data request or something.

Lindy,  I accidentally left you off my earlier distribution to the marketers.  FYI, Kim.

FYI

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA "wish list" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA "wish list", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a "settlement" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.

Thanks!

This report does not include the Red Rock expansion contracts.

Here's the ROFR spreadsheet.  The last time I updated it was 9/17/01.  I just had Dennis run a report out of CBS yesterday so that I could sync-up the ROFR spreadsheet for any long-term contracts, but I haven't had a chance to do it yet.

 

Kim asked me to send the attached spreadsheet to you.  It's my listing of TW's firm contracts where I track ROFR.  This is a complete list as of 9-17-01 of all long-term contracts (seasonal or longer).  Any monthly deals may not be included.  Dennis Lee has a report he runs from CBS of all currently effective contracts and contracts with future effective dates for me to cross-check that I have everything.

The first tab "ROFR Criteria" is a complete list of currently effective contracts including (at the bottom) contracts with future effective dates and the Red Rock Expansion contracts.  The receipt and delivery areas are noted.  The tabs following show the subscribed capacity for certain segments of TW's pipe (West of Thoreau, Blanco to Thoreau & Ignacio to Blanco) by month through 2006.

Dear Ahmed,

	Thank you so much for sharing!  I can't tell you what a sweet boy he is!! I have the picture of him today (with his eyes open) as my screen saver.  Everyone in my office is in love with Khalid!
	Well, I hope you are okay and have maybe caught up on some sleep.  Hopefully, Khalid will be a good sleeper.  I told Amy that this was enough to make me want to get on a plane.  Maybe Tony, Sam & I will be able to come visit soon.  I'm so excited that Sam will have a cousin near his age.  He has Riley (turned 2 yrs. on Oct 4th) and Peyton (was 3 yrs. in June) who are brothers and live in San Antonio (Tony's brother Larry's boys).  But we are thinking that we've never been to Memphis and it would be a great place to visit!
	Sam is doing wonderfully.  As everyone will tell you, they grow up so fast.  Just enjoy every moment - these boys are little miracles!  Sam has started saying alot of words (moon, house, ball, cookie, crackers, buckle) and he is going to be a lion for halloween - he's been practicing his roar.  What will Khalid be?  Sam is also trying to put on his shoes and socks.  He is fascinated with buckles - he can buckle, but not unbuckle yet.  He is almost riding his tricycle.
	Everything else is good here.  My mom and Charlie have started driving here today.  They will get to Houston tomorrow night.  Tony is driving the Corvair in a parade Saturday and then, of course, we are watching the Baylor game.
	I'm so glad to hear your mom and dad are coming this weekend.  I bet they cannot wait.  I hope they are able to visit often.  It is so important to me that Sam knows my mom, Charlie, my dad & Flo.  I was so lucky to get to grow-up with my grandparents in town and I wish that Sam will have the same.
	Have fun with sweet Khalid and take care of Amy.  It sounds like you all are doing great!

Love,
Lindy

Dave,
	How are you?  I hope all is going well with your new job.  I'm sorry we won't be able to meet this Friday.  Can I call or e:mail you to set-up another time?

I'll look forward to seeing you soon.

Thanks,

     If possible, I would like for you to sit down with Lindy and a few
folks from our group who have been looking at this. I want to make sure
that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be
duplicating anything. I will have Lindy contact you so we can set something
up and then move forward as necessary. Thanks.

   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.

   ========================

   As for the new idea ----

   I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational "events" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
   Pipelines.

   These "events" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  "event" and gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational "events" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.

   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

   Steve -

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
   Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the
   other
   officers.

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:

      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our "guarantee"
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.

How does this look?

 

Rich,
	Give me a call when you have a chance to discuss.
Thanks,
Lindy

Thanks for everyone's help on this and I apologize for being so late in answering back . We've been on team reviews for the last couple of weeks, doing reviews during the day and traveling to next location. I agree that we should approach them from the Special Service side. At this time we have our yearly meeting set up for Nov. 12th but this could change. Todd Stubbs is ready but Bob Checketts is having problems scheduling this week. He's tied up on a security task force for their company. Todd should let me know this week if we're still on for the 12th.  Lindy do you or someone else plan to attend the meeting? If not I'll plan to visit with Todd and see how he reacts to the facility upgrade if that's OK with everyone. I'm still not sure if we plan to do this next year but will find out this week and let you know.

Normally we have our meeting by September 1st but NW was setting it up this year and November was targeted for a meeting. I'll give you a call on Monday and we can discuss. Do you think we need a conference call to discuss?

Thanks
RJ

I agree with using your Special Services assessment. It's not an expansion as there is no increase in certificated capacity. So nothing ventured, nothing gained.

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

 

James, please find the file attached with the SoCal amounts in dispute as we discussed.  Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Richard,
We are meeting tomorrow afternoon (internally) to discuss a possible SoCal settlement position.  Could you verify the amounts from March, 2001 through September, 2001 by lunch time tomorrow?  (I was using a combination of a spreadsheet Linda Ward had provided to me a couple months ago and inquiring in the CBS invoice system.  I want to make sure I have the most current information.)  If not, let me know your timing.  Also, have we been billing interest on the disputed amounts?  I don't see anything in the invoice system.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Lindy  

Attached is a spreadsheet where James has calculated the interest owed by SoCal.  The interest totals about $0.5 MM.

We have not been billing interest.  The system does not generate an interest invoice until the disputed amount is paid.  Then, based upon when it's paid, the interest is calculated.

 

The last slide I'm working on is the "Detail of Market Value" slide.  I have a draft completed, but Steve has not been able to review it.  As long as I can get time with him in the morning and the changes aren't significant I should be able to have the presentation to you.

Do you think I can the TW presentation on Wednesday by 12:00?

Thanks

Tracy

Attached is a revised offer per our conference call yesterday.  The 1st tab is the summary.  The 2nd tab has the calculations (as well as for the other alternatives we discussed).

 

Oh!  Doesn't he just steal your heart?  Thank you for the pictures.  I have the 3rd one on my screen background.  What an angel!  I'm glad you liked everything and it fits.  I hope you can find a tiny little picture of his sweet little face to put in his blue bejeweled frame.  

Isn't our Sam a handsome boy!  He says pickle, boat, nose, eyes, daddy's car, grandma (this is when he's referring to Tony with a blanket wrapped around his head like a scarf), milk, water, beans, hush chloe & I get binky.  He is wonderful.

Sam & I are bonding this weekend.  The kids were all 3 going to NYC with Lisa for the weekend, but Anthony doesn't want to go.  So, he's staying with us, but he and Tony are going to the river in Utopia, TX to take Anthony deer hunting for the first time.  They're staying at Tony's grandma's house.  She's very excited to see them. Anthony is very excited and wanted to know if they could get him some "camo" Friday night (it's all about the clothes these days).

That's about all I know.  It's good that you're going into work and getting out of the house.  It sounds like you're hanging in there.  I hope you're able to get some more sleep.  I'm sure it won't seem soon enough, but you will get to sleep again sometime in the next year or so =)  (It does sound like a long time when you say it out loud.  Sorry.  It'll go by fast!)

I'm excited that Khalid will be baptized by your friend.  He sounds like an enlightened man and I think it's nice for him to recognize both your and Ahmed's faith.  Khalid is a lucky baby.  I wish we could be there.

Take care and tell Ahmed hi.  Give Khalid a kiss & a squeeze.

Love,
Lindy

Let me know if we're syncing-up.

If we're off in June - Dec, check what I have for the Red Rock Adm Ctrc (I know Dennis made some changes.  I think I have the most current, but possibly not.)

Thanks,
Lindy

 

Yes, I did receive it, but I was going to call you because it was issued under my previous married name "Lindy H. Currier".  How could I get it issued in the correct name "Lindy Donoho"?  Please let me know.

Pls confirm that you have received your new WCom calling card.   Thank you.

Let me know if you need any help for Thursday's meeting.

Perry had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated, but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS.  I think that this contract does not have ROFR, but could you confirm this for me?  If my memory is correct, I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk (& more recently TK) to roll for another month or so.  If I'm thinking of the right contract, that would mean that it did not have a ROFR (because it was not for a year or longer) and that it terminated 3/31/2001.

Could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term?  If not, then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it.

Let me know.  Thanks!

You had asked to see a final copy of our presentation.  This is what was sent to Tracy today.  We may have a couple of inserts by Friday.

Please call me or Steve if you have any questions.

 

CAS continues to reserve the capacity under the contract, as if it's not terminated, as long as there is a ROFR flag on the contract.  ROFR indicates that the customer has a contractual right to extend the contract pursuant to certain parameters in the tariff.

I took the ROFR flag off.  Since it is expired, I can't really figure out how it affects CAS.  I'm confused.

But I will also look in the file.

FYI for our meeting Tuesday, 11/27 at 2:00 with Dave.

Lindy -

While it is fresh on my mind -- it would be great if you could capture the
following information before our meeting:

 - the amount of Unamoritized Accrued Earnings related to Gallup (remember
- Andersen wouldn't let us take it as MTM) [Centilli should have access to
this information]
- the amount of the rebates you have been receiving from ECS for Gallup
related to the demand charge miss [Centilli should have access to this
information]
- copies of all the ECS agreements (Bisti, Bloomfield, Gallup, WT1,
Hubbard)
- Hubbard run hours and payments ECS - last 3 years [you can ask John Sturn
for this]
- Projected amount of TW fuel over collection 2002
- A list of the other ETS electric compressors [John Sturn]
- Total non-compressor related electric charges ETS paid in 2000 and 2001 -
someone in Wasaff's group should have this / or someone in Omaha.

See you then.

It had come up in a meeting that TW was being allocated some $$ associated with NNG personnel (probably storage desk in Houston & Omaha and risk management people).  Is there anyway that you can tell us the people (partial people) who are being allocated to TW?

I'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have Shipper imbalances.  Here are my comments.

 

Attached is a draft of the letter that we propose to send to the CPUC regarding the AL2837 proceeding in which SoCal Gas is proposing changes to its "windowing" criteria. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. We need to file this tomorrow, so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today, if possible. Thanks.

 << File: 11-21-01 Transwester Advice Comments 2837-A - DRAFTl1.doc >> 

I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to "shippers", we could refer to "customers" instead.

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

 << File: 11-21-01 Transwester Advice Comments 2837-A - DRAFTl1.doc >> 

My other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows:

Section 35.2
	2nd paragraph, 3rd sentence.  Explanation of "incremental revenue".  When we talk about revenues which TW already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.  What if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet?  The language is so specific.  Can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what TW already has contractually committed?

	2nd paragraph, last sentence.  The phrase "guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate".  What does this mean?  TK & I were both a littles confused by this language.

	4th paragraph, 4th sentence.  The phrase "the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline".  TK, is the phrase "published indices" generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes?  I realize it will probably have to be something that is published.

Amy confirmed for me that USGT's scheduled volumes West on Ctrcc 27161 since 11/1/01 total 13,785.  She is not including the volumes for today (11/20), since it's not a final volume for the day yet.

FYI.
	Please see the attached memo, summarizing the various covenants contained in merger and loan documents that have 
	been executed in the last two weeks.  These covenants are important, as they relate to ETSC's, TW's, and NNG's ongoing 
	operations.

I have a 2:00 meeting with a customer.  It should only last about an hour, but I might be able to be there until 3:15 or 3:30.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, 11/27/01 at 3:00pm in room 3907  to discuss PLE, TMS, CBS, & Rate system changes that would be required to add additional areas or basins to TW in order to handle this request from Marketing and regulatory regarding TW's East of California rate structure tariff issues. If I have missed anyone on the distribution list, please forward. A decision is needed on this item by 11/29/01.

Thanks Ramona 
Ramona,

Please take this and run with it and find out what the best solution is.  We need information on what the different options are and what the best solution is for January implementation of the change.  Let me know what help you might need.  The major impact seems to be to TMS and Accounting, with minor affects to CRS and CMS (determining credit and gaining the correct max rate).  We really need to have the solution defined by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, or earlier if possible.

Thanks a bunch and let me know.

Andy,
I wanted to clarify on the item related to the West of Thoreau area.
To me, I think that we could create a new Basin in PLE and call it East of California. The area is still W. of Thoreau with two basins in that area. Maybe  check with Elizabeth to make sure she agrees. I have attached the POI view of one of the points that should be changed to the East of California basin. Let me know what you think.

Thanks Ramona

How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

 

TK,
	Would you be able to attend this meeting at 3:00?  I will be there ASAP (maybe at 3:00 even), but I'm meeting on the electric compression agreements at 2:00 and I think I may not be able to get to this meeting until 3:15 or 3:30.  Please let Ramona know.

Thanks!

Can you see if maybe TK can come at 3:00 ?

	Here is the e:mail about BP Chemicals.  Thank you for your help.
Lindy

(Dawn, Mark is with ENA on the Texas Desk and is going to try to track this down.)

Dawn,  Transwestern doesn't sell the physical gas anymore and this is likely to be sold by ENA-  I'm forwarding this to our TW commercial team to see if they have any names. Lindy,  can you help?? hope it works-   good job on searching for an answer for a customer!

Mary Kay,

I found your contact information from the Transwestern Pipeline Company
website at the contact for Certificates. I work in the Enron building in
Houston in Weather Risk, and yesterday I received a phone call from a
customer (BP Chemicals in Green Lake Texas) looking for a certificate of
analysis for natural gas sold to them by Enron. I was unable to get much
information from the customer, other than a station ID0981367, and the
location. I am very new to Enron, and have tried to find the correct
person to redirect BP's request to. Do you by chance know who the
correct contact is?

Thank you for any help you might be able to provide.

Sincerely,

Dawn Armfield

Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday dear Margy, happy birthday to you!

How are you?  Brett?  Shayne & Summer?  Your family?  I hope everyone is well and coping with all that has happened.  We are fine down here.  My mom & Charlie are coming for a visit next week.  They were flying, but now they're driving.  I think we could all get into the whole family truckster thing again.  Tony & I have decided we probably need the van with the TV/VCR in the ceiling now.  By the way, how is Summer?  What did the doctor have to say about her germ thing, etc?  I hope you all are working through that ok.

I hope you are doing something special for your birthday - going out to dinner with your family & kids and/or maybe a night out with just Brett & you - there's a treat!  Tony & I got a babysitter (one of Sam's teachers) last Saturday for no particular reason and just went out to eat & to a movie (Serendipity - it was a cute romantic comedy.  Just about all I need these days - light & funny & not too much brain power.)

Well, please take the time to celebrate this day - the day we all lucked out and you were born!  Tell Brett it really was his lucky day!  Spend some time with your mom & dad - they were both there =)  And remember the best birthday gift you ever got - the gift of this life - what more wonderful thing could there be?  It was a gift to all of us that have the pure pleasure of knowing you, Margy.  My life would not be the same without you =)

I love you & miss you, my friend.

 I did not change the 2001 prices except for Nov/Dec.                              << File: Lindypricing.xls >> 

TK could you update these prices for me for the Stan Presentation (one more time - it's due to Tracy on Thurs)?

I don't need the historical NYMEX again, unless Vernon has the NYMEX settle price for Jan - Sept '01 (Weren't the historical numbers from last week Inside FERC because we were having a system problem?)

I need them by tomorrow after lunch.  I'm in a meeting from 8:00 to 12:00 tomorrow.  If you have any questions, leave me a voicemail - I'll check it during break.

How does this look?

Yes, I set it up with Ken & Dan.  We had a good discussion.  I'm going up for the weekly Imbalance meeting today to discuss some things with Darrell and Richard (Dan will be there).  Tracy & I are also meeting with Dan & John on Thursday to try to "diagram" some of the accounting process with imbalances, linepack & fuel (LOOK OUT!).  When we get the explanation organized, we will be presenting it to all y'all =)

I hope you had a nice weekend in San Antonio.  I know the weather was wonderful.  Hope Hershal is doing better.

Lindy, I just saw this.  Did you know about this meeting?  I hope you were able to attend.  Thanks, Kim.

After the TW Marketing meeting in EB #1336 today please stay to discuss Ken Powers daily TW system reports.  We want to work on improving the daily imbalance reporting.

 

Attached is the list of items and prices.  I'll put a check for $37 in Amanda's bag today (if I'm there before you) or tomorrow.  It might be today if I can arrange to meet Rita to drop-off my items to her during lunch.  Maybe I'll get to see you there dropping-off stuff - I'd love to see everything picked-out.

Lindy, what was our total plan margin for 2001 before the Tennaska adjustment. Please ask Jan ASAP.

Here's the note on TK's party.

Love You,
Lind
Save the date for another exciting, thrilling, the place to be gathering at T.K.'s on , Saturday, October 13th at 7:00 p.m.

The dinner theme will be Italian food. You will be able to experience the culinary delights of Loretta (T.K.'s sister) and tour T.K.'s new renovated kitchen (by our own Tony Donoho).  

Don't miss this event and mark your calendars now.  More details will be forthcoming.  

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

Either time is good for me.

Please be informed, Steve would like to meet for an hour to discuss strategy on the 2002 Plan.

Good job!!

Here is the final version from Houston with the additional changes recommended by Mary Kay and the correction to the filing date.  No other changes have been made to the document distributed last night.

Rita - Please keep in mind our conversation this afternoon regarding additional comments that resulted from my meeting with Shelley, Lynn, Terry and Darrell during our review/approval of these reports.  Let me know if any of these reports are modified so we have a copy of the final version filed with the FERC.

 << File: FERC docket RM01-9_Aug2001final.xls >> 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

I have nothing to report =)

No problem-o!

Lindy, Since I will be gone tomorrow and next week.  Would you mind providing this information to Carmen?  I owe you one!  

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim, I was referred to you by Audrey Robertson. 

I work for Morris Brassfield in his Contracts Administration dept. He has asked me to pull and make copies of all the O&M agreements for TW  that are being billed monthly so that we can review. 

The following is a list of O&M agreements that I am looking for. 

ECT/Bisti
ECT/Bloomfield
PNM Gas Services/Blanco Hub
Northwest Pipeline/Blanco Hub
Northwest Pipeline/La Plata

Would you have or know who would have the original executed agreements so that I can make copies for the Contracts department.  If you do have them I would be glad to go and make the copies myself.

Thanks,
Carmen (x56269)

According to Glen, these were just orders granting rehearing on some issues=
.  We still have to proceed with compliance of the requirements.  We're sub=
mitting our first report on Friday for the month of August.

Lindy,  Do you know if this means any changes for us?  Kim.

=09I believe that, unless a stay is granted, we must comply with the requir=
ements.

Christi --  I don't think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 e=
ither, and we are proceeding under the same schedule.  Several rehearing re=
quests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES.  However, note the follow=
ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercia=
l and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without re=
ading it.)  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O=
MB ruling a good sign. =20

As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budge=
t (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for "Reporting o=
f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market" through the six-month emergen=
cy period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements a=
re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  Howev=
er, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re=
porting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Informat=
ion Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as p=
art of its supporting statement (more specifically, "include an explicit di=
scussion").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of th=
e FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems =
with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co=
llection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business=
 in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep o=
ur records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, =
and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan=
t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale=
.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to=
 the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir=
es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo=
rting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it=
 intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide w=
ith the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical uti=
lity of requiring disaggregated data when "commenters" reported that they d=
id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way. =
 OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d=
ata manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation woul=
d likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti=
mates after "consulting with respondents", and it must provide a list of th=
e names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would =
not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be =
that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sen=
ds a signal!

 << File: IC01-721.00A (OMB).doc >>=20

Does this result in any change to the requirements to comply on 9/30?  I do=
n't see any, but was curious??  Mary Kay

FERC issued this tolling order today  on natural gas sales to California

http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/RULES/RM/RM01-9.001.TXT

and issued a notice rescheduling the Sixth Interstate Facility Planning Sem=
inar until October 26, 2001

http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/MISC/M_MS/MS092401.000.TXT

It loods good!  Thank you so much.  I'll let you know if we need anything else after Steve looks at the graphs/charts.

How does this look?

                                      << File: Lindypricing.xls >> 

 

It looks good!  I had a few comments on pages 7 & 9.

Also, on page 13 - # 26 & 27, is there any benefit to more specifically describing why we "understood" and why they "knew" that the San Juan lateral contract would be base loaded due to their long-term firm supply arrangement with Pan Alberta that existed prior to and after the Global Settlement rates were negotiated?  FERC is aware of this longstanding and complex arrangement involving PGT, NWPL, TW, Pan Alberta, SoCal and SoCal's affiliate, PITCO.  It would seem a huge oversight on SoCal's part that this lower rate they supposedly negotiated and agreed to with TW was not memorialized in the Global Settlement or in TW's tariff.  This is a rate that applies to two-thirds of the volumes SoCal transports under contract 8255 and allegedly SoCal and TW had some verbal agreement (with a 10 year term) that would apply to these volumes.

Attached is a revised draft Complaint against SoCalGas incorporating comments that I received.  I am faxing the attachments to you separately.  Excuse the numbering and spacing if it is not perfect.  Pls. comment asap.  Once we finalize the documents, we can discuss how we share this with SoCalGas.  Thanks, Maria

I just wanted to say it was good to see you the other day, though brief =)  Let's get together soon for lunch or something.  I'm missing my Bob time!

 
Lindy: 

John just emailed me the pictures of Sam.  He is the cutest!  I can't get over how much he has grown since I saw him.  Your Dad is anxious to see these pictures so I have run copies on my color printer--they came out great.  Good job!

I've been thinking about you a lot and know these are stressful times.   Somehow I guess it all works out like it is supposed to.  

Give Sam hugs and kisses from us and of course some for you and Tony too. 

Love you, 
Flo 

I can be there.

It has been a tough couple of months and I know that each of you have worked hard.  I appreciate your time and commitment and hoped to something for the staff but, due to the company's dire situation, it is not possible.   
Please join me for a group lunch at Little Pappasito's on Thursday, December 20th at 11:30.  As much as I would like to treat the group, everyone would be responsible for their meal.
Please RSVP to Julie Armstrong at x33597. Hope you can attend. Thanks.

Per our conference call today, here are some ideas to get TW Settlement Value.

1.	SoCal to commit to TW to let us schedule transport at the SoCal/Topock (South Needles) delivery point.

2.	SoCal to turnback 20,000 to 25,000/d of receipt capacity from the WTX Pool, at no cost to TW (SoCal continues to pay for it).

3.	TW has been scheduling PG&E's payback to SoCal at SoCal/Topock to help PG&E and SoCal.  SoCal to schedule this as transport from PG&E/Topock (as a RP) to SoCal/Topock (DP) and pay TW transport fee.

4.	SoCal to agree (in writing) to dedicate to TW the incremental 50,000/d at Needles becoming available Jan, 2002 until Red Rock Expansion in-service.

5.	SoCal to amend their OBA to dollar-valued (from volumetric) and cash-out their existing OBA with TW (at TW's index value).

6.	SoCal to sell storage to TW.

7.	SoCal to purchase incremental Thoreau to West of Thoreau capacity from TW.

8.	Extension of SoCal's mainline &/or San Juan lateral contracts.  Or early notice of termination or early notice of ROFR trigger (so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it).

Can we all plan to get on the phone with Maria tomorrow (Thurs) at 10:00 to discuss some questions with Elizabeth about East of CA?  We've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes (reporting and system mod's, etc.) and want to get it all straight.

Elizabeth, can you come to th 13th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call Maria?

Thanks!

Maria, Please let me know when  you can meet tomorrow.  TK is out tomorrow through Dec 26th, but we can't meet this afternoon because Elizabeth is out today.  So, let me know when Elizabeth & I can get with you tomorrow.

The other option is to get together this afternoon.  Pls. let me know.  Maria

Please let me know a soon as possible this morning (by 9:30 if possible) what the annual dollars are we collect from NWPL & PNM for the Blanco Hub and from NWPL for the La Plata Facilities.  I need the total dollars (both the Operating and Market Services together).  I just need a ballpark number.  Whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the Blanco Hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the La Plata Facilities.

THANK YOU!!

Lindy

Kevin needs to know how much money TW made in 2001 on excess fuel sales (whatever is the most current number - 3rd CE?).  And then he would also like to know revenue in the 2002 Plan dependent on excess fuel sales - let's use the Plan numbers as submitted in Nov.  (FYI Kevin, we are re-looking at the 2002 Plan right now & there could be changes.)

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in "constrained" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

The total number would be $330,000 per year.

Lindy, attached is the budget that was verbaly agreed to by the Hub Partners for 2002.

Lindy, you have received the revised Blanco Hub Partnership 2002 O&M Budget (Overheads corrected).  I'm working with Devon Hunt with NWPL on the La Plata A/Ignacio Pipeline 2002 O&M Budget to correct the overheads on it.  Everything else on the Operating Budget was agreed on by the Partners as John stated, only the overhead amount has to be revised.  As soon as I get this straightened out I'll send you the corrected budget.

Amy & Ahmed,
	Thank you so much for the pictures of Khalid.  We are so disappointed we will not get to see him at Christmas.  Maybe we can plan a trip to Memphis sometime in the coming year.  I wanted to let you know that we've sent a box of "stuff" to your house.  They are hand-me-downs from Sammy - clothes & his whirlin' twirlin' garden.  Please feel free to sell in a garage sale or donate anything you don't want/need.  Hopefully he can get some use out of some things.
	How are you all?  Getting ready for the trip to Omaha?  Are you driving or flying?  Everyone is good here.  We will get the kids Friday and have them until the evening of Christmas Eve.  Sam is having a Christmas party at school this Thursday.  I'm going to be baking cookies for that.  Sam is wonderful!!  He is the sweetest boy.  I've finally figured-out the digital camara, so I'll try to send some pic's soon.
	Take care.  We love & miss you.  Lindy

Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  

	Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights.
	The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.

Panhandle also filed on March 14, 1997 for scheduling alt FT by price at Docket No. RP97-291 (it's referenced in footnotes, but I don't have a copy of the filing).

Craig,
	What is the definition of "non-standard" for your purposes?  Give me a call to discuss and I'll verify. (X36007)
Thanks!

Currently, my title is "Director Customer Service Initiatives (I think?), Marketing, Transwestern Pipeline Company".

I thought it would be wise to broaden my horizons up here by applying to be licensed in the State of Nebraska.  Can I put you down as a client/reference?  By the way, what should I put down as your current occupation?  Maria

The only thing I have to add, if this is our premise, Williams Field Services is not an "owner" of the Blanco Hub.  Only PNM, NWPL and Transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee (because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline).  I'm wondering if it's appropriate for WFS to have a "hub" agreement, if the purpose is for the Operator (TW) to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners' capacity.  

Here's what I found out about HUB agreements:

	1/2 day		Monday morning, 1/28
	2 days		Thursday & Friday, 1/31 & 2/1 (Sam's school is closed)

Please let me know if there are any conflicts with this schedule.

Thanks,
Lindy

I'm sorry I won't be in the office tomorrow.

Lindy

I was trying to respond to your message about the IOS meeting Friday & I lost it.

I will not be able to be at the meeting.  I am not in the office on Friday.  Please let me know if it will be rescheduled or when we can meet to discuss.

Thanks again,
Lindy

Here's the latest!
Check out the latest on Enron.  Think it will make the top 40?

 
   

Teb,
	I'm sorry I wasn't in this morning.  Can you fill me in on the meeting when you have time? 
Thanks,

Please plan to attend a meeting in EB1336 on Monday, January 28 from 10:15 a.m. - 11:15 a.m. to discuss Transwestern's pending Order No. 637 compliance filing.

What is the elementary school for the Autumn Lake subdivision?

Thank you,
Lindy Donoho

Amy & Ahmed,
	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart!
	We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy!
	I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that!
	Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing.
	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know.
	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton.
	The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =)
	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.

Take care!
Love,
Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids
	

Hi Everyone:

Khalid is doing great and is a very happy baby.  As you can see from the pictures, he loves to laugh and smile at his Daddy!

He is still on his same schedule.  He sleeps every night from about 8:00 PM until 7:00 AM.  He loves to go to bed at night.  If it is after 8:00 PM he is rubbing his eyes and looking for his bed!  He likes to sleep in but if it is past 7:30 AM, we have to wake him up!

He eats 8 oz. 4 times per day - at 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM.  He is definitely a growing boy - hardly any of his clothes fit anymore!  His 3-6 month clothes just fit him but will not for very much longer.  I have started buying him 6-9 month clothes.  He still does not like socks or anything on his feet - he kicks them right off.

He loves to put his hands in his mouth and suck on them.  He also still loves to look at all of his toys in his bed and his all-time favorite is definitely still his mobil!

His teachers at school tell Ahmed and me that he is the best baby there.  They definitely have some babies that are "high maintenance" but Khalid is not one of them.  He loves his teacher, Miss Janice, and smiles at her all the time.

We have noticed lately that he really likes to watch football - we have no idea where he would have picked that up :)

Khalid likes to go outside for walks both at school and at home when it is nice outside.  Our weather has been in the high 50's and low 60's so we have been going a lot.  It is great exercise for me and Khalid likes to be on the move!

Ahmed and I are doing great - enjoying these last couple of weeks of football before we go into mourning for 7 months!

Khalid sends his love to each and every one of you.  We hope to see all of you soon.

Love,
Amy, Ahmed & Khalid

Ken,	
	Did you tell me once that you had documented the calculations contained in the Daily Balance report?  I'm thinking (oh-oh) that I might not be able to talk with you after Friday and I wondered if you could send me a copy of your documentation &/or let me know who will have the file (Richard Hanagriff)?

Thanks,
Lindy

Please see attached.

How are you?!  It's so good to hear from you.  Of course I get the updates from Lorrainey & I knew about your new job.  I hope everything is going well there.  Lorraine said that you really liked it.  I thought of Florabama when I heard you were hired at Duke.  Lucky we didn't do anything truly offensive (I don't think) in our negotiations with them.  We need to meet you for lunch someday.

It would be great to see Jeff too, if we could get ahold of him.  He called the other day with a building question.  He sounded good and said Lisa had some irons in the fire.

Everything here is...wierd!!  And it's pretty sad.  The NNG commercial people go over (red rover, red rover) to Dynegy starting Friday.  (This would include Mary Kay - talk about a midlife crisis!)  It's all pretty sad (along with Lay resignation, Baxter suicide, etc.)  The new guy started today - who knows?!

How is Craig?  It looks like Calpine is holding their own.  I've left some messages for Diana, but haven't heard back from her.

Sam is wonderful.  He is talking alot and he's very busy!!  My dad and my stepmom, Flo, were here this last weekend for a visit.  Tony and I got to go out to dinner and to a movie - WOW!

Thanks for keeping in touch.  Let's rally the troops soon for a ladies luncheon.

Lindy

Hi Lindy!  Laura McGuire and I were talking about you today.  Remember we
were working on Florabama and we met her for lunch and it was pouring down
rain?!  She was in my office today for a meeting and it took us a while to
remember how we knew each other.  She got married in January; I think her
new last name is Heckman.

Anyway, I was thinking about you and I hope you're doing well thru all this
Enron mess.  How is Sam?  talking up a storm already?

Take care--

Susan

Can I help you with anything else for the TW presentation?

Please see the attached PowerPoint presentation.  This is a first draft of certain sections (Industry Environment, Competitive Environment and Revenue Generation) of the TW Ratings Package.

 

FYI - status of TW presentation.

Not yet - we are pulling together numbers for the package.  We will hit it hard early next week.

March 9th would  be good for us.  Thanks!

Lindy

All,

Sarah and I would like to host a dinner for the gang.

Please check your calendars to see if either of these two dates work.

March 9th or March 16th.

Let me know if one, either or neither date is available.

Lindy, Tony and Sam: 

Thank you very much for the fun visit this past weekend.  Of course the highlight of our trip was being with Sam.  I don't have to tell you we really miss that bright, shining face!  It's amazing how quickly you become attached.  When we woke up Tuesday morning we both said how much we already missed being able to be with him.  He spoiled us quickly.  I told Lisa and John they should go and visit to enjoy his adorable personality and fun age.  

Our trip home was not what we expected, but it could have been worse.  Going through Chicago seemed a round about way to get to Omaha from Houston, but it worked out fine and we arrived here only about 2 hours later than the original schedule.  Flying can definitely be an adventure.

I not only miss Sam, but I miss your warm weather too!  It is cold and dreary today and the weatherman said we will probably have snow tonight and tomorrow.  I shouldn't complain--this winter has been wonderful.  But at the same time I truly enjoyed not having to wear a coat.  

I know you are looking forward to having the next two days off from work (plus the weekend).  

Thanks again for the nice visit.  We really had a good time.  Give Sam hugs and kisses from us.  We miss all of you! 

Love you. 

Flo and Papa Flo 

This Wed or Thurs, could you update the monthly Cal '02 prices for me again?

							Permian
							San Juan	
							SoCalGas

Hopefully, this will be the last time.  I need to give Tracy the final version of an abbreviated presentation (for Ken Lay mtg 11/8) by the end of this week.  I just wanted to refresh the numbers one more time.

It's a kids weekend, so we'll see if we can get babysitters.

I'm afraid we are leaning toward the 16th now.  I hope you can still make it.

March 9th would  be good for us.  Thanks!

Here is a diagram of the general segment capacities on Transwestern for the past 2006 analysis.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Lindy

 

 
Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-
Davis

Jan already has TW's average historical rates derived from TW's actuals (contract rates and throughput/MAXDTQ's) totaled up to TW's contract paths for 2000 and 2001.  I am going to use these numbers to allocate the path average rates to the pipeline segments in Davis' template.

I got the info but wanted to know more about the preset programs.  The net 
advertisement shows 20 preset programs, but the info I received only shows 
4.  I also wanted to know what the display looked like.  The literature does 
not show what the display  looks like.  I have what the 9.2 looks like but it 
appears that the 9.6 is different.  Also how fast does this machine get to.  
This machine has a 10 year warrenty.  Who will service this in Texas and If 
for any reason treadmill by net ceases to exist, what are the conditions of 
my warrenty.

On the preset programs can I just say I want to run X distance whether it is 
a hill workout, time or what ever?

What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?

Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20 
intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for 
an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?

Tom Donohoe

Here is the contract information.  The contract group could not locate the 
CES-Devon contract so all I have is the info from TAGG and Sitara.

For the GTC and GISB contracts that have no paper, I wrote price and location 
on the EXCEL spreadsheat.

Tom Donohoe

I am in need of several more contract copies.  Could you please forward me 
contract:
 96037261
 96049419
 96001003
 96045391

Also, you had mentioned earlier that GISB contracts should not have been used 
on some of the contracts I earlier received.  Are the appropriate contracts 
going to be sent out,  or are we stuck with the ones in place. 

Call with questions.  3-7151

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Tom,

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

Dear Todd,

I did not hear from Jay at E-Prime.  Were my qualifications not what he was looking for?

It requires a strong knowledge of the wholesale electricity business, and minimum gas knowledge.  It also requires a solid understanding of options evaluation.  I have traded the options but do not have a strong understanding of the greeks.

how about the fuels/ gas position?

Mr. Lay,

Reuters just had an article that said upon closing of the Dynegy deal, you will receive $80,000,000 which buys you out of your employment contract.

Is this true?

If so, since you said in your speech that we are all feeling this pain together, will there be a distribution of the $80,000,000 back to the people who's lives have been crushed and will receive no additional compensation.  It seems unjust that while the people who had nothing to do with the downfall get nothing, the people who were involved in the downfall continue to be well compensated.

I,  as a trader on the gas floor,  am sitting here at my desk still making all attempts to make money for the company, wondering if  I will be getting my next paycheck.  Then I read that you are getting an additional $80,000,000.  I, as well as my fellow employees, feel betrayed once again.  What is the old saying about kicking the dead horse?  The difference is that this horse is still barely breathing and your $80,000,000 just sucked out the final bit of life.

The management level you have been at provides you the inside scoop on all these bad deals and the "pump and dump" that senior management has done to Enron stock over the last years.  It is a disgrace the way you and your senior management have ruined so many peoples lives.  How could you not know that the company would be taking a fall when you signed back on.  Other CEO's coming back into companies under the same situation have accepted no compensation until the company gets back on its feet again.  It seems that you knew what was going to happen, and were able to milk Enron out of another 80 million dollars.

 I have learned a valuable lesson about how business really works.  As an employee, one should milk their company for everything they can get out of it no matter how many people are hurt.  Enron has been a cutthroat stab you in the back organization for a long time.  I always thought it was just my fellow employees doing every thing they could to get ahead.  I never realized that this was the creed that senior management lived by. Senior management must have been in their offices rolling on the floor every time some employee spoke up about trying to make vision and values a success.

You and your teams fine example has changed my life forever.  Aside from the fact that my kids will no longer be going to college, you have changed my thinking for ever.  I will never again believe anything my employers tell me.  I will never again put my company as a top priority.  It is a travesty what you have done to so many peoples lives.  

Tom Donohoe

Dear Greg,

I appreciate you coming down to the gas floor and providing us some information about what is going on.

One of the questions that kept getting asked had to do with who will be retained, and what we will be paid when we are retained.  We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?

I understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.

What we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. 

Scott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?

Getting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.

Please sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.

Tom Donohoe 

I don't understand.  My products will al trade the same except fro wednesday we will only trade day ahead.  We have to leave early because of the move.

Please let us know what days you will be trading next week for the following products:

Audrey,

You should get Martin Cuilla, Jason Williams, and Jim Simpsons info by Monday.  Andy is still questioning his employment  contract.  He does like the idea of the desk moving together though.  If you do get to the long term traders, Bryant Fryhart is excellent in his area.

Talk to you soon.

Tom Donohoe.

Jeanie,

In light of the layoffs that are coming on Monday, if HR is looking for people to layoff, is it  possible to volunteer for the severence package.

Please call if you have any questions.

It appears that the 16,000 was extra gas that the terminal overdelivered.  The imbalance is between the terminal and trunkline.  Dan Masters has agreed to take all these imbalances and net them in january 2002.  ENA has no responsibility for this gas and will not allow it to be put on our agreements.  This will only create an imbalance we will be cashed out on.  In January 2002  the price we settle up at will need to be decided at that time.

Since I never heard back from you I assume this is agreeable to you as well.  Please respond one way or the other so we can get the books closed.

That would be fine with me to settle up in January, 2002. Thanks.

Dan.Masters@enron.com on 04/06/2001 05:43:24 PM

The sendout for that April 16 delivery on the "Hoegh Galleon" begins on May
1, then is ratable through January 31, 2002 on the rest (5 more) of the
"Hoegh Galleon" cargoes.  I would be in favor of settling up at the end of
January for all 6 cargoes since we'll have overage/underage every month.
Let me know what you think.

Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance.

Here is a spreadsheet showing your ending balance as of 3/31/01.

Tammy-
I never heard back from Jim O'leary at Trunkline, but just to make sure we
are on the same page I wanted to confirm our quantities for this month.

From the "LNG Jamal" you should get 3,104,896 MMBtu total in March.  Please
have the contract for the last 51,396 MMBtu faxed to me at 713-646-6560.

From the "Matthew" you should get 2,720,000 MMBtu total in March.  This
number is approximate and will change to an exact number after arrival of
the "Matthew" around Mar 10, however I undertand the gas will be delivered
starting March 1 from Trunkline.

After we get the exact figure from the discharge of the "Matthew" I will
send out another email to show the total amount you will receive from us in
March.  Any quantities over or under this amount should be reconciled
Thanks and regards,

Audrey,

Martin, Jason, and Kevin were asking the status on the Sempra deal.  Are you going to call them and discuss what is going on?  I am not sure what to say.

Tom Donohoe

http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp

There is a possibility that the counterparty should be Duke Field Services,  We are checking it out.

I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,
Scott

if they are not confirming this deal are they confirming 1034254?

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

Scott
5-7213

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

thanks.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Tom,

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

Dear Pastor,

For the last few weeks I have been under all type of excessive work related stress.  I try not to bring any home but this last weekend I was at my wits end and it my family noticed my change.  The more I thought about my situation the more uptight I got.  I didn't know whether to quit or trudge on.

Then came Sunday morning.  I got to my 4 year old class and the troubles were all absent from my mind.  Teaching those kids got my mind off of all the troubles.  I got into the sanctuary and the first words of your sermon, concerning people with problems, were directed right at me.  In a matter of moments I realized I had been trying to deal with these situations on my own, asking no help from the Lord.  In an instant all my stresses were lifted completely.  It is so wonderful the way the Lord works.  He had you plan a sermon that was timed perfectly for the moment I could take the mess at work no longer.

The rest of my day was great!

I came into work this morning and some of the things that were causing stress turned around for the better.

The Lord is great at reminding us who is in charge at all times.

This is not the first time a sermon was perfectly timed.  Just after you joined us, one of your sermons was just what I needed to hear when I was at my wits end.

Thanks for a great sermon and hallelujah to the Lord for watching over his flock.

Sincerely,

Tom Donohoe

I will be joining the East power desk at the beginning of October and I am 
trying to get up to speed on the PJM market. Kevin Prestor thought you would 
be able to help me find some data. I am looking for the following historics 
in excel format (send as much data as you have and feel free to include 
anything else that you think might be relevant):

- Daily prices for PJM( West), Cinergy, NEPP, NYPP, TVA and ERCOT
- HDD's and CDD's for Philedelphia, Allentown Washington DC, Baltimore, 
Pittsburg, Newark, New York City, Cinncinati and any other cities that are 
relevant ?
- Supply outage data for PJM
- Daily Import / Exprot data for PJM
- Historic daily nat gas prices Transco Zone 6 ( NY and Non-NY), Chicago, ... 
???

Again, please feel free to make any suggestions. I am very new to the world 
of power and it is likely that I have overlooked something very obvious.

I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight. Do you know the 
name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation 
services? She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name. I am 
wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers. In 
regards to my visa, I have gathered pretty much all the info. that Margaret 
needs with the exception of University transcripts. I had to order those and 
probably won't get them untill early next week.

Thank you for all your help!

look on the internet at chapters.ca. All electronics / stereo shops have them 
now. Make sure you get one with lots of memory. Take it easy.

Chris

Margaret,

I have completed all of the information and am awaiting my University 
transcripts. The copy in my HR file is missing and I have ordered some but 
this may take 2-3 days. Should I send the other info. and forward the 
transcripts when I receive them or wait and send it all together?

Let me know,

my unregistered account.

Kim,

Could you please explain (pretent you are talking to a 4 year old) the 
details of the following.

a) Health care coverage provided by Enron and any costs associated with that 
coverage including:
 - Medical
 - Dental
 - Vision
Is this enough coverage? Is there supplemental coverage available? What is / 
is not covered? 

b) Life / Accidental Death and Dismemberment / Disability Insurance 

  - What (if any) is provided coverage?

c) What programs concerning retirement saving (company matched savings, 
pension benefits ect...) will I participate in?

 - What are these programs? 
 - How do I sign up?

d) I am told I should opt out of social security. How does that work?

e) What is my vacation allocation? How do unused vacation day work in the US? 

f) In Canada, we have a "Health Spending Account" of $1000 / year that we can 
allocate towards eye glasses, health club memberships ect...
 
 - Does a similar program exist in the US?

g) I will be required to file 2 tax returns (Canada and US) in 2000. Will 
Enron cover the cost of having those returns prepared?

h) Is parking at the Allen Center covered in the offer? If not, could it be? 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

I will be moving to Houston by the end of the month. I am actually going to 
be trading electricity so that should be an interesting change from nat gas.
We will have to hook up once I get settled. How much longer are you going to 
be in Boston? How far is Dallas from Houston? 

Keep in touch!

don't think I'm going to take it after watching the hell he went through.

How are you doing? What are you doing? I am still working for Enron. I have 
been trading nat gas for about 3 years. I am moving to Houston at the end of 
the month. In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US. 
Should be interesting. Crazy volatility. I will probably have a heart attack 
at 26 but that's life. Hope things are going well for you.

sounds correct. Can you sell that stuff for me please. I'll give you a cheque 
this weekend to top up my RRSP.

Thanx,

Chris

I have never done a houseboating trip but they sound like a lot of fun. Was 
the weather good? Houston was hot. Very hot. I better get used to it though 
because I'm moving there. That is why I have been so crazy lately. I am going 
down there to trade power in the North East. Pretty crazy shit. I gotta hop 
but I'll write more later.

Chris

$700 ?

It has to be more than that. I had a $500/month PAC set up that I just 
cancelled in April.

Ryan,

Good to hear things are going well. I am still with Enron but I am in the 
process of moving to Houston. I'm going down there to trade electricity so 
that should be interesting change from nat gas. No wife. No house. No liver. 
That's about it. Hope India was a good time.

I went to Kelly Blue Book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used 
vehicles, a trade in value (what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a 
dealer on trade in) and a retail value (what you might expect to pay for a 
vehicle from a dealer). The following were the values it came up with for a 
Jeep exactly like mine in Montana (closest state).

Trade In - $15330 USD ($22750 CND)
Retail - $20945 USD ($31061 CND)

The retail number seems way too high. I think something like $23 000 to 
$25000 would be fair.

Let me know what you think.

Hello all,

Here is my contact info in Toronto. Thanks to everyone who helped my find a
place and a roommate. The apartment is really nice with 2 BR + a solarium, 2
BA, a dishwasher and washer/dryer, a terrace and etc. It is on the corner of
King and Church and is only about a 7-10 minute walk to Enron.

Brad,

I don't know if you've heard but I am moving to Houston at the end of 
September. I need to know how much I have contributed to my RRSP through you 
this year so I can maximize my annual contributions before I go. Can you 
figure this out and let me know. 

Thanx,

Chris

John,

I am planning to come to Houston Wednesday and Thursday to sit with the East 
desk. Unless that is going to create problems, would you mind letting them 
know that I'm coming. 

Chris

In response to this e-mail. The guy who had the party is Rob Milnthorp. He is 
the Pres. and CEO of Enron Canada. John Disturnall is our option trader. Jon 
Mckay runs Canadian trading and is my immediate boss.

I must have missed this one.

It is a 1997 Grand Cherokee Laredo, 55 000 km's, V8 loaded. I think it is 
worth about $25 Grand.

Thanx

Chris

I'm not on either. It is good upside down. I am crazy busy. Did you get the 
"Doesn't really matter.." bit. I am so funny.

Dad,

When are you buying mom a new Jeep? I need to sell my truck and do it fast. I 
was thinking I could trade it in towards mom's new one and that might be the 
best way to get at least decent money for it. Just a thought.

Chris

It doesn't really matter if you don't like the new Janet song. I'm so funny. 
My life is being turned upside down by work but I can't be much more specific 
than that. 

POWER IS JUST AS CRAZY

I HAVE TO GO PUT ON MY RAINBOW WIG AND RED SHOES AND GET BACK TO THE CLOWN 
SHOW!

CD

Where do you get this stuff? Sorry I haven't written back but my world is 
being turned upside down. It is amazing how much your life can change in a 
day. 

more to follow...

I got a tee time for 12:24 on Sunday.

Chris

Writing to confirm your receipt of my account information forms sent by fax. 
I wanted to make sure you had all the information you needed to set up the 
account. Please call me at 403-974-6910 when you have the account number.

Thank you,

I'll be home Friday at 6pm. Dinner sounds great.

Looks like what I thought was happening is happening. Give me a call.

Hey Dad and Chris,

How's it going? I was just wondering if I could ask for you and mom's help on 
a few things before the end of the summer. First, I want to start advertising 
my Jeep for sale, so I was hoping you might spruce it up a bit for me. It 
just needs a good cleaning inside and out (i.e. Lazerwash) before getting its 
picture taken for the ads. Also, the sticker on the rear window should be 
removed and it probably wouldn't hurt to have it Mr. Lubed one more time.

There are a couple of other things, but I think you said not to worry about 
them: Windshield is very cracked and tint on back window has a scrape on it. 
Don't worry about $$$ because whatever it costs you, I'll reimburse you from 
the proceeds.

I was thinking I'll list it in the Red Deer and Calgary Auto/Canada Trader 
magazines. If you call them, they set up an appointment with you to take a 
picture and get the vehicle listed. I have their phone numbers in both Red 
Deer (346-1969) and Cowtown (250-2122), but I think we should get the surfing 
machine tuned up first.

Second, I was hoping I could get a few things sent out here asap. As I 
mentioned before, I want to get involved in some adventurous stuff on the 
weekends, if possible. I found that I can take my Advanced PADI scuba here in 
one weekend, so I was hoping to get my fins, mask, snorkel and booties sent 
out here. I think they are in the basement. 

I would also love to get that box of movies from Chris and my golf 
clubs/shoes, si possible. Don't worry about the golf clubs if they are a 
hastle though b/c I probably wouldn't use them more than once or twice.

I hope this is not a big inconvenience to you guys. I just wanted to get the 
ball rolling on this before the summer's end.

Thanks alot and I'll talk to you soon,

Dan

I talked to Rod he got me a time at 1:21 for Saturday. I'll play with my 
buddies on Saturday. I would like to play with you and mom in Sunday. I'll 
book a tee time if that is OK.

Chris

I would like to golf both days this weekend. Do we have times?

Let me know I can try to book some if Rod hasn't.

Tricia,

I want to exercise some Enron stock options but don't know who I should call. 
Do you have a name and/or phone number of someone? I also don't know what 
information I need to have in order to exercise. Could you give me a call 
(x6910) and help me out. 

Thanx,

Chris Dorland

I was not hung over yesterday. I had 3 beers and went home. How about that 
for self control? I watched women's gymnastics olympic trials on saturday 
night and did some laundry. What a loser I am. I am going to Sylvan this 
weekend. My friend Meghan is moving to Sydney Australia and Saturday is her 
going away party. Meg's cabin parties are  generally epic gong shows. I need 
to rest up this week. I bought in-line pants at the Gap yesterday. Now if I 
get some rollerblades I'll have the official pants. I don't think you need to 
take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week. Can't you do 
it yourself? I could probably even do it and I'm the most mechanically inept 
person in the world.

Chris

Kim,

Can you contact Mikie Rath regarding my 401K plan. I haven't received 
anything from Northern Trust and would like to get set up. I would like begin 
contributing as soon as possible. 

Thanx,

Chris

(PS The way it was explained to me the $10 500 / annum contribution limit is 
only for personal contributions and does not include company matching, is 
this correct?)

We should grab some sushi and talk. Call me at work.

Chris

Are you working this fine Sunday. I am. It has been crazy around here. Mike 
has been out so I've been going 90 mph with my hair on fire. This week should 
be better. I still haven't bought any rollerblades. I've been playing lots of 
squash. How was your week? Gotta watch Tiger now. 

Chris

I told her about it but I don't think she can make it. She called me when she 
was in Calgary yesterday. Call me when you get home.

We have set up a new USERID for you which has all of the same trading rights 
as the old one and is working fine down here. The USERID is ADM40092 and the 
default password on it is "WELCOME6". Just let me know if you have any 
trouble at all with it in the morning. In the meantime, Mark Dilworth and Jay 
Webb are still looking over the old USERID to see what exactly is happening 
with it.

Torrey

Torrey/Mark,

Below is the error message Chris gets when logging in to EOL. If we hit Yes 
it keeps coming back with the same error. (Sometimes it works though... you 
figure it out). If you hit No, the browser session freezes up.

We have done the following:

Please look at this ASAP since he needs to be able to see the customer screen.

The wedding was great! Too much fun. Once again I'm hung over on a monday. No 
great stories except that I nearly wiped out while walking down the aisle. I 
tripped on a cord to a video camera. Mildly embarrassing. My friend was a 
rock. I think I was more nervous than him. Ft. Mac is a total shit hole. On 
my tombstone it wil read " He went to Ft. MacMurray, once."  No Houston for 
me. Thank god. I have to go to a party at my boss's on Saturday. I think I 
might try to play golf as well. I will be taking it very easy. No more booze. 
My liver hurts. 

Chris

Happy belated B-Day! How was the party? I am so tired today. Too much 
driving. I think I set a land speed from Ft. Mac to Calgary yesterday.

Chris

Meg,

Can't wait for the cabin party. Taking my lampshade to the cleaners after 
work.

Chris

I got rewarded for hard work.

No I'm sure it was well within the boundaries of our tolerance policy.

Got some great news today! I'll call you tonight.

Some of my questions. 

What is the difference between the 401K plan and savings plan?

How much does Enron contribute / match for each plan?

What is the max. annual 401k contribution?

Thanx,

Chris

What is your hotmail nickname?

That was very nice. Where do you get this stuff?

Chris

I only like the movies that all the 14 year old kids like.

I don't have my drivers license yet. I start driver's training next week.

Have you ever been to a movie on a Tuesday? I can afford the extra $4 to sit 
in a theater that isn't totally packed with 14 year old kids. The Klumps 
starts at 7:15 at Eau Claire. How does that sound? My friend's wedding is in 
Ft. Mac. That is why I'm going there on thursday. 

I want to go see the klumps. How is tonight? I don't go to movies on 
tuesdays. You are going out wednesday and I leave for Ft. Mac on thursday.

Kelly,

I got you address from an e-mail from Meg and thought I would say hi. How is 
work going? Still in boston? I'm still plugging away at ENE. Buy the stock. 
It's the next CSCO. 

Gotta hop!

w/b

Chris 

I have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my 
buddy's wedding this weekend so I can't go golfing. That sucks. It is so nice 
outside. Maybe I'll work up the energy to go for a run later. Probably not. I 
am such a lazy piece of shit lately. I am definately going to go running now. 
Self depreciation has motivated me. I need to buy some rollerblades. Where 
did you get yours? Cowan says that K2 are really good and relatively 
inexpensive. Any thoughts? Maybe I'll look for rollerblades when I'm out this 
afternoon. You should be proud of me. I was able to stay out of the bottle 
all weekend. Quite an accomplishment don't you think. One hour to go. Someone 
shoot me! 

Chris 

I don't suspose you are working on the beautiful holiday monday but I just 
thought I would say hi. I am so bored! As soon as the Nymex settles I am 
getting out of here.

Chris

Thanx

Chris

Jester 
You are a fag.

Kim,

Thanx for your help with my parking problem. I will contact Louis and 
hopefully he can take care of it. Can you give me a call sometime Tuesday 
afternoon. I have some ?'s about the 401K and savings plans. 

Thanx

I have not forgot about that.  Currently I am working on another 
project(development of a program which will allow automating the process of 
copying multiple postids and update the related info (such as dates and 
expert clause in port_calc) so that user won't have to do that manually on a 
daily basis). 

I'll get back to the report issues after I am done with that.

I am having trouble running new calc's in the test environment.  I want to 
run the implicit position report for our entire book and see how it compares 
to our excel models (post id 834931/836743/839620... anyone will to).  The 
reports I print in Stage are always blank.  I can run calc's using the 
implcit command but I can not print reports on the new postid.

The top page request in an old request but the expicit report request is a 
new one.  I need to be able to look at the positions this way as well as the 
implicit way.

Kathy

BinBin She@ENRON
07/17/2000 03:58 PM
Kathy,

The port_calc  version you have now when run from the port_calc screen in the 
egsstage environment doesn't include the changes for the "Implicit reports" 
related functionalities. This is because the current setup is for a testing 
version which is being used by the Houston currently.

To solve this problem, we have just put a run script : 
/home/kreeve/port_calc/run_implcit in your directory: /home/kreeve/port_cal.

For the testing, cd to /home/kreeve/port_cal,  then run the script:  
run_implcit  postid (you need to set up a postid for the test run).

To get the reports, you can still use the port_calc screen brought up in the 
egsstage environment (you can bring it up by typing: runmt on the command 
line)

postid 747584 is still available in the production environment, to run the 
test version of port_calc in egsstage, you need to have a data set in the 
egsstage database.

By the way, Are the issues you attatched in the reports(explici report and 
top page report) new requests ?

Please see the attached issues regarding the reports.

Also, under esggsate I can not seem to bring up only old calc's (including 
747584), in order to copy/amend them.  I need to test other types of deals so 
I need to be able to bring things up postid's in portcalc.  Any ideas what 
might be wrong?  Note that I can print reports from the reportscreen.

Brad Gabrielson <bgabrielson@cdnam.com> on 08/02/2000 08:00:26 PM
   My name is Bob, and I am Canadian.

   I am a minority in Vancouver, Banff, and every casino in this country.

   I was born in 1972, yet I am responsible for some Native's great great
   grandfather who screwed himself out of his land in the 1800's.

   I pay import tax on cars made in Ontario.

   I am allowed to skydive and smoke, but not allowed to drive without a
   seat belt.

   All the money I make up until mid July must go to paying taxes.

   I live and work among people who believe Americans are ignorant.

   These same people cannot name this country's new Territory.

   Although I am sometimes forced to live on Kraft Dinner and don't have a
   pot to piss in, I sleep well knowing that I've helped purchase a nice
six
   figure home in Vancouver for some unskilled Chinese refugee.

   Although they are unpatriotic and constantly try to separate, Quebec
   still  provides my nation's Prime Ministers.

   95% of my nation's international conflicts are over fish.

   I'm supposed to call black people African Canadians, although I'm sure
   none of them have ever been to Africa, or east of Halifax for that
matter.

   I believe that paying a 200% tax on alcohol is fair.

   I believe that same tax on gasoline is also fair.

   Even if I have no idea what happened to that old rifle my grandfather
   gave me when I was 14, I will be considered a criminal if I don't
register
   it.

   I DO know Jeff from Toronto.

   I often badmouth the United States, and then vacation there three times
   a year.

   I'm led to believe that some lazy ass unionized broom pusher who makes
   $30 an hour is underpaid and therefore must go on strike, but paying $10
an
   hour to someone who works 12 hour shifts at forty below on an oil rig is
fair.

   I believe that paying $30 million for 3 stripes (The Voice of Fire) by
   the National Art Gallery was a good purchase, even though 99% of this
   country didn't want it, or will ever see it.

   When I look at my pay stub and realize that I take home a third of what
   I actually make, I say "Oh well, at least we have better health care
than
   the Americans"

   It must bail out farmers when their crops are too wet or too dry,
   because I control the rain.

   My National Anthem has versions in both official  languages, and I don't
   know either of them.

   Canada is the highest taxed nation in North America, the biggest
   military buffer for the United States, and the number one destination
  for fleeing boat people.

   I am not an angry white male.  I am an angry broke taxpayer.

   My name is Bob, and I am Canadian

The stag was a total monkey show. We played golf and pool, ate some dinner, 
took in the ballet and the hit the bars. I did manage to get a couple of 
rounds of golf in between all the drinking. I actually played pretty good. 
Houseboating sounds like fun. I've never done that. I am so on the wagon. I 
can't express to you how little I'm going to drink this weekend. Lots of 
golf. 

Enron Corp. up 1 5/8

What questions? I accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don't 
remember any questions. I hadn't seen the jokes before but they were pretty 
funny. The sports ones were pretty good. The others were pretty tasteless, so 
they were my favorites. I feel much better today. I'm already getting psyched 
up for the weekend. I am going to play golf and not drink. I hate alcohol. I 
am on the wagon. For good this time. At least for a week anyway.

Chris

When you have them ready could you give me the reversals for this month 
please.

Thanx

Dianne,

Do you have our index positions for September ready yet?

How was your holiday? You missed some beautiful weather. My best friend's 
stag was on saturday and I still feel like shit. I guess I deserve it for 
drinking 200 beers. From what I recall I had a good time though. Tonight I am 
going to bed at 8pm. I can't wait.

Chris

How did the pattened move work?

cd

I will be able to attend Milly's party.

Saturday was really fun. Golf was great. Mike and Andrew's group was by far 
the drunkest foursome. Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to 
play pool. That is when things got out of hand. We got Ryan a bright yellow 
T-shirt with "NOBODY KNOWS I'M A LESBIAN" written in big block letters. Call 
me tonight and I'll give you all the gory details. My head still hurts.     

Five years out of any particular date?

Not bad....

"Mr. Launer's tip for investors who don't have the time to do exhaustive
research: Look for companies such as Enron and El Paso whose stocks are
trading at price-earnings multiples that are lower than their long-term growth
rates."

The one thing that scares me about Enron is the P/E, regardless of earnings 
growth. Our earnings growth has been so strong it is like a treadmill that 
keeps getting faster and faster. At some point you fall on your ass. That 
being said, I have never sold a share of Enron stock or exercised an option. 
We always seem to find ways to reinvent ourselves and make money appear from 
nowhere. Investment in Enron should be treated with the same caution as 
investing in Cisco or any other new economy stock that challenges traditional 
valuation methods.

How are you doing? Did you have a good stampede? I had a great stampede but 
got a nasty cold. Work is going good. Do you know Ryan Flemming? He went to 
Riverglen and is a pretty good friend of mine. Anyway, he is getting married 
August 12 so I've been pretty busy organizing his stag and getting ready for 
his wedding. Went to Red Deer this weekend and saw my parents. Did you know 
my brother moved to Toronto? I need to find a smaller place but for now I'm 
staying in Kensington. That is all that is new in my life. We should hit a 
patio and have a drink one night. 

Take it easy,

Chris 

Jay,

I can't seem to suspend my product without hitting the stop sign with the

Let me know if anyone of you is interested in getting one...
One of my friends has started his importing business selling handfree kits
for mobile phones.  Basically, this new product from Turkey can work with
Ericission, Motorola, Nokia and all kind of mobile phones including any new
WAP phones.  As a promotion item it costs only $2 each with limited stock
available.  For your reference, I've attached a picture showing the product.

Please let me know if you would like to buy one

I never get any good jokes which is why I haven't been sharing any. I am 
having a shitting week. Sick and tired. I can't wait for the weekend. I am 
going to sleep and golf. Where are you going on vacation? There aren't many 
weekends left in the summer and that sucks! Out of the weekends that are left 
I have two weddings and one stag, a trip to Houston and a trip to Toronto. I 
am never going to play any golf.

gotta hop

Rod,

Thanx for booking those tee times. I will be playing on saturday and I am 
going to get either Mike or Brad to join us if that is OK.

Chris

(Are you guys golfing on Sunday? I booked a time for 11:52)

Sorry I haven't responded. I left early yesterday and have been big time busy 
today. I am still pretty sick. 

I'll write back soon.

Do you have any plans for July 29th? If not, would you like to come to Ryan's 
stag? You could play golf with Darryl Brown, Ryan's dad and their friend Dave.
I think those guys are going to play golf and then come to dinner afterwards. 
Let me know either way.

Chris

Dawn,

How long does it usually take Blue Cross to refund $ for the flexible 
spending account? I sent in a claim form a month ago and haven't seen 
anything yet. The reason I'm concerned is that when my brother moved he did a 
change of address and my mail has been screwed up ever since.

Thanx,

Chris

Today I'm leaving by 5. Usually by 5:30-6. Et vous?

I can't just sit here and write e-mails all day. I'm a busy man. I did not 
mean to offend you. I had smoozing to do and didn't want to neglect our 
customers. 

That was not a snub. I was being sneaky...

Just so you know we are expecting the coldest weather in 4-5 years to hit 
Alberta this weekend and next week. Temps of -40 celcius are not out of the 
question.

How was your final stampede weekend? I have a cold so I layed pretty low this 
weekend. Did your friend have a good time? 

w/b

cd

How's it going? Hear you are working pretty crazy hours. Went to NN with the 
boys on Saturday and played golf in Kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good 
weekend. I have a post stampede cold so I won't be doing much other than work 
and sleep for a few days. Take it easy and write back when you get a minute.

Chris

Go buy Independence Day on DVD.

And you are moching me for peace out..

I thought you would like that. We've been working the homeboy language in the 
broker market all week. You diss'n me? I'll bust a cap in your ass.

I was wondering why I wasn't getting any mail. Could  you please send me that 
stuff through intercompany mail. I need to pay that insurance bill soon. If 
they can't straighten it out I'll send you your mail a couple times a week 
through inter-company mail.

Peace out!

That's fine. I'll be home all night.

The have Mike's Hard and stuff like that. I generally never go out during the 
week. I was home by 7pm yesterday but I am an enormous baby when it comes to 
hangovers. I'm not going to the rodeo on Friday but I am going to the chucks 
that night. Tonight I rest. 

Kim,

I am getting parking deducted twice from my pay check. Who do I contact to 
straighten that out?

Thanx

Chris

How are things going? Learning lots? Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville 
North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today. I'm not doing anything today 
but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that 
should be good for a headache. Friday I'm going to the Chick Wagon party and 
Saturday to Nashville North with the boys. Weather has been good and looks 
like that will continue. Did you find a gym yet?

w/b

Chris

Today my head hurts. I don't know where our seats at the rodeo are. Yesterday 
they were at the north end of the infield but I have no idea where they are 
for tommorow. A word to the wise, avoid the draft beer at the rodeo. I 
contains rat poison. 

I do not suck at writing e-mails. You just can't appreciate the sense of 
humor one develops in my line of work. It's borderline madness. I should be 
home all night but do call first  in case I'm outside working in the garden.

Perhaps...

When I think of sunnies I think of those little glasses you wear in tanning 
beds. Your sunglasses are fine. I wore them while I was hangin' around the 
house last night. My neighbors think I am a total freak. Maybe it wasn't the 
sunglasses but the "Sweatin' to the Oldies" I was blaring on my stereo all 
night . I think Richard Simmons is a totally misunderstood genius. I am so 
bored. I'm going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good. Better 
get back to doing NOTHING!

cd 

How is your wounded eye? 

Lavorato never let his people put their titles on business cards until they 
became managers. It doesn't really matter. I never really understood why he 
cared. I think they look more professional with titles. You should ask Jan.

Chris

You are paranoid.

Just Laird, Blair, Perry, Tony and a couple of guys around here. Is that a 
problem? 

I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday. It is the Enron customer party that 
day. As for Nashville North I don't know if we are going there or somewhere 
else after. I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school 
nights. I likely won't be going out again until Friday or Saturday. Am I 
going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around 
town? I hope not. Chicks dig me in those glasses.

I had to flee to Houston. 

cd

I was just kidding. How desperately do you need them? Tonight I will be 
around in the evening. If you are lucky I might even buy you a cup of coffee.

I'll bring them by your office this afternoon.

NO

What is your work phone number?

Hope work is going well. Dusting off my cowboy hat and going stampeding 
tomorrow. I'll try to give you a call tonight or on the weekend.

Say hi to MH and Wilson and Charlene.

Chris

Are you guys still going to desperados (SP?) tommorow?

I think I'm going to head there at about 3PM with Rob Laird and Blair 
McDermott (you know Blair... the guy with the huge...)

w/b

Chris

Could you teach my brother how to use his e-mail? 

Thanx

Dorland

How goes day #1 in TO? Did you get everything straightened out with the 
movers? It is pouring rain and 9 celcius here. 

Keep it real.

Chris 

Can you come and see me when you get in. We need to do more to tie out the 
risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long 
or short. My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile. We 
need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie 
out. If that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it. 
Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups.

Thanx,

I'm done!

I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading. I have to set up the 
economics page but that shouldn't take long.

What about reversals from our currency book? Which way do the reversals from 
the other books go?

The cash deals aren't all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physical 
position doesn't balance but I will talk to Mike about that.

I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully this makes things 
easier on you.

Thanx for all your hard work!

You might want to watch out while you're crossing the street.

I sent it to him.

Yo Mama`s so fat ....

Your mama is so fat:
When she hauls ass she has to make two trips.
When she dances she makes the band skip.
When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her

13 years to live.

She puts mayonnaise on aspirin. (<- clearly the winner)
Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard.
When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts.
Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph.
Her driver`s license says "Picture continued on other side."
She has to iron her pants on the driveway.
The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.
Yo mama`s so fat, all the restaurants in town have signs that say:
"Maximum Occupancy: 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama"
Yo mama`s so fat, when she ran away, they had to use all four sides of
the milk carton.
Yo mama`s so fat, instead of Levis 501 jeans, she wears Levi`s 1002`s.
Yo mama`s so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it HAS to go down.
Yo mama`s so fat, she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth.
Yo mama`s so fat, she`s got smaller fat women orbiting around her.
Yo mama`s so fat, she could sell shade.

When are you coming?

Why is the Analyst / Associate program excluded from the referral incentive

I am sorry I was short with you on the phone. The gas market is a total shit

and I am very tired. We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some 
steaks on Saturday after golf. Danny and I can leave after dinner or first 
thing in the morning on Sunday. I hope your (and my) work week improves. See 
you tommorow!

Expect a call from Paul tonight.

What are some good interview questions? Poll your co-workers.

I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want 
to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis. I told him I told 
you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say. He said they are 
looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality.

Don't take that deal out until I look at it. I think it is mine but I forgot 
to write it in the blue FX book (I only wrote it in my red book).

Paul called me today. He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will 
interview you then.

Give me a call Tuesday afternoon to discuss (gone to Kelowna golfing for the 
weekend).

Cheers,

Wednesday at 3:30 in the computer training room downstairs. The focus of the

Sumas to La Plata B and PGT Kingsgate to Malin).

Everyone is welcome. Free hotdogs and donuts for the first 100 customers! 
Bring the kids, we've got fun for the whole family.

The short description for the above product should read CAN Gas Swap Nit

Hey buddy,

 What were you doing in Mexico?  Must have been really nice!  As far
as tomorrow is concerned, I think that we may have a few drinks before the
club scene, so you are more than welcome to stop over for a few. I would love
to introduce you to some of my "single" friends.  Actually, pretty much all
of them are single right now. (Teehee). Anyhow, I imagine that we will begin
at about 8 or so, hope to see ya there. I live in Marda Loop in the SW. It's
just off off Crowchild. My address is #2, 2106, 35th ave SW. Exit onto 33rd,
and it's easy from there. If you have any ques'ns, call me @ 249-1571.
Depending on which way you come, it is really easy to find. You can also get
there by 14th, or 17th, but in either case, you will still turn onto 33rd.
Talk to you soon!
T

Tasha,

Back from Mexico. It was a much needed rest. Saturday sounds great but I 
might only be able to stop by for the first part of the evening. Some friends 
are having a house warming and I said I would stop by there as well. Send me 
the details.

Hello,

I can't imagine how dark you guys are. Hope you are soaking up your last 
couple of days. Have a cubra libra for me!

I'll give them to Bugg. I will help move.

I have 2 incredible tickets for the Brooks and Dunn concert on Friday. Do you 
want them?

Scott,

When checking my FX new deals please make sure the following are entered in 
my model correctly:

Settlement Date
FX Rate
Dollar amount (All deals are entered from a US dollar perspective)
Direction (buy/sell)

Thanx,

Chris

Are you guys looking to hire any analysts for the Toronto office? 

I know someone I think would be a good fit. Let me know.

Chris

Howard,

I filled the Energywest order at -0.36 for May basis.

You made $0.015 us/mm

Chris

See me to make sure I wrote it in properly

I made it home. The flight was OK. Shitty movies.

I am very tired today. Tough getting going this morning.

Better get going. Enjoy the rest of your vacation.

Love,

Chris

Kathy,

Could you run a report that lists all of the FX hedges in our book. I just 
want to make sure we aren't missing any deals in our model.

Thanx,

Chris

Tasha.

Good to hear from you. I have been quite busy. I am out of town all of next 
week but we should get together some time.
In terms of careers I don't have much in the way of ideas. Have you thiught 
about sales of some sort. I think you would be good at that. Not necessarily 
business to consumer sales but perhaps business to business sales. Just a 
thought. 

w/b

Chris

Dan,

I need a ride to go get Mom's Jeep sometime tonight.

Give me a call or write back.

Chris

Just a note to let you know we have changed our fee structure with NGX. 

As of April 1, we are no longer paying any fee for deals beyond the prompt 
month.

Thanx,

Chris

Dan

Just a reminder to order an attachment for my phone.

Chris

Varsity called and the water pump needs to be replaced. 

It is going to be $700. I told them to go ahead and fix it.

Hope that's OK.

Chris

That is some funny shit!

Enron Teams With  Compaq to Provide Capacity for One Million Simultaneous 
Broadband Streams of  Windows Media Player
10:55 EDT Monday, April 10, 2000

    HOUSTON, April 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Broadband Services, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) and a leader in the delivery of
high bandwidth applications, announced today an alliance with Compaq, the
largest supplier of computer systems in the world, to enable Microsoft Windows
Media solutions over Enron's fiber optic high-bandwidth network.
    With this agreement, the Enron Intelligent Network(TM) and distributed
Compaq ProLiant servers will provide unprecedented levels of performance and
quality of service for Windows Media applications.  The Enron Intelligent
Network offers high quality of service, reliability and network control for
the delivery of TV-quality streaming video to the fastest growing media
customer base -- broadband Internet users.
    Enron and Compaq have teamed to make this breakthrough in video quality
easy for broadcasters and content providers to enhance the Internet experience
for their customers.  In live demonstrations this week at the National
Association of Broadcasters' show in Las Vegas, NAB 2000, the companies will
showcase how their combined technologies make this possible.
    Enron's video streaming services and the Enron Intelligent Network
optimize Media Player for broadband content, and Enron has selected Compaq as
the preferred platform for Windows Media Server.  As a part of Compaq's
NonStop(TM) eBusiness solutions strategy, Compaq Professional Services is
partnering with Enron to provide a wide range of systems integration services
in conjunction with the newly formed alliance.
    "We are pushing the technology envelope and setting new standards daily,"
said Joe Hirko, CEO of Enron Broadband Services.  "To ensure a highly
reliable, scalable, industrial-strength network on an ongoing basis, Enron's
distributed infrastructure design is continually evolving.  This requires a
regimen of testing and benchmarking.  Compaq has been an invaluable, trusted
partner in helping us further extend Enron's multiplatform capabilities."
    Compaq and Enron engineering teams worked together to simulate the high
volume loads of a live streaming media web event with as many as 10,000 users
streaming broadband Windows Media from a single ProLiant server farm.  They
then translated the results into the Compaq architecture and system design for
Enron's network and collaborated on product testing, quality control and
deployment.
    "Broadband applications are here now and represent a rapidly growing
requirement from Compaq's service provider and enterprise customers," said
Ashok Shah, Vice President North America, Compaq Professional Services.  "We
are pleased to be working with Enron on next generation broadband application
design and delivery in media and entertainment, as well as in areas such as
distance learning, health care and multimedia customer centers.  Enron is an
important reference to our 27,000 Compaq services professionals as we provide
technology leadership and expertise to our client engagements."
    Enron and Compaq will work together to implement Microsoft Windows 
2000internally as well as in product development for future product 
iterations.
The two organizations will collaborate on the development of strategy and best
practices for large-scale, high-volume Windows Media applications and
deployments for service providers and enterprise customers.  Additionally,
Enron will team with Compaq to provide high-bandwidth capability for Compaq
customers.

No problem.

The walk to work in the snow was invigorating at 6:45. Just kidding, it 
wasn't that bad.

Big news around here today. Lavo is moving to Houston.

Chris

I accidentally entered a X-Alta storage deal twice on Friday. I have already 
taken it out of our model it now needs to be killed in Tagg and Sitara.

The Tagg deal # is NE4430.

Let me know if there are any problems.

Thanx,

Chris

Dad,

I really think you should think about getting in on this 360 networks deal. 
Even if only a small piece. 

I would take a piece.

Talk to you about it on the weekend.

Chris

Lavo is going to bring it in for me. 

I bought QQQ today at 93. Traded 102 in afterhours trading on the island.

Enron is free.

Chris

Did you notice the stock market is a little lower today. The fucking nasdaq 
is down 10 % today and the dow  was down almost 5% at one point. The TSE was 
down 770 to 8880 at one point. I think that a lot of margin positions got 
squeezed out of teck length. I say buy the solid stocks CSCO, LU , MSFT, ENE 
all look great.

Chris

Dad,

Looks like you were smart to wait to get into this market. It has done 
nothing but go straight down today.

Chris

Kathy,

Aquila accidentally traded my financial product instead of my physical 
product. Could you change the financial deal they did to phys?

I buy 5000 from Aquila at 3.645 for May.

Thanx,

Chris

level.

Check out MSFT. Getting the shit kicked out of it.

Kathy,

Could you run a mini-book of all the deals in my FX book as of today. I am 
setting up a new model and want to double check that I have all the correct 
deals.

Thanx,

Chris

It's great that your coming to Calgary to study for a couple of months. 
You'll have to work extra hard in June so you can kick back during Stampede. 
Things here are pretty much unchanged. Working quite a bit and doing a little 
snowboarding and beer drinking on the weekends. Things could definately be 
worse. Going golfing in Playa del Carmen in a couple of weeks. That should be 
fun. Looking forward to chilling out by the pool for a week and doing 
nothing. This year has been a roller coaster ride for my trading profits and 
I need a break. Met a really cool girl recently. Will advise if anything 
interesting devolops there. It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have no 
idea why I am at work. I think I'm going to go to the driving range. Take it 
easy and w/b!

CD

I am going to stay in Calgary tonight. 

I am getting a massage tommorow and need to go tanning. I also have some 
errands to run. 

Dan and I might come back saturday afternoon.

What are you guys up to ?

w/b

Dear Ann Landers:

I am a sailor in the merchant navy. My parents live in Mississauga and one
of my sisters, who lives in Toronto, is married to a natural gas trader from
Calgary. My Father and Mother have recently been arrested for growing and
selling marijuana and are currently dependent on my two sisters, who are
prostitutes. I have two brothers, one who is currently serving a life
sentence in a Winnipeg prison for the rape & murder of a teenage boy in
1994, the other is currently being held in the Kingston jail on remand for
charges of incest with  his three children.

I have recently become engaged to marry a former Thai prostitute who indeed
is still a part time "working girl" in a brothel, however, her time there is
limited as she has recently been infected with an STD. We intend to marry as
soon as possible and are currently looking into the possibility of opening
our own brothel with my fianc, utilising her knowledge of the industry
working as the manager. I am hoping my two sisters would be interested in
joining our team. Although I would prefer them not to prostitute themselves,
it would at least get them off the streets and hopefully the heroin.

My problem is this: I love my fianc, and look forward to bringing her into
the family and of course I want to be totally honest with her.

Should I tell her about my brother-in-law being a gas trader?

THE TECH SECTOR IS GETTING THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF IT.

I DON'T HAVE ANY MO, UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT XEROX!

YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF THE MARKET.

NORTEL IS DOWN $19 / SHARE

CHRIS

Dan this is Chris. 

I case you have forgotten I am the short guy that sits between Cowan and 
Lavo. 

Just wondering how my SDI direct line is coming.

Just kidding!

Call me

Scott,

I think your EOL report was incorrect regarding the Henry Hub gas daily deals 
from Mar.28th.

Mike and I had a total of 3 sales at 2.945

2 done by Mike

EOL ID #'s
132116
132569

and 1 done by me

EOL ID #
132967

The trade I did was done late in the day and you might have missed it.

We added the deal back to our model. 

Let me know if there are any problems.

Chris

How's your day going?

Have a look in your humidor tonight. I brought you 13 Monte Cristo #4's ( I 
got a great deal). 

When I put them in there I noticed that you humidor seemed a little dry you 
might want to fill it up.

2 1/2 weeks to Mexico.

Chris

Jill,

Just dropping a note to say hi!

Will write more soon.

Chris

Anne,

According to the people at the PEP help desk I don't exist. Maybe that's why 
I don't get mail or paystubs? 

Chris Dorland

Dan,

How is my SDI direct line coming?

Chris

Dianne,

I didn't get my spreadsheet from Friday. No biggie I just used the average of 
my buy and sell from stack manager in my model but I would like to have the 
actual deals.

Thanx,

Chris 

Kramer,

I'm going to sunny Mexico on April 16th but we should get together for a beer 
before you go to Banff on the Friday.

Herc

How is my SDI direct line coming?

Chris

John,

The credit contact at TXU is Chris Papousek 713-210-5085.

Thanx,

Chris

John,

I need a response on this issue. 

Chris

John,

Where are we at on credit with these guys. 

They won't sell me gas because they say we need to increase Enron Canada's 
parental guarentee.

This is costing me deals and I need to know what is going on soon.

Thanx,

Chris 

Lon,

The last couple of days the April basis market on our morning sheet has been 
the financial curve rather than the physical.

We should use the physical curve for the prompt month comparison analysis as 
it is more relevant as the index gets set.

Thanx,

Chris

Kathy,

Could you run a NX1 / NX3 report for our book.

Thanx,

Chris

Dad,

Canadian 88 up $0.25 to $2.05

Hey there Mr. Fancy! How would you feel about doing some golfing this 
weekend? Give me a shout.

Chris

w 713-853-1663
h 713-588-5131

Dad,

Apparently Duke Energy injected 50 Million of cash into Canadian 88. Greg 
Novall has been replaced as President and CEO.

Chris

This file contains a list of FX swaps that need to be transfered from Lavo's 
currency book to our new currency book. 

Once the deals have been transferred the corresponding annuities need to be 
killed from Lavo's and our financial books.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanx,

Chris

New plan.

Staying in Calgary.

Want to go to Earl's?

Call Me!

Call me. 

Mike talked me into going back to Red Deer.

Chris

I don't care what we do. I am going to go for a couple of drinks after work 
but nothing out of hand.

Mike called me and said he wanted to hook up with Johnny tonight. I don't 
really want to go back to Red Deer to go out.  

Give me a call at work.

Chris

Thanx

I guess the question is whether the cost of pending lawsuits is priced into 
the stock? 

I see an RJR Nabisco deal here. Break off Miller and Kraft and let the death 
merchant division die slowly.

Chris

Dan,

Could you set up my SDI direct line on my turrett today please.

Chris

Rod,

Any thoughts on Phillip Morris ?

6.35 X Earnings

How bad can you do?

Chris

DAN,

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY IS 1663

DID YOU BUY ANY ?

CHRIS

Scott,

The ROM gas daily deal that I did with IM-Central-Transport on Friday appears 
to be booked backwards. The trader from Houston called me this morning.

The deal # is NB9860.1. Could you see that it is booked properly. 

Thanx,

Chris

Anne,

I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I 
get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company 
mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't 
received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird. 

Thanx 

Chris Dorland

(P.S. thanx for the PRC info.)

Call me at work.

Chris

There continues to be confusion concerning the Premstar deals. Can you come 
see me when you get in.

Chris

BUGG,

DO YOU HAVE AN E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR MIKE KRUEGER?

DORLAND

I am organizing a bachelor party and am interested in information on group 
rates and facility availability. 

Our group will require 5-7 tee times, dinner and cocktails. I am hoping to 
book for one of the following Saturdays:

June 24, 2000
July 8, 2000
July 15, 2000
July 22, 2000

Information on transportation to Red Deer would also be appreciated.

Thank you!

Chris

Kathy,

Could we sit down for about a half an hour this afternoon. I Have some 
questions about how our new FX book is going to work and how to transfer 
current positions into this book.

Let me know when you have a few minutes ( any time after 2pm).

Chris

Kathy,

Could you find out what the breakdown between the $CND and $US monthly index 
positions transfer to our book were for the month of March. 

I just want to double check that it is being represented properly in our 
currency positions.

Thanx,

Heard through Bugg your in SF now. You should rethink coming up to Kelowna 
for May long. 

Thinking of going to the bay area to visit some friends sometime soon. Send

Any good stock ideas? Check out MSIA on the Nasdaq OTC board. This could be a

Mike,

How are things going? I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily. 

Things have been relatively quiet lately. Doing a little snowboarding and 
watching lots of movies. Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 
days a week. So far I'm at one in a row. Things are looking good for a repeat

Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office. For all 
your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum 
now.
I think Lambie helped them out there.

Take care,

Call me at Mom and Dad's on Saturday and I'll pop down and see you at work.

What date do I need to get you the money by?

I am going to Red Deer this weekend.

Chris

Howdie,

What's the new job? I'm good for sushi any day next week (Tues-Fri). Give me 
a call or e-mail me. 

I'm off to Kimberly snowboarding this weekend. I've done some good 
snowboarding trips lately (Lake Tahoe and Fernie).

Not making big $$$$$ lately but things are looking up. Going to Santa Fe 
grill for lunch (mmmm!).

You need to come check out my new home theater system, it's crazy!

See you next week,

Chris

Please don't change any deals until we have spoken. I need to talk to John 
about how these changes will affect his positions.

Chris

Mike,

Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats 
are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.

Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good 
friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy 
casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the 
weekend. 

Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very 
choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look 
for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.

You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I 
think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure. Also try Ranoush 
Juice for a falafel.

Good luck and keep in touch!

Chris

Not having to add products (ie. Hub cash) to our composite pages everyday

Congratulations!  For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been 
ranked the "Most Innovative Company in America" by Fortune magazine.  In 
addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in "Quality of 
Management," topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our "Employee 
Talent" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco 
Systems.   America's most admired management team is paired with the best and 
brightest employee talent.  That winning combination has led to Enron's 
five-year "Most Innovative" sweep.  The "Most Admired" list will appear in 
Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8.

You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition.  You bring 
the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities.  You 
contribute to our quality management team.  And you are the outstanding 
employee talent that makes Enron such an exciting and successful company.

Keep up your outstanding work, and we look forward to even greater 
achievements in 2000! 

Brad,

Could you e-mail me your mailing address so I can send off a cheque. 

Please make sure I've maximized my foreign content as I don't love the TSE at

Good to hear you arrived safely. Reno was very average. Too much travel. I 
guess you know all about that.

Hope that work is going well. I am trying to take it relatively easy on Rob.  
Benson's email is Rob.Benson@enron.com, if that doesn't work try

Robert.Benson@enron.com. Let me know if those don't work.

Gotta hop! 

Keep in touch,

Brad,

Just thinking about my RRSP's. I want to make sure I have maximized my 
contributions.

Jeremy,
In the last few months our intramonth books have seen very large swings in 
their P&L due simply to currency positions.  The traders want to be able to 
hedge this risk but the problem is that there are no reports in ERMS that 
meet their currency information requirements.

We need reports similar to those reports which we are able to produce for our 
term books

Crv Shift (Implicit)  - to show price curve shift by pub code
Curr Hedge   - to show currency curveshift by month
Implicit Position Report  - to show gas and USD positions by month
Top Page Canada  - to correctly bucket price curveshift verses currency 
curveshift

We need these reports to work for all of our intramonth books (physical, 
financial, gas daily).  

physical postids:  accued: 698871, MTM: 698872
financial postid:     698876
gas daily:   698877

All of these reports currently work for our term books (698669) but none of 
our intramonth books (there reports come out blank)

This issue  is of CRITICAL importance to us - our IM book is seeing 
SIGNIFICANT swings in p&l due to currency exposure.  We had originally asked 
for currency reports from you approx 6 months ago (requested by Walt).  We 
now need this ASAP.

The most important IM book which we need reports for is the IM financial book 
and the most important report we need in the Implicit Position Report.
I understand that this will take a considerable amout of your time but this 
is VERY important to the profitability of Enron Canada.  Please call be to 
dicuss a timeline.  

Kathy (403-974-6735)

Hi Andrew!

How are things in London? I am talking to MH right now and he says you are 
getting a little tired of school. I don't blame you one bit.

I need a vacation. I bet you do to. What do you say to a little Amsterdam 
trip in April? I think we deserve it. 

What do you think of MH changing companies? I think he should get out of that 
business altogether. He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months.

Take care,

Chris

Just thought I'd send a quick note to keep in touch and let you know what
I've been up to.  This is a picture from one of my first assignments in
March of last year during spring break in Panama City Fl.  The nice young
lady in the picture is, along with all of the other "competitors", wearing a
BIGWORDS T-Shirt.  Wilson, I'll defer to Grump for a joke.

My next assignment is the national cheerleading championships in Orlando Fl
in two weeks.

Hope everything is going well for you guys,
Talk to you later.

Kramer, 

Cowan is trading Alberta cash and I'm trading the front of the curve. Lavo 
still trades the term in Alberta but is never around. As for Benny, after an 
unfortunate incident at September's craw fish boil, he has moved to Houston 
to trade power. No shit! 

Drop me a line with a number where you can be reached. I have an idea, like 
everyone else in the world, for an internet start up and want to pick your 
brain about the process of doing a business plan, getting VC $'s and such. I 
don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be 
greatly appreciated. I have a friend in the Internet group at Goldman Sach's 
and I've talked to him about it but I want insight from someone inside the 
industry.

There is a revolution going on and I think I am the only one not getting rich 
off of it. 

Check out enron stock (ENE). We announced an alliance with Sun Microsystems 
to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month. Not bad 
for a small Texas pipeline company. You would need a sand blaster to get the 
smile off of Lavorato's face. However I don't think I'm going to retire on my 
Enron options any time soon.

Gotta hop!

one that I'm surprised is still supported (cdorlan@ect.enron.com).

(Like you will every see a $ from this!)

Kramer,

How are things going? We are thinking of coming to SF on a golf / party trip 
sometime in the  next few months.

Things in Calgary are relatively unchanged. No chicks. Work is going great. 
Cowan and I are trading Alberta and having a great time. 

Poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here. I 
am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics.

Take it easy and w/b,

Dorland

Chris,

The purchase agreement is on its way over today but I would like to
confirm our plans.  NGTL will buy 50 Tj per day from Enron January 17 to
24, and 15 Tj on January 25 to complete the purchase for a total of 415
Tj.  We are flexible but I need like to lay out a schedule in advance.

Have a good week-end and feel free to call me (541-4726) if there are
any questions.

Andrew,

Nice to hear from you. Hope all is well in the UK. The millenium came and 
went and I think I had a good time. 

I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML. Good for him. That 
is a shit business with no future. The broker is the buggy whip of the 
financial 

services industry. 

I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to 
visit. I have to run but I'll keep in touch.

Take care,

Chris

Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst. I had 
about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer 
between Friday and this morning.

Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all 
I know. 

Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing 
happen to him last week.

Happy Anniversary! I will deliver the card in person in about 10 days.

this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you 
some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our 
analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some 
goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week 
works for you.

Hey Chris,

I am doing some research on historical prices in surrounding power markets 
and I am trying to determine the wholesale market-opening dates for NE power 
markets. I am also interested in dates when locational marginal pricing (LMP) 
was implemented (if at all).

I was able to get dates for every market but Cinergy and ECAR. Please let me 
know if you can tell me who to contact, and/or if someone in Houston can dig 
this up for me.

I don't mean to be a burden, but Jeff Borg was hoping I could come up with 
this for a 3:00pm meeting today.

Thanks bro,

I would like the following data (and anything else you can think of):

Daily Power Prices

- PJM West / East (Others?)
- NYPP  
- Cinergy
-TVA
- any other markets that you think are relevant

Temperatures (Max, Min, Mean)

- Philadelphia
- Allentown
- Pittsburg
- Washington DC
- Newark
- Baltimore
- NYC

Gas Prices

- Transco Zone 6 Non- NY and NY
- What other pipes are close to the above cities? 

Supply (Generation)

- Any information you have on generation in PJM (by plant) including:
 - Fuel type
 - Capacity (typical production vs. maximum production)
 - Efficiency (heat rates) / Marginal production costs 
 - Historic outages
 - Forecast Outages
 - Who owns / operates the facilities?
 - Reserves ?
(I am trying to understand what the supply curve for PJM looks like but I am 
not sure if I am asking the correct questions. What parts of the puzzle am I 
missing?)

Demand (Load)

- Historic load information for PJM

Interchanges

- What are the historic imports and exports in and out of PJM
- What are the costs associated with wheeling power in and out of PJM ? 

Thank you for all your help and please include any other info. you think may 
be relevant.

Margaret,

Just wondering how my Visa was coming along? I had a confusing conversation 
with Jeanne in relocation services this morning. The way I understand the 
moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same 
time or after I leave the country. She seemed to think that I had to go to 
the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada. Can you 
shed some light on this?

Thanx,

I talked to Keith Holst who went through this process a couple of years ago 
and he said that a lady named Janice Priddy in Houston set up the paperwork 
for him.

Enron lived 'on edge - sex, money, all of it' 
The rise and fall of Houston decadence
Philip Delves Broughton 
The Daily Telegraph, with files from news services 
HOUSTON - Enron was a company in love with itself. Office affairs were rampant, divorce among senior executives an epidemic and stories of couples steaming up glass-walled offices after late-night meetings were the talk of Houston.
"It was insane," says a former energy trader, soothing her financial injuries with a margarita.
"There were no rules for people, even in our personal lives. Everything was about the company and everything was supposed to be on the edge -- sex, money, all of it."
The music has suddenly stopped. The startling demise of the energy giant has wiped out savings and pensions, destroyed careers and dragged the U.S. version of free-market capitalism into the interrogation room.
The reverberations of Enron's collapse will be felt for years in Washington and on Wall Street, but nowhere more than in Houston, the stage for Enron's gaudy act. From the mid-1980s, when Enron was created by the merger of two energy companies, Houston became its town. The company filled the void left by the oil companies, whose buccaneering days had ended with the collapse in oil prices.
In River Oaks, the most exclusive suburb of Houston, Enron executives began building huge mansions. Jeff Skilling, the executive who transformed Enron under the more genteel rule of Ken Lay, the former chief executive, decorated his house in black and white, Enron's corporate colours, from the marble to the sofas to the flowers, wallpaper and pictures.
The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes, fur-trimmed sweaters and leather pants.
But in the excitement, Enron lost touch with its mortality, not to mention morality. Mr. Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks.
He wanted to recruit the best, which meant persuading the leading business school graduates from places such as Harvard, his alma mater, and Stanford to choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley.
He did so by creating the same culture of unselfconscious greed and reward that Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insider-trading scandals of the late 1980s. He built his own Bonfire of the Vanities in Houston and everyone wanted to feel its warmth.
Among the perks were the in-house health club and doctor's office, as well as laundry and car-washing services. Broadband traders were issued hand-held computers and wireless laptops, and frequently went on junkets to the Bahamas or hunting weekends in Mexico. Others accompanied Mr. Skilling to hike glaciers in Patagonia or race Land Cruisers in Australia.
One employee described how he got a 10% discount in a tony men's clothing store by mentioning he worked for Enron. Elsewhere in town, nightclubs waived cover charges for Enron employees.
But the work culture that employed these carrots was brutal.
Managers employed a system known as "rank or yank," with semi-annual reviews in which every employee's performance was ranked one to five. As the names flashed on a projector, the bosses graded them. The bottom 15% of workers were fired each year.
The pay was not particularly high -- trainees started at US$35,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. But they could double that when bonuses were added. Bonus day was known as Car Day, because of the line of expensive sports cars that arrived for the most successful employees -- US$100,000 Porsches were the vehicle of choice.
To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly incestuous, sexually and financially.
Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the whole thing was. They began pulling out as much money as they could.
The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Mr. Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out, while those further down believed the hype.
"We all thrived on the buzz," said Mark Lindquist, 39, a Web designer who lost his US$75,000-a-year job and is struggling to pay for his autistic son's treatment. "It seemed like we were part of something incredible."
He was one of the 4,500 let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec. 2.
Now, not only the rank-and-file are hurting. Yesterday, Mrs. Lay said her family also lost its fortune.
In an interview with NBC's Today show taped over the weekend at her home in Houston, Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent, moral person who, like many thousands of others linked to Enron, was fighting personal bankruptcy.
"Other than the home we live in, everything else is for sale," she said. "We are fighting for liquidity."

Carla,

Any word on changing my parking to Canterra from Ernst and Young?

Chris

Any progress on our access. We would really like to get a look at the weather up here. 

Chris

I am waiting on a list of people who have signed with UBS - I requested one yesterday afternoon from HR.  I will send an e-mail when we get the security set up.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

Chris,

Can you make sure that the guys in Calgary have access to the new fundy's site. I am having problems getting in.

Thanx

A woman has been married to her husband for 30 years. Their sex life has
become really dull.  So one day she decides to spice things up by purchasing
a pair of crotchless panties.  One night while her husband was watching TV,
she put on her crotchless panties and hiked her leg up on the TV.

"Do you want some of this?" she asked her husband.

But he replied, "Hell no, look what it did to your panties!"

I provided that level of detail for calgary trading and marketing. I haven't seen the file Richard Mckeel created so I wouldn't know what is in it. Seems like we have about 3 different people working on the same project. So my answer is I don't know.

Chris

Chris:

I've looked over the spreadsheet that Richard McKeel compiled, and noticed that there was not a detailed listing of every file in the set.  Please advise if we still need to get to this level of detail.

Thanks,
MMarryott  416.865.3720

This is an example of what one analyst sent me for his personal directory

 << File: New Co, Brodeur.xls >> 

Tamara,

Any updates on my IRS refund? Also I need a contact for my 2001 returns. As I will now be working for UBS I will probably be paying privately to have my return done but I would still like PWC to do both my US and Canadian returns for 2001. Please advise.

Hi Chris!

I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in November
regarding your missing cheque.  I wish I had better news for the holiday
season.

Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three times the
trace has been rejected.  The IRS doesn't know why.  They are placing a
formal inquiry into the matter.  The representative I spoke with has
admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are supposed
to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.  I can only
tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.

In the meantime, have a very Merry Holiday Season and a Wonderful New Year!

Best regards,

Could you send the location of the file with the descriptions to Anne Koehler in Houston and cc Nella.

Thanx for your help.

Chris

Everything has been copied to the newco directory.  We have one master index with the file names and descriptions.  Let me know if you have questions.
Peggy

Everything from Ops, Trading, Marketing, and Development in Calgary, plus Mike's inputs from Toronto, has been consolidated into one master index.  The file is located at 

	I:\NewCo\00_README.xls

If you have additional items to add to your directories, or I have not yet received inputs from you, please update the master index.  There is one tab for each department.

Dance partner?

Perfect.  Was your brother disappointed that we had to let his dance partner go earlier this week?

All the trading and marketing stuff is in I/Newco/Trading and I/Newco/Marketing and the master description file in I/Newco has descriptions of their contents.

Chris

Chris - In order that we are able to set up the transfer of files in an orderly fashion and, more importantly,  maintain security protections for certain directories (e.g. legal) I believe a better approach is to replicate our existing directory tree structure under a new I:/Newco/ directory.  At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). 

In this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to  I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created).  I apologize that this is a hassle for those who have already transfered files.

If you have any concerns please let me know.

Regards
Chris

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

Thanx 

Chris

Nella Cappaletto has a master list of all Canadian software and applications.

Chris

The files for the Canadian office are located in I:/Newco/...

The master despriction file contains descriptions of the contents of all of the files from the trading and marketing groups for easier navigation.

If you have any ?'s give me a call.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

We are going back to the Deer tonight and I am going to have some people over tommorow pre-whiskey (around 7:30). You should come by tommorow night. My home number is 214-0454 and my cell is 875-6146. Talk to you later.

Strong decade foreseen for real estate 
'Demand for all types of housing is set to surge': Aging Baby Boomers, their children and immigrants to drive residential prices
Paul Vieira 
Financial Post 
The tail end of the Baby Boom generation, along with children of aging boomers and new immigrants to Canada, will keep the residential real estate market strong over the next 10 years, driving the average value of a house up 13%, a new study suggests.
"Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate," says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research.
And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says.
Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes.
Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants.
"Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms" Mr. Norman said in an interview.
The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units.
And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added.
The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said.
"A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."
Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population.
"Calgary is going through its renaissance period," Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto.
Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units.
Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments, older civil servants retire and new people are brought in, and the high-tech sector rebounds.

Was she the one coming back from lunch as I was leaving?

You actually passed her when you walked out. You have to remind me about that stuff, otherwise I'll forget. She's wearing a pinkish shirt today, but she might have had a jacket on when you passed her. She saw you at the very last second so you maybe didn't see her. As you can tell...I don't matchmake very pro-actively.
You'll have to come back again.

Dec. 12, 01:00 EDT Toronto real estate seen as solid value 
15% to 20% increase in equity expected over next 10 years
Tony Wong
business reporter
	
Worried about what your home will be worth 10 years from now if you buy it today? 
After deducting inflation, the average Toronto home should be worth anywhere from 15 per cent to 20 per cent more over the next decade, says a study released yesterday. 
Resale values for a Toronto home should do better than the national average, with a solid - although unspectacular - gain in equity, once inflation is factored in. That conclusion comes from research by real estate analysts Clayton Research Associates Ltd. in conjunction with ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada and ReMax of Western Canada. "Toronto will remain the rock of Gibraltar, showing decent, steady gains over the next decade," says Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada. 
Given that capital gains on a principal home are not taxable, that means an average gain in equity to the Toronto homeowner of 1.5 to 2 per cent every year over the next decade. That might be nothing to do cartwheels over, but it's a relatively comfortable return considering the meltdown in the equity markets. Across Canada, the average home is expected to increase by about 13 per cent in 10 years. 
"I've always said real estate is investment for dummies. You pay your mortgage, have someplace to live and you own a home in 25 years. It's not spectacular stuff, but you do come out ahead," says Alexander. 
That was not the case in the previous decade, however. From 1991 to 2001, home prices increased by only 9 per cent, from an average of $234,313 in 1991, to a forecasted $255,000 by the end of this year. If you factor in inflation, you'd be getting a negative return on your investment. 
However, Clayton Research says the next decade will be different than the last, primarily because: 
Demand for home ownership will remain elevated due to the low vacancy rates in Toronto rental accommodation. 
About half of Canada's international migration is destined for Toronto, which will boost population growth and first-time buyer demand. 
While the present economic slowdown is taking a toll on the Toronto economy, the medium-term outlook for Toronto is favourable. 
Canada-wide, the number of households is expected to expand by another 1.5 million over the next 10 years. 
While homes in Toronto, Ottawa and Kitchener-Waterloo are expected to post gains of 15 per cent to 20 per cent over the next decade, Calgary is forecast to lead the country in terms of appreciating housing values of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent. 
Clayton Research says the most significant event driving the housing market will continue to be demographic. The post-war generation born between 1946 and 1966 is moving into prime homeownership years. 
The youngest members of the group are 35 years old and will be 45 in 2011. According to census figures, people older than 45 are about 15 per cent more likely to own a home than people between 35 and 45. They are also set to inherit considerable wealth from their parents, a factor expected to affect their housing choices. 
On the other end of the market, the 20 to 35 age group is also expected to see a significant upswing, which means more people buying starter homes. Despite the lust we see for condominiums today, the study says that single detached homes will be the most popular dwelling of choice. 
"The traditional single detached home will be in strongest demand over the coming decade" representing 60 per cent of net new households. Condominiums and apartments will still see healthy demand.

Dec. 11, 01:00 EDT Banks said preparing Enron bids 
Other big lenders may make offers later, reports say
	
NEW YORK (AP) - Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG are reportedly preparing rival bids to purchase the sputtering trading operations of Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy giant that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month. 
The two investment banks are expected to make separate proposals as early as this week to a New York bankruptcy court, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times reported yesterday, citing unidentified sources. 
Enron's trading business, which accounted for roughly 90 per cent of earnings in the third quarter, has deteriorated in recent weeks because of uncertainty about Enron's finances. 
JP Morgan Chase and Co., which like Citigroup is a large Enron creditor, is expected to submit its own offer at a later stage, the newspapers said. The potential size of the bids was not reported. 
Shares of Enron climbed 4 cents (U.S.) to close at 79 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Negotiators for Enron, Citigroup and UBS met over the weekend to finalize the details of the proposals, although sources warned that either one may still be withdrawn, the newspapers said. 
According to the reports, Enron would retain a large minority stake under the terms of the proposals being prepared. 
Representatives from Citigroup and UBS said their companies would not comment on the matter. Enron did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 
Just months ago, Enron was the country's seventh-largest company in terms of revenue. 
But the company stock plummeted after the company in October revealed questionable partnerships that helped keep billions of dollars of debt off its books and Enron acknowledged it overstated profits for four years. 
The swift collapse has launched investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, labor department, justice department and a congressional committee. 
Yesterday, Enron said it will negotiate a retention plan for some of its remaining employees after paying $105 million during the past two months to keep almost 600 workers on the job. 
The former top energy trader paid $50 million in bonuses last month to keep 75 workers, mostly electricity and natural-gas traders, while trying to conclude a merger with rival Dynegy Inc. That's before paying $55 million in bonuses to about 500 employees just ahead of its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing. 
Enron wants to retain employees needed to keep the trading business operating in hopes it can survive and emerge from Chapter 11 protection, analysts said. 
"It seems logical that they would have to spend to keep key people," said Mike Heim, an A.G. Edwards analyst in St. Louis, Mo. 
Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer, however, said more job cuts are likely at the Houston-based company. 
He declined to comment on how much more Enron might spend on employee retentions. "It depends on what we can work out with the creditors' committee," Palmer said. 
"It's all up to the judge in the end, but usually the judge weighs heavily what the creditors' committee says." 
Enron cut 60 per cent of the 7,500 workers at its Houston headquarters last week, and 1,100 jobs were eliminated in the U.K. Before the company filed for bankruptcy last week, it employed 21,000 people.

Hi Chris,

Just a note to let you know that a tax equalization calculation will not be
prepared for you,,,, in case you were unsure.  This means that the refund

Ryan,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you. As you can Imagine things around here have been a little nuts. Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi. Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me. The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end. As far a snowboarding I'm not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas. I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend. Hope all is good with you and I'll talk to you soon. Are you going to be in Red Deer this weekend? If so let me know and I will give you a call.

Chris

Chris,

What's your schedule like over the next few weekends...I'd like to go
snowboarding sometime soon, as the hills are open (not all runs though).

Later,
Ryan

Congress to Probe Enron Downfall

AP Online via COMTEX
November 30, 2001

Enron Corp. [ENE], already jarred by a spiraling stock price, a collapsed merger and massive debt, will be under the scrutiny of Congress.
Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on Thursday announced hearings into Enron's accounting practices and into what impact the company's problems might have on electricity and natural gas markets.

"We're very interested in how the company handled its internal books," said Kenneth Johnson, a spokesman for the congressman, adding that the committee's general counsel had been directed to investigate circumstances leading up to the collapse.
Bankruptcy may be the smartest option for Enron Corp. as the once-mighty energy trader tries to extricate itself from a tangled mess of junk credit and massive debt, a bankruptcy expert and professor said.
"I would assume it would lead to a sale of the company, which was coming anyway," said Jay Westbrook, a bankruptcy expert who teaches at the University of Texas School of Law.
"Bankruptcy provides a lot of protections that makes it easier to do, and it buys time to find out what this company's really worth. That was Dynegy's problem - trying to figure out what the company was worth."
Analysts predicted bankruptcy was Enron's only option as the humbled company limped into limited operation Thursday to let skittish traders cut ties with it. The top executive for Dynegy Inc. [DYN], Enron's smaller rival and would-be savior, also detailed how Enron's financial "decay" caused a rescue merger to crumble.
Stunned employees tried to find hope in the fact that Enron - just months ago a towering presence in the energy markets - had yet to make a bankruptcy filing.
EnronOnline, the company's Internet-based trading system, was up and running on a limited basis for traders to finish transactions and offset credit risk with the company. The site, which was the first of its kind, was shut down for several hours Wednesday after Dynegy Inc. called off the merger.
But analysts said that operation, which was Enron's chief money maker, needs cash and credit to survive - both of which are scarce for the trader.
``Everyone should have at least some skepticism that it could ever emerge from Chapter 11,'' A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim said Thursday. ``The energy trading business has probably taken such a hit to its reputation that it would be difficult to retrench and go forward.''
Enron officials did not return repeated calls for comment.
A haggard Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy Inc., said a steady stream of revelations of weak finances and decline in Enron's core energy trading business left his company no choice but to walk away.
"This was a very difficult, complex, unprecedented decay of a company over many months," he said at a news conference. "That's a shame, because (a merger) could have worked."
Dynegy announced the rescue plan Nov. 9, knowing that Enron posted a $618 million loss in third-quarter earnings and had ousted its chief financial officer for running partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.
But that wasn't all.
Nov. 19 Enron filed paperwork with the SEC that restated its earnings back to 1997, eliminating more than $580 million in reported income in that time span. The filing also disclosed that Enron would have to pay a $690 million debt within a week.
Enron got an extension for the debt, but its stock resumed a free-fall that had halted temporarily with the merger announcement. Dynegy started renegotiating Enron's sale price.
After falling 85% Wednesday, shares of Enron were off another 25 cents, or 41 percent, to finish at 36 cents in extremely heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron's 52-week high was reached last December, at $84.88.
Watson said surprises in the SEC filing caused irreparable damage, even as Dynegy continued to hammer away at an agreement.
When two agencies cut Enron's credit rating to junk status Wednesday - triggering an obligation to pay debts of $3.9 billion, or nearly twice the cash the company is believed to have - Watson said he had to stop trying to save another company and protect his own.
Watson said Dynegy invoked an escape clause in the merger agreement that allowed it to back out if Enron had serious financial problems, so Dynegy won't have to pay a $350 million breakup fee.
He also said Dynegy will acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline - which has 16,500 miles of pipelines from Texas to the Great Lakes - in exchange for the $1.5 billion part-Dynegy owner ChevronTexaco pumped into the ailing trader. "Their pipeline operation is as good as any in the industry," Watson said. "The real question is the wholesale operation, and the viability of that and how fast they can come back into the market."
Enron may challenge that acquisition, but Watson said the tradeoff ensured ChevronTexaco wouldn't be out $1.5 billion.
"That pipeline will be Dynegy's Dec. 19," he said.
Rob Doty, Dynegy's chief financial officer, said Friday that because Dynegy is the pipeline's preferred stockholder, Northern Natural Gas cannot seek bankruptcy protection without Dynegy's approval.
He said the pipeline has been a separate subsidiary of Enron for more than 20 years. Dynegy will assume $950 million of Northern Natural Gas debt, Doty said. 

What do you think I don't have the internet here? How you doing? Milly's meeting was pretty upbeat. I feel really good about everything today. I think there are about 4 different scenarios that could play out and all are OK. Call me if you want to chat.

December 3, 2001
Enron files for Chapter 11 owing US$13B 
Canadian unit may survive: Filing allows energy giant to operate while restructuring
Peter Fitzpatrick 
Financial Post, with files from wire services 
Enron Corp. is seeking bankruptcy protection in one of the largest Chapter 11 filings in history, but its Canadian subsidiary is hoping to survive the energy giant's implosion.
Houston-based Enron took the widely-expected step yesterday in New York City. It was the latest humiliation for the leading U.S. energy trader, which boasted US$100-billion in revenue and US$1-billion in profit last year, but whose shares lost US$26-billion in market value in less than two months because of accounting concerns.
"While uncertainty during the past few weeks has severely impacted the market's confidence in Enron and its trading operations, we are taking the steps announced today to help preserve capital, stabilize our businesses, restore the confidence of our trading counterparties, and enhance our ability to pay our creditors," Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Enron listed about US$24.7-billion in assets and US$13.1-billion in debts in court papers. The largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in history was Texaco Inc.'s US$35.9-billion filing in 1987.
The filing will allow Enron to continue operating while it negotiates a recovery plan with creditors, including the likely layoff of thousands of its 7,400 employees. It also blocks debt-collection efforts, lawsuits and other actions against the company.
Enron, which is looking to obtain debtor-in- possession financing to let it carry on, also said it is suing Dynegy Inc. for US$10-billion.
Dynegy triggered the collapse when it backed out of a US$23-billion takeover bid for Enron last week. Dynegy balked after learning Enron had overstated earnings by US$580-million since 1997 and had debt in outside partnerships that reduced shareholder equity by US$1.2-billion.
Enron's European arm went into bankruptcy last Thursday but it appears yesterday's filing did not cover its Canadian operation, Enron Canada Corp.
Calls yesterday to the Calgary-based subsidiary were not returned but in an affidavit filed in an Alberta court Friday, Robson Milnthorp, president and chief executive of the Canadian subsidiary, said he had been told by the parent company's lawyers that Enron Canada and its affiliates would be not be covered by any U.S. filing.
Enron Canada employs 143. It markets and trades electrical power and natural gas and has about $2.1-billion worth of contracts with hundreds of Canadian companies.
Mr. Milnthorp said in the affidavit that Enron Canada is a viable company on its own, but it needs time for advisors it has hired to negotiate with investors and potential buyers to recapitalize the firm.
Enron Canada asked for a stay under the Canada Business Corporations Act to prevent its partners in Canada from cancelling contracts, which they are able to do because the parent company can no longer guarantee them.
"Under the current climate of market hysteria, it is important to quiet things down and permit Enron Canada to demonstrate its financial strength and ability to perform independently of Enron Corp.," Mr. Milnthorp pleaded.
Although Justice D.G. Hart denied the stay, he told Enron to come back Wednesday once it had notified its Canadian partners of the application. Yesterday, however, a source familiar with the case said such a bid would be stillborn.
"If they try to do this application on Wednesday, there will be a ton of opposition. It will be almost impossible for them to get this order through," said the source, speaking before the Chapter 11 was announced.
The source said Enron Canada's only alternative may be to seek protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, although that may be of no help since such a filing could also trigger contract cancellations.
Enron Corp.'s collapse leaves a global creditor list. Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. financial services company, is owed US$3-billion from two loans and J.P. Morgan Chase's Chase Manhattan Bank is owed more than US$1.9-billion. In Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has a US$215-million exposure. Other Canadian banks downplayed or did not comment upon the situation last week.
Standard & Poor's said banks and other financial institutions face losses of US$6.3-billion through credit derivatives.

 

This definately sucks ass. It is surreal. I feel like I am watching a movie and this is happening to someone else. Other than work, how are things? I am so glad to be back in Canada. Except that it is really really cold. Are you on the internal MSN IM? Take care.

Chris

does this "suck my ass" or what?

As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.  Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.  As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.  

In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.  At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.  Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.  Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs. 

We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.  This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.

I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.  Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.  All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.

Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.  We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.  As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.  Thank you.

Thanx for the update. I'm going to owe them $ in April and they aren't getting that untill I get mine.

Hi Chris,

As promised, I have phoned the IRS today and spoken with a representative
who was able to tell me that the original request for the trace on your
cheque on September 19 was rejected by their system on October 22.  He told
me that he couldn't tell me why because the IRS aren't sure either why the
system rejected it.  As such, a new request for a trace was placed on
October 22 and now the IRS are asking us to wait until December 17.  The
IRS told me that you should receive a letter called a 510C letter from
them.  I have changed your address with the IRS from Texas to Calgary.  I
would ask that when you receive this letter to fax a copy to my attention
at 781-1825 for our files.

I know that this probably isn't the news you were hoping to hear, but at
least it's some news.  I have made a note to follow up with the IRS again
on December 17 and hopefully by then they will have good news in time for
the holidays!

Again, don't hesitate to contact either Judy or myself should you hear
anything further from the IRS, receive your cheque(!) or have any other
questions or concerns.

Kind regards,

That's cool. I think AEC is going to do it financially with us and take care of buying the phys in the market. Did you get 80 million?

Chris

Last week it would have been two cents, but now that there is a huge credit spread in the market, it may cost them .07.  We simply can't buy the physical volumes right now.  The credit spread in the SJ to cover our short is costing us .20.  

I love this market.

Mike,

Looks like we all can't go to the WEI party, see comments below

Liz,

As this reception is targetted towards the more executive level within each
company and because we have a venue that has a maximum capacity (and have
been receiving mostly positive RSVP's), we have carefully chosen the

Sounds good. If you talk to Heather Flemming or any one else mention Saturday night. I have to pick up some jeans at Underground so I will stop by and visit you tommorow. 

Chris
Hi Chris, yeah I'll be around this weekend and likely up for a drink or two. As long as you don't keep spreading my weekend parties around my office! Just kidding. I actually got an email from Steph at the same time as you telling me about Dan so I don't know who else I would talk to that would care, but I can give it a shot.
Oh yeah...as for the girl I was thinking I should set you up with, she was away last week when you came in but if you're ever wandering around, she sits in the second office in that's behind you when you are standing at the reception desk, her name is Tina and she's one of our financial advisors, really cute & really nice. So you can come check her out and of course stop by and say hi to me.
I'll see you Saturday, if not sooner.

What's up? Good to hear from you. I am very happily back in Calgary. Things at Enron are totally fucked up right now. Not really sure how it is going to play out. Anyway life goes on. Tell D'arcy I made less than 10 million last year. Take it easy and I'll right more later.

Chris

Hey Chris,

How are you doing?  How are things at Enron.  I was shocked to see the stock
price today.

Are you back in Calgary or still in Houston?

Let me know, are you coming to visit.  Do I have stories for you!!!

Speak to you soon,

Hope Dina and the baby are doing well.

Hi,

I'm wondering if I can trade physical Stanfield gas on EOL. We are looking to back gas off from the 70,000 firm we ship. I'd like to be able to purchase Stanfield gas and back it off back to Aeco. Our Houston guys would prefer this to us calling back and forth all day and deciding on volumes and prices. Is this possible and how do we need to get it set up??

Thanks,
Ryan

Judy

That is what I thought. Have you heard anything regarding my refund? Did they trace the check? Let me know.

Thanx

Chris Dorland

Hi Chris,

Just a note to let you know that a tax equalization calculation will not be
prepared for you,,,, in case you were unsure.  This means that the refund
owing to you on the US return is 100% yours - which is good news, right?

Last trade 0.70. Success has worked for me so far.

He screwed me... sold at $0.40 but I learned my lesson (couldn't get out of order)...

but don't be so brash man... "Success is a lousy teacher. It makes smart people think that they can't lose." - Bill Gates

Sorry to freak on you. I'm a little stressed. Do what you think is right but never use market orders on option. It is a free option for the market maker to fuck you.

Chris

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

Enron getting worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sherry, 

This stuff looks perfect. I think I like the 385-B the best. I don't think I want the hutch though. So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533). Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock. Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff. Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House. Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company. 

Thanx for all the help!

Chris

Hi Chris, 
     Following is information  re:  the home office we spoke of earlier.  We have stock of the  385/522 double hutch, the 385/512 single pedestal desk, 385/513 double pedestal  desk, 385/514 computer desk, 385/530 cabinet, 385/551 30" bookcase, 385/552 48"  bookcase, and finally the 385/553 76" bookcase.  If we special order  any pieces they will take about 6 weeks to arrive.  Further to this, we  will deliver the La-z-boy suite, occassional tables, carpet, bed, etc. on  Thursday Oct 25. We are still waiting for your dining room suite to  arrive.  With any luck it will be here and we will deliver it as well. Any  concerns or questions regarding the above, please call.  Hoping  this info helps!!!!!

PLEASE ADVISE ASAP

I'll give you a call later to discuss...

I have talked to Sierra Pacific and they have some storage... I will advise.

I think fuller was doing some leg work also.

Do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows?

Also, are you able to replicate the delivery point off of JP to make this happen? 

BT 

Tych,

Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

Chris

Maria,

That is pretty close but we don't even have real guns... just snowballs....

How are things going down there? I am pretty much settled now but still waiting for a bunch of furniture so my house is pretty empty. Hope all is well.

Chris

sorry...but this was too funny to pass up.
the pics are at the bottom.

Might forward to Canuck!!

Grigs,

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

Chris

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Grigsby

The bonus structure was lined out in detail in a couple of HR video conferences we had with Houston. It is about 10X better than enrons.

Hey,

Does their description of the bonus structure concern you at all...may be payable, in part, in an equity award pursuant to the Firm's programs or plans. There is no choice like at Enron.

Let me know what you think,

Hi Chris, 
 
I have just completed an MBA at IVEY and am looking to you for help and  advice.
 
I am interested to work at Enron in the  Corporate Finance Area.
 
This is specifically in the Capital Raising Function (Mergers &  Acquisitions, IPOs etc).
 
As per my understanding this could also be part of a Treasury area.
 
I am unsure of this. I am unable to ascertain this  information from the website.
 
My guess is that this might be based in the US at the Head  Office.
 
At this point I am looking for some direction (someone who you could refer  me to in the US) 
 
who could provide me this information or deal with this matter directly  (non-HR).
 
Could you give me some feedback in this regard.
 
By way of background, I have just completed an  MBA at the Richard Ivey School of business in London Ontario -  Canada.
 
Apart from this I bring to the table a good  amount of experience in the field of finance.
 
As a Chartered Accountant, I have over 7 years  international experience in the field of finance as an  Analyst - Financial Valuation, 
 
an Analyst - Equity Research  and as an Equities Dealer and  finally in the Risk  Management area.  
 
Last summer I worked at the Royal Bank Dominion  Securities Toronto as an Equities Research Associate - Gold Mining.  
 
I hope to hear from you in the near future.
 
Cheers

Hi Caroline,

Any chance of getting a price quote on the Sumas/Malin swap?

Thank you very little...

Chris... this is the verbatum text from my CFA study material. You might want to cc this to dad as well:
 
1. Analysis of overall performance. How good are professional money managers?
 
- A study by Sharpe found that the average mutual fund manager did as well as the DJIA, but, after expenses, net returns were below those of the DJIA.
- Jensen found that after adjusting for risk the average fund earned about 1.1 percent less than they should have. Mains revised Jensen's study and conclued that fund performance was neutral.
- Carlson and Lehmann/Modest found that performance measurement varied with the index used, but overall, average performance was consistently inferior to the market.
- Cunby/Glen showed that internatinally diversified funds have not beaten the international index after adjustments for risk.
- Blake/Elton/Gruber show that bond mutual funds have not outpermed relevant bond indexes.
 
3. Market timing abilities: Performance can be attributed to security selection or to market timing ability. Can fund mangers time the market, that is, switch to an aggressive posture in advance of market upswings and switch to a conservative posture in advance of market downswings? Academic researchers conclude that there is no evidence to show that managers can time the market. 
 
4. Consistency of performance: Klemkosky concluded that investors should not use past performance to predict short-run future performance. Dunn/Theisen concluded that historical performance should be given little weight when picking a manager.
 
5. What should you derive from this or expect from a fund?
 
- The fund manager should help you determine your risk return preferences and then help you pick a fund that matches them.
- The fund should give you instant diversification.
- The fund should maintain its diversification and keep its risk class constant.
- The fund should try to achieve superior risk adjusted performance.
- The fund should provide you timely information for tax purposes and reinvest your dividends.

Send me stats...

1.  Open Microsoft Word.
2.  Type "Q33 NY"-(this is one of the planes that crashed into the WTC).
3.  Select the text and change to font size 36.
4.  Now change the font to "wingdings" and then you will see.

Looks like bullshit to me. How was the Deer this weekend? What are you doing this weekend? I will probably just be moving all weekend but we should go out next weekend.

Chris

Apparently this was from a camera found in the wreckage of the WTC, 
developed by 
the  FBI for eveidence and released on the net today....the guy 
still has no name and is missing ....

Stalker,

I just talked to Milly and he suggested I get with you to talk about our position on Duke's aquisition of Westcoast. I just want to understand which regulatory body oversees the pipeline and what (if any) rules will apply to creating a wall between the pipe and Duke's marketing organization. Let me know when you have got a minute.

Chris

Keith,

How was Portland? I'm out of the office moving most of Monday but I'll give you a call on Tuesday. Did you get a chance to drop of my keys at the rental office?

Chris

Megan,

I haven't bought a car yet but I will let you know when I get one. When do we get the stalls in E&Y?

Chris

Good Afternoon:

I am in the process of setting up your new parking stalls for the Ernst & Young Tower.  Please e-mail me a list of all cars you may drive to work.  I will need your licence number and a description of the car.

Hey, if you want to head out later call me at home 243-1890.

If one year ago you bought $1000 worth of Nortel today it would be worth
$50. If one year ago today you bought $1000 worth of budweiser, drank
all of it and returned the cans you would have $80.

I called the number you gave me and they said that my refund check had been mailed in May. I never received the check and am wondering what to do next? The IRS said they would put a trace on the check and get back to me but that was over a week ago. I was wondering if PWC could look into it for me as you might get further than I have. Please contact me if you need any further info. or with any questions. 

Thank you,

John,

Cancelled my trip to Vancouver this weekend. Car I was going to look at sold already. How are things going? Married? I am soo glad to be back in Calgary. I didn't think much of Houston. Life has been pretty boring. Looks like things are going to get busy again. Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy. A new sub of UBS AG. Should be good. Seems like at great company. AA+ credit will be nice. They have a good risk tolerance and are more or less going to give us limits and let us do our own thing. Hopefully a little more stable than Enron. I think the largest financial instituion in the world should be. Anyway give me a call if you get to Calgary and we will grab some food.

Take care

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Brad,

Any progress on the direct line with the west desk? If we need to use a different circuit or something let me know. I called Mike Grigsby and asked him to look into it on his end. It is important that we get this line working as soon as possible.

I need that receipt and photocopy asap please.

I know you were.

Hi Traci,

I had a very relaxing weekend. Slept 10 hours both nights. Worked out and chilled. Very good weekend except for the weather. No worries about Friday. The highways were ridiculous. My brother is coming to town on Thursday for a week. It will be good to see him. I am planning on being in Red Deer on the weekend of the 8th. Maybe we can get together then. Let me know if you are free.Have a great week and I will speak to you soon!

Chris

Hello Chris.

I ended up driving to Salt Lake City and flying to Portland (I left Houston on Wednesday night and got in to Portland late Thursday night).  I hope you were successful in getting back to Calgary.  Regards, Wayne.

Wayne,

I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland. I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back. Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it.

I thought you would like it...

It is the end-all be-all of Grand Cherokees.

Retail is $52,300 - your cash price is $45,488 including rebates.

As for Sept 6/7, what I will do is bring down the matching twin of the Jeep
in the Silverstone colour for you to play with.  It is a demo and identical
to the black one other than the exterior colour, so you will be able to see
what you think of it.

If he is in Houston don't count on him doing it. I won't be getting out of here untill tommorow at the earliest and I am thinking it is going to be Friday or Saturday.
 
Chris

Chris,
 
    I will get risk to do that once your book has been completely emptied and all of the deals you have done plus the Station 2- Aeco Spread position has been moved into the book, there is an excel model we can run that dumps all of the deals in the book into a spreadsheet, until then however I will list all of the deals you have done and will send them to you.  Gillis has been in Houston, I am expecting him back today (possibly tomorrow).  
 
Hopes this works.  Let me know if you need anything else.
 
Carlos

Carlos,
 
Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books (Financial and Gas Daily) as of close of business on Friday (Sept.14). I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it.

I just wanted to thank all of you for getting in touch over the past day

Thanks again,

I would like an indoor stall in Ernst and Young. Non-reserved.

Thanx,

Chris

Good Afternoon Everyone:

We have recently come upon an indoor parking opportunity in the Ernst & Young Tower as approximately 30 indoor stalls have become available.

Right now you are either parking in the Westin Hotel lot (paying $342.40/month) or in the Eau Claire Market lot (paying $300.00/month).  If you choose to take a stall in the Ernst & Young Tower, you will pay $353.10/month for an  unreserved stall or $401.25/month for a reserved stall.

Before making a decision as to whether you would like to switch over to one of these indoor stalls, please take a moment to consider the pros and cons:

Pro:							Con:

Indoor Parking						Outdoor Parking
							Price per month is Higher
							Month-to-Month Basis (Either Side Can Cancel with One-Month's Notice)*	
							Your Taxable Benfit Goes Up 	

Please let me know prior to Wednesday, September 19, 2001 whether you would like one of these stalls.

Thank you,

Megan

*Ernst & Young may cancel at any time at their discretion.

Ian,
 
When I said spread I didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price (these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did) I want a graph of the relationship (spread) between the 2 points. i.e. if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at (0.45) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65. Sorry if I wasn't clear. Call me with any ?s.

Ian,
 
Thanx looks good. What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips.

Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,

A couple of other quick things. My October Sumas position doesn't look correct. I am short 45000 mm/d and the report shows 50000 mm/d. I will list my oct sumas trades below if you can check on it for me. Also can you make sure my gas daily book is set up and include the change in position report in your daily e-mail.

Kim,
 
I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule. I am in the Houston office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends. If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday. Let me know when you would like to get together. I am sitting at 3208b.

Judi,

Did you receive a quote for Williams yet? When I spoke with Terri she said that $5000 USD was a pretty good estimate for my move.

Chris

I haven't been given instructions from anyone at Enron in regards to the reimbursement of the car loss and how they want it to be handled,   I will enquire with Dawn and one of us will let you know once it's decided,

Judi

Looks OK except that it doesn't include the reimbursement for my car.

So much for keeping it quiet. Dorland the loudmouth is back in town.

We want to keep it somewhat quiet since not everyone is invited.  We are planning to get to Banff for dinner at 7:30.  I'll talk to you about it later.

Anna,

I am moving back to Canada to trade gas but I would really like to get your daily technical sheet. Could you e-mail it to me or perhaps start posting it on the commodity fundy's site? Thanx

Chris

Kim,

Got the envelope yesterday. Thank you very much.

Chris

Ben, here is where Chris is sitting.  Please drop off the envelope.  If uncertain on where the West Desk is on 32 ask Ina.

Kim,

I am sitting on the West desk on 32.

Chris

I had asked that it be delivered to you by hand before I left Thursday.  Apparently, they tried a few times but I asked Ben to only hand it to you.  We will bring it down today.

Kim,

Any luck getting this info. for me?

Chris

Mikey,

Dan is going to come to town this weekend. I was thinking of going to the deer on friday and then going out in Calgary saturday night.

Let me know what you think.

Chris

Russell,

Can you e-mail me the "model" spread sheet. I want the eol technology.

I just want to print this off.

 

This didn't work for some reason. Can you try to send it again and just copy and paste all the values.

When I was 26 I was looking for an 18 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like Britney Spears. Keep your eyes open. 2 Weeks till I am back in Calgary. I can't wait. Sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here. I'm going to buy an Grand Cherokee Limited like my mom's. Black I think. What's new? I can't wait to get this move over and get settled in Calgary. I am really excited to move into my new place. It is going to be sweet. I think I can accomodate your request for a synthetic pillow. Are we going to be able to get some golf in before the snow comes? Talk to you soon.

My one year closed interest rate on my mortgage is 5.2%. Not bad!

I sold my car. $28000 USD but Enron is going to pay me $3000 USD for not having to move it and get it licensed in Canada. So it cost me $5000 to drive that car for a year. Not bad I guess. Have you and mom had any problems with her jeep? 

Chris

Mike,

I am not coming to Vancouver this weekend after all. The car I really wanted to look at sold so I am postponing my trip. I will probably be coming out in the next month or so and I will let you know. Take it easy. Do you have John Hughes' e-mail address?

Dorland

Glad you like the place. Missed the PS on the first message.

Thurday night, Johnny wants to reunite.  I may get lynched from Maris and Steph if I don't go to v-ball as it is playoffs - I'll let you know - may be late night Johnny (9 oclock).  What are you doing for the rest of the weekend.  Should I talk to Ry-Ry, some ladies, etc and set up a night where we hit the town?  Or do you have plans.  Keep me posted.

PS 
I drove by your place - babe layer...nice. 

I am going to Banff for an off site. I will be back in town the following Friday and we'll do it up that night. Late night Johnny is OK. We'll take it easy as it is a school night.

1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
ESCAPEE 
Definition: 
  A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  
COURTESY FLUSH 
Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing the 
WALK OF SHAME. 
WALK OF SHAME 
Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment  
if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
COURTESY FLUSH. 
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with   
newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office for 
the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
SAFE HAVEN 
Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering 
the bathroom. 
TURD BURGLAR 
Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
CAMO-COUGH 
Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used 
 in 
conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
ASTAIRE 
Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that 
the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
WATERMELON 
Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON  
coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
HAVANA OMELET 
Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
UNCLE TED 
Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the  
pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
 you 
should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
FLY BY 
Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
CRACK WHORE 
Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
 WHORE 
can become a SAFE HAVEN.  

That is great. We were just having a discussion about going to other floors to take a shit because our bathroom is such a dump.

What if any changes were made to the Grand Cherokee Limited for 2002?

Good morning Chris...

Actually, I was just out of the office most of yesterday and hadn't had a
chance to do your lease numbers, but I guess the lease isn't an issue
anymore...

By the way, if you are having grief selling your car, let me know - I can
post it on MegaWheels for you for free.  It's amazing how fast cars sell on
their website.

Anyway, if you need anything at all, let me know as I will be on the
computer all day today so I will be available right away.

No luck getting your lease calculator to work? Actually, don't worry about it I have change my mind back to buying.

I thought you would like it...

It is the end-all be-all of Grand Cherokees.

Retail is $52,300 - your cash price is $45,488 including rebates.

As for Sept 6/7, what I will do is bring down the matching twin of the Jeep
in the Silverstone colour for you to play with.  It is a demo and identical
to the black one other than the exterior colour, so you will be able to see
what you think of it.

How does that sound?

Tricia,

I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.

Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND
Duty on this amount = 3300
GST on this amount = 3800
Excise tax = 180
Permits = 400

Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500

That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.

Hardly seems like the best option.

Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:

Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)
Flight = $1500 CND
Hotel = $1500 CND
October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October)

The total of the above is $11 800.

Hi Chris.  I have some information for you about how to bring your car into Canada.  You'll have to do a little leg work, but you will get the  answers you're looking for.

First thing... call the Registrar of Imported Vehicles (RIV) here in Canada (1-888-848-8240 toll free U.S. & Canada).    You'll need the make, model, year, and original purchase price of your car.   This agency will tell you if your car is eligible for import and what if any modifications are required.    Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Generally you do not have to pay duty on the car if it originates from the U.S.    You'll have to pay 7% GST on the purchase value (less depreciation if you've had the car more than 30 days) converted into CAD$ using the f/x rate on the date of import.  There are some excise taxes for having an air conditioner ($100) or for a vehicle weighing more than 4,425 pounds.  Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Once you have an estimate of the costs for bringing your car here please let us know in case your relocation budget needs to be reviewed.

 << File: Importing a Vehicle.pdf >>   This document explains the process in more detail and has an example of the cost calculation.

Talk to you later,

I'm not very excited to hang out with Mikey all the time. See what Johnny is up to and hit the Benson and Hedges menthol's.

 
I don't know dude.  Leslie just told me she wanted your number as she is going to TO.  Hopefully it's soon.  I would really like to here a story about how the two of you went out for a glass of wine in TO.  Then she had 1 too many, spilt on her top, then asked to go back to your place to wash it out.  She then put one of your old T shirts on while it was in the wash.  You guys proceeded to have a couple more drinks.  When the shirt was finished drying - you were both pretty drunk.  She went to give you the old shirt back  - and didn't put the new one on.  You started to neck.  One thing led to another and you ended up smokin' a Benson and Hedges at 2:30 eastern time with a lovely red head lying on your 'coyote' arm - you are lying there thinkin', "I can't wait to call Marsy and George and tell them I nailed that hot chick from the wedding - and I was fantastic!"
 
 
Sorry dude, she is hot and my mind started racing,
 
Do us proud,
 
Georgetown.

No, when's she coming to town?

ouch! 

Kim called?

John,

Here is what I think my out of pocket costs of this move will be:

Movers - $7500 CND
Flight - $1500 CND
Temp. Accomodations - $1500 CND
October Rent - $1500 CND

I am already at $12000 CND and I haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet.

Chris
I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.

John,

Did you have a chance to talk to Dawn / Milly? Even if you want to work the flight / hotel / movers the usual way and then pay the balance as a "signing bonus" or something that would probably work. I am going to take a bath on my car in a big way. The option of moving my it back to Canada is out of the question as I just found out I would have to pay 6.1% import duty, 7% GST and about $400 in excise taxes and permits. Let me know.

Chris

What doesn't he like about it?

I think he's on the offer, looking at a few things. I'll not forget you
angus....

What does the Kergan think of his Jeep? I think I am going to get one of
those. Unless you have forgotten the Kergan's where an acient people from
the steps of Russia who , for entertainment, tossed children in pits with
wild dogs to fight for food.

         Listen to this shit. If I want to move my car back to Canada I
      (Enron)
         would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value in
      import
         duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in permits.
      Looks
         like I am looking for a new car as well.

Lady with python on one side , Star wars on the other...

I would go with the star wars painting on the side myself...

Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red interior
lights. Chicks are going to love it. I'm going to get a chick with a python
wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick out 6
inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims. SWEET! The funny thing
is that in some neighborhoods in Houston (predominately latin) that would
be a killer ride.

MTV music awards Thursday September 6th - Hopefully we get another Britney strip tease this year.

Whoops I did it again,......I'm not that innocent...

After the pain in the ass selling my current car is giving me I am thinking about leasing. Can you work up some lease rates for 24 and 36 months.

Thanx

Chris

I thought you would like it...

It is the end-all be-all of Grand Cherokees.

Retail is $52,300 - your cash price is $45,488 including rebates.

As for Sept 6/7, what I will do is bring down the matching twin of the Jeep
in the Silverstone colour for you to play with.  It is a demo and identical
to the black one other than the exterior colour, so you will be able to see
what you think of it.

How does that sound?

Martin,
 
I left early yesterday. Does tonight work for you? No spoiler and the car was high and dry during Allison.
 
Chris

I would like to meet to see your car.  The evening works best for my wife (going to be her car) so let me know if you are going to be free after 7ish.  By the way, does your car have a spoiler on the back or any extra water from Allison?  
 
I'll probably have a little room but below 28K I'll probably just move it back to Calgary. Let me know if you want to see it. I car pool with Benson so I only have it here every other day.

Looks like new ones are going for $31,000 - what is your real offer.  My wife is looking for a new car so I am seriously interested.

Canadian's Testicles Torn Off, Girlfriend Charged 
TORONTO (Reuters) - A man is recovering from an unwanted birthday surprise after a fight with his girlfriend in which she is alleged to have yanked his testicles so hard she tore them from his scrotum, the Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday. 
The 46-year-old man had just returned from birthday celebrations early Monday morning in Pickering, east of Toronto, when, according to police, he and his girlfriend got into a fight. 
"Last we heard, last night he was at Pickering Ajax Hospital waiting for surgery to have them put back on," police told the Globe. "That was quite the birthday present he got." 
The woman was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, the paper reported. Police are not releasing her name, to protect the identity of her partner. 
"It must have been one hell of a pull," Philip Kotz, a Toronto urologist, told the paper. "I've heard of the slicing off of a penis but the pulling out or off of the testicles by a spouse or a human is pretty uncommon. I've never seen one and I've been in practice for 50 years." 
There was no word on the man's condition or chances for full recovery, but doctors said it all depends on the amount of damage to the area. 
"If the testicles are pulled right off then it's goodbye Charlie, they're gone. He's not going to have any testicles," Dr. Kotz told the Globe." If, on the other hand, the scrotum was pulled off -- that's the bag that holds the testicles -- and the testicles are intact then it's not a big deal to sew the scrotum back on, depending on how badly it was wrenched off." 
Similar to this incident was the case of John Wayne Bobbit, whose wife sliced off his penis and threw it into a field in 1993. Bobbit's penis was surgically reattached and he went on to star in an adult film. 

And half the miles this one has.

Thanx.

Chris,

I have included a "TCPL Map"  that includes the Alliance pipeline.  Alliance data lags one day behind today's date so the flows on the Alliance pipeline for today appear as 0.   

 << File: opspackage.xls >> 
Regards,
Ian

Thanx Sherry

Hey Chris,

     How are you doing? Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner regarding
Stickley, but I was doing research to see if I could find any information
about the company.  Unfortunately, I had no success.  I have contacted Mega
group, (our buying group) to see if perhaps they had any information, but...
again another brick wall.  I cannot find a web site, or any listing in
"Furniture Today" (a listing of all manufacturers in the U.S.)  If I come
across anything I will let you know.  Do you know what pieces in particular
this fellow is looking for?  Perhaps we could source another vendor.??
     If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to call, email,
fax, or send message via messenger pigeon; whichever method you perfer.

Looking forward to your next contact.

E.T.   (better known as Sherry).

I love it still.  What else are you going to own in Canada???

How about TD Bank? Benson and I own some wood.

What are you driving these days? I'm selling my car cheap because it will cost me a fortune to take it back to Canada. 2001 Lexus IS 300 Silver with Black leather interior. Totally loaded with 3800 miles on it. Let me know if you or any of your buddies want to check it out.

Chris

Nice looking truck. Is this one the same price? About $45,000? I will be working out of my Calgary office on Sept.6/7. Could you bring it downtown to take me for a ride on the afternoon of the 6th?

Mike,

I don't have your work number. Walker flaked on dinner (did I call that or what). I am coming to town Feb 2. I'll give you a call next week with the details.

Chris

Picture didn't come through. Sounds nice. Is there somewhere on the web I can see it.

Chris

Did the picture not come through as an attachment in my last email?

I'll attach it again and hopefully you will be able to see it this time.

If not, it is the 60th Anniversary Limited - black exterior with the taupe
and agate interior...I thought it would be a good match for you and there
are only a few around and they are gorgeous.

Do you have a black one in stock? If so, what color interior? 

Chris

Hi Chris,

So you like black?  Oddly enough that was the one I was thinking of too...

Here's a picture...What do you think?

By the way, I will be here on the 6th and 7th, so I will see you then.

Take care,

Yeh! Sept.6-7 Try to find a sub. This is Johnny we're talking about.

You mean sept 6-7 right? I'll see if that works for Johnny.  I have beach volleyball on Thursdays so I'll have to find a sub.

The colors that interest me most are black, silver, white, burgundy and champagne. I will be in Calgary on Sept. 6/7 and I will give you a call. Are you going to be in the office on those days?

Chris Dorland

Hi Chris,

I don't honestly know how long they will be available as our first 2002
arrived on Monday, so that would suggest that we aren't receiving any more
2001 models.  There are still several available, but if we didn't have your
2001 in stock, I would locate it at another dealer and bring it in for the
same price.

The next step might also be to give me your top choices for colours so I can
keep an eye out for you.

By the way, my work number is 730-4000, or toll-free 1-866-881-1888.

Take care,
Dwayne

Hey,

Just got back from some time off.  Congrats on the house.  Where did you buy?  When are you coming up?  I'll let you know all the details of the offsite as soon as we know - it should be a good time.

What are the details of this offsite? Make sure to count me in. Bought a house this weekend. No sense wasting any time. I'll call you later.

Chris

I bought a place in Altadore / River Park. Right near where Blair lives. #402 3511 14a st. SW. Great place and great area. I'll be in the office next Thursday and Friday and then I am back in Houston for a week. Start in Calgary Monday the 17th for good. See you next week.

Is our 401K plan administered by Paine Webber? If not, who? Just wondering who I need to contact in order to roll into and IRA.

Thanx

Chris

Absolutely.  When is you term date here in the USA so I can use this date to run the calculation?

Also, here is the information you requested

401k

When you return to Canada, you can either roll over your 401k to qualified IRA or you can request a distribution from Northern Trust. If you choose to receive the distribution, you will be taxed 20% Federal and then 10% penalty.  Northern Trust @ 800-316-7526

The Cash Balance Plan

Kim,

Could you please get me a schedule of my oustanding options and restricted stock including grant price and vesting dates.

Thank you,

Chris

Matt,

That is cool. I can't really change the trip but I am sure I will be back in Vancouver soon. Send me your vitals and I'll let you know the next time I am in town. Or give me shout if you are ever out in Calgary. Do you have Atkinson's office phone number? I seem to have misplaced it.

in Calgary. I'm moving back on September 15th to trade gas again for Enron.

Hi Chris,

I am attaching the breakdown on a Grand Cherokee that matches your request
as closely as possible.

The MSRP on the unit is $51,570 with pretty well every conceivable option -
I can get you this Grand Cherokee for the cash price of $45,188 including
rebates.

Take a look at the attachment and let me know if you have any questions or
comments.

Have a great day,

Dwayne

Brad,

I need to top up my RRSP for 2001. My contribution limit from my tax return for 2000 is $10881. I have contributed about $5500 through Enron and Enron has contributed $3200 to my pension plan. Am I correct to assume that I can contribute about $2000. The part I wasn't sure about was the pension contributions. Let me know and I will send you a check.

Chris

PS I am going to Vancouver next weekend to look at buying a sweet Porsche

I just signed and faxed the release of conditions. No getting rid of me now. Hope your girlfriend can cook for 3.

Go ahead, no court in the land would convict you given the proximity to
Blair. Drove by and egged the place last night, looks good....

I didn't know Blair lived up there. Do you think it's too late to flake on
the deal?

                        Winter

Thanx Laura. I need to change about 125-150k USD is that OK.

Chris

No problem.  Come see us when you want it done.

Laura,

I don't know if you have heard but I am moving back to Calgary to trade gas. I am coming back in mid-september. Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back? I would like to avoid the Royal Bank's huge bid / offer spread. Let me know. 

Thanx

Chris

Tricia,

I think I gave you the wrong fax number for Terri O'Laughlin at the Royal Bank. The correct number is 403-292-2182.

Thanx

Chris

Kim,

Any word on what happens to my 401k and/or savings plan when I transfer back to Calgary? Let me know.

Thanx,

Chris

I didn't know Blair lived up there. Do you think it's too late to flake on the deal?

Got the pictures. Thank you very much. Do you stock those wheels and tires or would I have to order them?

Chris Dorland

Chris,
Can you please e-mail me your address in Huston and I'll send you some
pictures of the tires.
Tamara (Lexus Service)

Tamara,

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to
get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there
somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car
winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give
you a call then.

Chris Dorland
    -----Original Message-----
   Chris,

   Please disregard my last e-mail. I guess I completely misunderstood your
   message. I just need to know if your tires are 16 or 17 inch. If the are
   17
   inch you will need wheels and tires, but if they are only 16 inch then
   tires
   are all you need. Reason being, it is recommended that the IS300 is
   driven
   with 16 inch tires in the winter time. For pricing you are looking at
   $1686.00+gst
   (17 inch) and $746.00+gst (16 inch). The brand of tires that are
   recommended
   are Michelin Pilot Alpine Roh extreme wheel.
   If you need any other information please e-mail or phone @ (403)291-2111
   Tamara (Lexus Service)

   Al,

   I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a
   winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you
   recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find
   something that would work. Thanx for your time.

Dawn,

I got your package yesterday and I signed the offer letter and will return it today. I wasn't sure what to do about the employment agreement because I signed a 2 year contract in April that is a little more detailed and restrictive that the one you sent. The main differences are with regards to the non-compete agreement (3.4) and termination before end of term (2.1). If you want I can include a copy of that contract with the offer letter. Let me know what you want me to do.

Thanx

Purchase. No financing necessary.

Hi Chris,
Thank you for your quote request  on the Grand Cherokee.
I am just getting some numbers for you and I was  curious if you had decided if you were looking to purchase, finance, or  lease.
Just let me know and I will put together all the options for you  so you can see the different costs and/or monthly payments and decide what works  for you.
Thanks very much,

Where is you place? It is pretty close to there isn't it.

Sweet, don't forget river park, the tropicana and marda loop, let alone my
favorite icecream store. Sweet, I like those places, walked through one
about a year ago. Good work. Congrats. I'll have to take you to the trop for
a few beers and some pizza....lets not forget the library, firehall and sand
volleyball courts (chickas) right up the road

Laura,

I don't know if you have heard but I am moving back to Calgary to trade gas. I am coming back in mid-september. Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back? I would like to avoid the Royal Bank's huge bid / offer spread. Let me know. 

Thanx

Chris

Dad,

Just though I would let you know I talked to a Royal Bank credit specialist this morning and he will get back to me this afternoon. I also talked to Jordan and he is going to take call Linda and get going on the paper work. I think I am going to come back to Calgary September 6-7 to finalize everything. There is an Enron Canada offsite in Banff that weekend (Sept 7-9) that I should go to. Thanx again for all your help this weekend.

Chris

Nathan / Judy

PWC prepared my Canadian and US tax returns for 2000. I was expecting approx. a $1800 return on my US federal income tax that I haven't received yet. Do you have a number / contact that I can direct my inquiry to? 

Thanx,

Chris Dorland

A lucent phone will be fine. I will only be on the desk for about 7-8 days so don't go to too much trouble. Do you have Keith and Frank's flight info for their trip to Calgary on Sept. 7 ? I will be there that weekend as well and want to coordinate my return with theirs.

Thanx,

Hi Chris,

Mike Grigsby has told me that you will be seating with the West Gas Trading Group for a couple of weeks beginning Sept. 1.  Will you be working off of a laptop for those two weeks?  I will make sure that you have the connections you need at the desk you will be sitting at and I will have a lucent phone setup for you.  Please forward me your extension, current location and badge number so I can setup the move.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.  

Will a lucent phone be okay or will you need to be setup on a turret?

What are the details of this offsite? Make sure to count me in. Bought a house this weekend. No sense wasting any time. I'll call you later.

Chris

I like that area. Nice and quiet. 6 blocks to Original Joe's. Didn't have the carrot cake but the soup was excellent. 

Nice, did you have the carrot cake? Sept 15th, hmm I'll put my party dress
on.....

I had lunch at bell's cafe yesterday. They are the red brick townhouses on
14a st. Moving back Sept. 15.

Kim,

I am going to be moving back to the Calgary office in about a month and I wanted to touch base with you so we can organize any HR issues before I go. In particular I was wondering what happens to my Enron savings plan (401k) when I go back. Let me know if there is anything you need me to do for you.

Chris

The market here for tommorow's close is 36 at 38.

Milly just told us too.  I hope the market doesn't hate that news.

The patented move is starting to pay. This just in. Skilling resigns for personal reasons. Wow!

What is the specific appeal of distressed debt? If you are going to trade debt or equities GS is the place to be.

Nicely done with the email.

What do you think of my next career move (still a few years away) --
distressed debt trader at Goldman Sachs.

I found a guy who will hire me and I think I want to do it (mostly 'cause
no chicks do), but will have to wait until I am willing to stop partying
until all hours during the week (i.e. a few years away).  You really do
have to come visit while I am here.  I can't see moving any time soon, but
that being said I am thinking about putting some time in in London and/or
Paris at some point, so we'll have to see.  Why don't you do your
Amsterdam/Paris/London trip in late Nov when I am thinking of doing
mine....those are the three cities I was thinking of hitting on mine
anyway.  We oculd meet up.  DIdn't know you were going to that wedding this
w/e.  Say HI to my parents for me.  And TOm and Vicky Liles.  And my little
bro.  Johnny Zuk is engaged too, hey?  Does Dan have a g.f.?  31 isn't too
old...Are you going to go visit her?  I should go save this company from
the depths o fbankrupt despair now.  LAter.

Chris.Dorland@enron.com on 08/14/2001 03:29:23 PM

Jill,

Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy. What is
with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of
working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week.
Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading
operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston
so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our
Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that
hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the
world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and
sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of
natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. Houston has good restaurants,
decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I
would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will
find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while
I can.

Kerrie got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is
dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a
while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for
me anyway (31).

Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to
visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would
like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination.
Or is NY home for a while?

No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this
weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit
when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live
in Calgary in Friday. My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to
do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little
Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.

My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US
and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and
buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been
playing lots of golf and feeling great.

How is Meg doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her.
I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her.
I hope all goes well for her. Dan did go to D's wedding. Said it was really
nice. Still don't get that one?

I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt. Keep in touch.

Chris

(this e-mail is record length for me)
    -----Original Message-----
   That's it?  That's all I get after all this time?
   How are you?
   Good to hear you are excited to go back to Calgary, if that is where you
   are headed next.
   I am in Virginia at the moment working at client's office (a troubled
   telecom company; like they're not a dime a dozen).  Nice to stay in a
   hotel
   and live for free for a change.  For the past few weeks I have been
   living
   the life of a consultant, flying to VA for Tues through Thurs and in the
   office Mon and Fri.  I don't mind.  It's good for the pocketbook and for
   the frequent flyer points.  Plus it works out that I get all my weekends
   off that way.

   Why back to Calgary?

   Have you heard the big news?  It is only a few days old so I am sure you
   haven't, but Kerrie got engaged.

   Are you engaged?  Just asking because everyone but me is, it would
   appear.
   Any new news in that department for you?  I have started seeing someone
   new, but it is really casual and really new.  He is another lawyer and
   from
   St. Albert, Alberta of all places!  Met him at a cocktail part for
   Canadian
   lawyers working in New York.  Speaking of which, I am coming up on my
   one
   year anniversary of living here (and of having a real job) and am loving
   both living here and work.  No complaints.  Am off to my best friend
   from
   law school's wedding in Vancouver in Sept so I am taking a week off
   then,
   other than that no big vacay planned for the summer.  And you?  I do
   plan
   on going to visit a close friend who is moving to Paris in the fall so
   I'll
   likely go for American Thanksgiving, but that's about it.

   Meghan was here visiting when she was back in June.  Liles came to town
   the
   same w/e.  Shauna Snow (who is also engaged) and Jackie Boase came here
   for
   a visit as well in early May.  We had a blast, of course.  Liles came as
   well that w/e.  The parents made their first trip to the big city in
   March
   and had a fabulous time and have already planned their top ten things to
   do
   during their next visit.  It has been a good year for having people come
   visit (even though my dorm room at UofA was bigger than my apt, we all
   survived).

   How is your fam?  Dev said he was at Matt's stag party and Danny came
   home
   and surprised him.  That's cool.  I guess that wedding is this w/e.  Did
   he
   go to Dion and Suzanne's wedding?  My mom got a kick out of calling me
   to
   say she was going to my first ex-boyfriend's wedding that day.  What are
   Kent and Judy up to this summer?  How's their health?  (wasn't sure how
   to
   pluralize that).  How is Dan liking TO?

   There.  Now you have no choice but to write back a longer, more
   informative
   email.

   Later

   Hope you're well and not working too hard -- even early retirement isn't
   worth it!

   Chris.Dorland@enron.com on 08/14/2001 01:43:21 PM

   Subject:  RE: Interesting Read

   For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my
   work.
   It's all about the $$$. Work hard and retire early.

   Cheers

   Chris

   P.S. I am moving back to Calgary in about a month. Enron continues to
   feel
   free to move me around at will. I am actually really looking forward to
   it.

Chris

Chris,

Just wanted to touch base before you come down this weekend.  I am going to
Phil's stag in the Shuswap on Friday, but will be coming back on Sunday
around supper time.  Your mom said that you are staying until Monday, so
hopefully you'll be around to go out for supper or grab a movie Sunday night
when I get back.  Good luck house hunting, and I'll give you a phone call on
Sunday on my way home.

Ryan
P.S.  Try to find a place that has a nice guest suite...you know ensuite
with jacuzzi tub etc...

Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy. What is with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week. 
Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. Houston has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can. 

Kerrie got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for me anyway (31). 

Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination. Or is NY home for a while? 

No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday. My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.

My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.

How is Meg doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her. I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her. I hope all goes well for her. Dan did go to D's wedding. Said it was really nice. Still don't get that one? 

I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt. Keep in touch. 

Chris

(this e-mail is record length for me)
That's it?  That's all I get after all this time?
How are you?
Good to hear you are excited to go back to Calgary, if that is where you
are headed next.
I am in Virginia at the moment working at client's office (a troubled
telecom company; like they're not a dime a dozen).  Nice to stay in a hotel
and live for free for a change.  For the past few weeks I have been living
the life of a consultant, flying to VA for Tues through Thurs and in the
office Mon and Fri.  I don't mind.  It's good for the pocketbook and for
the frequent flyer points.  Plus it works out that I get all my weekends
off that way.

Why back to Calgary?

Have you heard the big news?  It is only a few days old so I am sure you
haven't, but Kerrie got engaged.

Are you engaged?  Just asking because everyone but me is, it would appear.
Any new news in that department for you?  I have started seeing someone
new, but it is really casual and really new.  He is another lawyer and from
St. Albert, Alberta of all places!  Met him at a cocktail part for Canadian
lawyers working in New York.  Speaking of which, I am coming up on my one
year anniversary of living here (and of having a real job) and am loving
both living here and work.  No complaints.  Am off to my best friend from
law school's wedding in Vancouver in Sept so I am taking a week off then,
other than that no big vacay planned for the summer.  And you?  I do plan
on going to visit a close friend who is moving to Paris in the fall so I'll
likely go for American Thanksgiving, but that's about it.

Meghan was here visiting when she was back in June.  Liles came to town the
same w/e.  Shauna Snow (who is also engaged) and Jackie Boase came here for
a visit as well in early May.  We had a blast, of course.  Liles came as
well that w/e.  The parents made their first trip to the big city in March
and had a fabulous time and have already planned their top ten things to do
during their next visit.  It has been a good year for having people come
visit (even though my dorm room at UofA was bigger than my apt, we all
survived).

How is your fam?  Dev said he was at Matt's stag party and Danny came home
and surprised him.  That's cool.  I guess that wedding is this w/e.  Did he
go to Dion and Suzanne's wedding?  My mom got a kick out of calling me to
say she was going to my first ex-boyfriend's wedding that day.  What are
Kent and Judy up to this summer?  How's their health?  (wasn't sure how to
pluralize that).  How is Dan liking TO?

There.  Now you have no choice but to write back a longer, more informative
email.

Later

Hope you're well and not working too hard -- even early retirement isn't
worth it!

For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my work.
It's all about the $$$. Work hard and retire early.

Cheers

Chris

P.S. I am moving back to Calgary in about a month. Enron continues to feel
free to move me around at will. I am actually really looking forward to it.

I just heard from a mutual friend that Kerrie Murray got engaged recently. Scratch that one off the list of possibles.

Funny that's what I was thinking...

I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle. I might just sell the
car and get you to drive me around all winter.

Glad to hear all is well. I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses. It isn't about finding the meaning of life at work. It is all about the $$$. Work hard. Make $$$. Retire young. Things with me are great. Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go. Take care. 

I don't hear from you in months and then you level me with such a thought
provoking, soul searching article.  Thanks for thinking of me to send it to.
  I really enjoyed reading it.  We certainly fit into certain parts of the
article.  There are a few life theories like that which working through.
Its all interesting stuff.

How are things going with you?  Are you enjoying Houston?

London has been great.  Brokering over here has been pretty rewarding.
Traders over here seem to have a lot more respect for other humans.
Catriona is well and has landed herself a pretty cool job in PR.

Keep in touch,

Mike

I was confused by your use of 2 spellings. Did you like my Austin Power's reference? "I know. That's how we do it in Belgium. It's called a Belgium dip" You are back in my good graces. Try not to confuse the dumb fat kid.

Chris,
Can you please e-mail me your address in Huston and I'll send you some
pictures of the tires.
Tamara (Lexus Service)

Tamara,

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to
get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there
somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car
winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give
you a call then.

   Chris,

   Please disregard my last e-mail. I guess I completely misunderstood your
   message. I just need to know if your tires are 16 or 17 inch. If the are
   17
   inch you will need wheels and tires, but if they are only 16 inch then
   tires
   are all you need. Reason being, it is recommended that the IS300 is
   driven
   with 16 inch tires in the winter time. For pricing you are looking at
   $1686.00+gst
   (17 inch) and $746.00+gst (16 inch). The brand of tires that are
   recommended
   are Michelin Pilot Alpine Roh extreme wheel.
   If you need any other information please e-mail or phone @ (403)291-2111

   Al,

   I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a
   winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you
   recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find
   something that would work. Thanx for your time.

Hopefully I will be able to make it by then. I have to talk to Fletch and Presto but it makes sense for me to be there by then. I am coming to town on Thursday. I'll probably drop by the office on Friday.

Chris

I agree with that.  I actually have short august long Oct for some added kick (hopefully).

When are you getting up here?  I am supposed to plan for that offsite with Holst and Ermis on Sept 7th weekend.  Will you be able to make that???

Mike

Things are look up on the Sept/Oct. Spread I think I am going to add to my position. Cash going out week.

Chris

Mikey,

I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo. I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area. I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst. A couple of people have told me to check out Garrison Woods. Have you heard of it? What is the plan for the weekend. You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have Earl's with the Dorlands. Maybe we could track down Johnny after. Are you taking a chica to the wedding? I am so looking forward to coming home. I got my face ripped off last week. Talk to you later...

Chris

Linda,

I found your email address on the internet so disregard the message I left on your cell. The following properties are the type of place I have in mind. I thought that these would give you a better idea the general concept I am looking for. I am starting to think that a townhouse / infill is a better way to go as opposed to an apartement style condo. I look forward to meeting you on Friday. Below are some MLS #'s of properties that interested me and my contact # in Red Deer / Calary.

Thanx

Congrats on the CFA! Maybe one day I'll get off my lazy ass and give it a shot. 

Chris

Congrats on the CFA. I am actually fighting back today. How much time a week would you say you spend on yard work? I am thinking that I will go with a place more like yours. Let me know what you think. I am going to have to get Monica back.

Oops.

Hey, Mac and I are CFA's.  It is good to be done.

So much for being bullish.

So much for being bullish.

I still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and I don't have the stamina to go out 4 nights a week and get up at 4:30 for work. A little old for my taste as well. She is hot though. She looks exactly like Mariah Carey. It is great hanging out with her. It is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties. Her best friend does the social "buzz" show in Houston's NBC station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town. 

Mcd is great, things are going well for him. Good opportunity for him to
help build their business in Europe. Not married, no kids, got rid of my
roommates, just living solo, still dating the same gal for the last year,
that going well. Mcd is still hounding me to go over there, that fag is
relentless....What happened with the hot chick?

Now that I have a place to live all I need is a chica. I am going to a
wedding in Red Deer next weekend and there should be plenty of available
young ladies there. How is Mike McD? Are you married yet? Any kids on the
way?

Traci,

I am really looking forward to my cooking class. My first one is this Saturday morning. I'm a little scared I am going to be the class screw up. Oh well, I won't know untill I try. I think I am going to Yoga on Wednesday but dinner on Friday would be great. Give me a shout or drop me an e-mail and let me know what time you want to eat and I'll make some reservations. Talk to you soon.

Chris
Good Morning!

I am having a crazy week!  At least it is keeping me out of trouble!
I really enjoyed seeing you again as well.  It is good to see that you are
doing so well!

I have two appointments this week in Calgary.  Wednesday I have two and
Friday afternoon another.  If you want to get together either Wednesday for
Coffee (after 7 sometime) or Friday for a later dinner (after 6 sometime)
let me know.

Good luck with your cooking classes! Hopefully all appendages remain
attached.

Talk with you soon!

Traci

Traci,

Great seeing you again and catching up. Be sure to give me a shout if you
are coming to Calgary. Don't work too hard.

   What up dog?

Actually lots. Keep this on the QT for now but this kid is moving back to cow town. I'll be in town next week shopping for somewhere to live. Just in time for ski season.

What up dog?

I want stag details.

Chris

Not good. Listen to this. At the end of the day dailies traded down to 85 bucks. Check that range 85-275. I need a vacation.

How is that weak baboon heart of yours????

The range on my next day power was 110 to 260.

I'm losing a bit this month too.  Fucking cash to futures too tight!!!  Need the weather to break.

Call me tonight and I'll tell you about my Realtor.

Want to hear about a bad day. Down $2 million USD today. Temps came in 10 degress hotter than we thought in the Northeast this week and blew up!

Chris

Sounds good man.  We should maybe talk on the weekend.

I think a mid sept tee time will work. I want to try to be there for the off site with the west guys. Tell John Z I'll call him this afternoon.

John,

I talked to Fletch yesterday and I think I am going to come back to Calgary. I'll give you a call this afternoon or Monday to talk about details but I just thought I would drop you a note so you could get the ball rolling with HR on your end. Talk to you soon.

I was just yanking your chain. Deep breaths. Go ahead and make whatever adjustments.

Chris

My intentions were not to lose you 30%. If you look at the trail of unrelated
events that unfolded over the last 2 years it is
easy to understand why the mkts have done so badly. This however does not help
people's frustration over the way the markets have performed over the last 2
yrs.

LOOKING BACK (1999-2001)

1. Y2K-	$ spent on technology
                   Gov~t allowed free flow of  money into system

2. DOT COM EXPLOSION-overvalued companies-3-4x- no value-no substance

3. SEPT. 2000- MIDDLE EAST NON-EVENT THREAT of WAR

4. MEDIA- OCT. 1987- comparing today to 1987-self fulfilling prophecy

5.  SOLID TECH COMPANIES 3Q earnings off due to Y2K slow downs

6.   U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

7.   ENERGY CRISIS- led to low retail sales

8.  DEC. 2001 RETAIL SALES DECREASED- worst in 17 years

 9.MEDIA HYPE RE: RECESSION- businesses quit spending

10. SEPT. 11/02- panic, emotions run rapid, sell- drives mkt lower

11. ENRON SCANDAL

LOOKING AHEAD (2002)

DECREASED INTEREST RATES- 12 months to see effects- lowest in 40+ yrs
DECREASED INFLATION
DECREASED INVENTORIES & STAFF
ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENT FISCAL POLICY
IMPROVING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
HISTORICAL RECORDS OF MARKET REBOUNDING

I just want to reposition  some funds you now own so going forward you will
better opportunity for gain.

I personally feel if we have another bad year like the last year you will see
massive layoffs and bankruptcies. In those going broke will be the banks.

bmg

Sherry,

I haven't forgetten about the numbers on the pictures I will send them to you tommorow. A guy in my office was wondering if you can order Stickley furniture through you buying group. Can you let me know if you get a second. 

Thanx

Chris

Nov-Mar Sumas has moved about 0.20 since I started watching it. I guess that's enough vol. for me.

Chris

The guy who ran our trading operation in Calgary really wanted to move back to Houston because his girlfriend lives hear so that left a hole in our Calgary trading operation so they asked me to come back. See you in a couple of weeks.

Chris

Chris,

No, I hadn't heard, but from my end, selfishly, that's great news!  What
happened, because last I heard from your mom, you had signed on for 2 or 3
(poor memory on my part) years in Houston.  We should arrange some golf
while you're back if there's time.  I'll give you a call next week to touch
base...I'm going to Panorama for a few days with Cari tonight, but will be
back next Tuesday.

Talk to you later,
Rye

Thanx for getting back to me so quickly. I am looking for something about 1300-1500 sq. feet with one bedroom plus den or 2 bedrooms. The price range I was thinking was $225-250 K. Hope that helps. I will give you a call later in the week .

Mike, 

I wish I was there to witness Dan in action. I will be next year for sure. Can't wait to see Johnny. Hopefully there are some single hotties at the wedding. There hasn't been a cougar sighting recently. Better hop. Talk to you later...

Chris

Buddy, 
Things are good.  I am going out for lunch today with our corporate finance group.  I'm thinking of moving down there.  The wedding should be a gong show.  Golf trip to BC was amazing!  Greywolf is quite a track.  How's the stalker?  Still phoning in the odd booty call?  I'm back with mine.....I'm weak.   Good to see your bro - he did some vintage "wheeling" when he was down, it was sweet.  Take care, see you soon.  Johnnie says hi and he is looking forward to seeing you.  Later

What's going on? I hope school is going well. I am sure you have heard but things are getting back to normal around here. I think working for UBS is going to be really good. Seems like the cultures are going to mix really well. I am thinking about buying a porsche. I really like the 993's but I don't really like the 996's. Looking around for a nice low km 1994-97 C4. Anyway don't work too hard and keep in touch.

Chris

Mike,

What's going on? It is hot as shit down here. I had to get a new # because that crazy cougar was stalking me. It is 713-665-8145. Just kidding my old phone company went belly up. I am really looking forward to Matt and Jen's wedding. I bought a new lampshade to wear. Be sure to get Matt all fucked up on the stag. Talk to you later.

This is good if you have a minute.  Remember if you guess it is a girl you
put chic in the grey box...not chicK (leave off the K) or it doesn't take
it.  I got 16 out of 20 right....couple of 'em fooled me.  Good luck.
You may want to make sure no one is looking over your shoulder.

Good Luck! hehe

En un esfuerzo para prepararte para enfrentar a este mundo,
te envio este test para que ver si estas preparado para enfrentarlo.....
El objetivo es determinar si la foto corresponde a un hombre = dick o
a una mujer = chic
Buena suerte

Sorry it took so long to get back to you. My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs. Lots of fun. I'm glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation. Are you over your cold yet? It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July. I didn't do anything exciting of the 4th. I watched the NY fireworks on TV. We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest. Better get back but I'll write back later.

Chris

Hey Chris!!  My trip was great.  We had soooo much fun but it flew by.  I
have a good video you will have to watch.  I got back to work last Thursday
and was thrown immediately into a deal that was closing on Friday and to top
it off I wasn't feeling well once I got back here.  I think someone on the
plane was sick and gave me a cold.  So I rested over the weekend and then I
have had a complete week from hell this week.  I have been meaning to touch
base with you!  I didn't even do anything for the 4th of July.  Did you
watch the fireworks??  I was hoping to get out of here early but I don't
think I am going to have that much luck.  I am in town doggie sitting right
now.  I may actually be moving on the 15th of the month back inside the
loop.  What do you have going on for the weekend?  I am hoping I don't have
to come up here.

Crystal

Crystal,

How was your trip? I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat.
We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better
destination. Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the
humidity. Can't wait. Take it easy.

As you know, I gave up  my 3 month vacation as a beach bum a few weeks ago, and have joined the real world again (definately prefer the bum lifestyle!!).   And after a record-breaking move that started at 10pm and ended at 6:00am, I am now settled into a place back on the westside. As always, my door is open (literally), if you are looking for some California sun.

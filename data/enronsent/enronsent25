I'll send a cleaned up version to Mike tomorrow am.

Thanks,

Kay

Yes, such as the side letter, assignments, etc.  That may be about it, but I 
don't trust my memory.  Since there is so much to do in such a short time, 
lists help!

Thanks,

Kay

Yes.  I will get these out to you either late tonight or early tomorrow.
With regard to your earlier request for a closing list for moving the
Turbines out of the West LB Agreement, what are you referring to that
was not included in Chris Cobb's memo yesterday? 

Paul/Peter,

Me again.  I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday.  Could you make me a
list of issues like you did with the GE contract (removing the comments
from the text), and blackline the new clean "commentless" version
against
the original master contract.

Thank you,

Kay

I've found CompareRite to work with long documents.  Plus, these documents 
started out as WordPerfect documents and were converted to Word, which I 
think creates problems with Word comparisons.  I figure it is a Gates 
conspiracy...

Kay

Yours is much better.

Here's the blackline I prepared, so you can see which looks better.

What an awful mess.

We also used CompareRite.  However, when the system swithched over the
weekend, our current tool bars no longer work with Word as presently
configured. In addition, those documents that had automated headings.
etc. now are incompatible with the new versions.  We are having an
outside vendor try to clean the documents up so that they will be
compatible and Houston IT is working on fixing our tool bars.

I've made changes to the attached document. I modified the prior draft so 
that the Purchase Amount is reduced by the full amount of the two 
transformers being cancelled ($1.572 million), and so that the Cancellation 
Charge of $323,200 be paid upon execution of the Change Order.

Kay, if you're OK with this, please forward to Sandridge for ABB's review and

Hi Charlotte,

We are going to the Astro's game tonight, so it would be very easy for one of

Ben,

Sorry our schedules aren't lining up too well.  I look forward to finally
getting together on July 18th.  Hope all is proceeding well with securing
sites and permits for the various LM6000 projects.

We continue to support E&CC and NEPCO with pre-engineered Balance of Plant
equipment offerings that help drive their EPC costs and cycle times down.
Some these items were elective options we had already build into the
Equipment contract.  Other items are unique to project design we've gone
back and forth, fine tuning our quote to within the NEPCO EPC budget.

My question is will these items be purchased direct by NEPCO, or will we add
onto the existing contract? Some of this equipment has lengthy leadtimes to
consider and we want to make sure this equipment doesn't delay your in
service date.
Most of the activity has been for the Austin Energy job, but other sites
seeking June 1, 2001 in service date will need the same type of equipment.

One other piece of housekeeping I wanted to attend to yesterday was an
outstanding change order that dates back to March.  At that time, Mike
Miller and Chris Booth ordered some of the optional equipment mentioned
above.  The items are outlined in the attached draft Change Order Number 2.
Actually, it should have been Change Order Number 1 or built into the Base
contract (but we all chose not to delay the contract as your team can
verify.).

We've ordered the chillers, exhaust stacks, and incorporated the dual fuel
option on units #7&8 (these were originally planned for the Electri Cities
deal) and all work is proceeding on or ahead of schedule.  Now, I believe
these dual fuel units are planned for a Florida site, to go with the other 4
Units(#17-20).

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.  If not, please
authorize the processing of Change Order Number 2 with Kathy Clark or Kay
Mann.

In the meantime, I look forward to when we can meet.  If you have any time
today or tomorrow, I could rearrange my schedule to accodate yours.

Best Regards,

Lee Johnson <<ChangeOrder#2.doc>>

Ross/Jackie,

Here's my list of comments to the most recent draft.  It is subject to 
internal review, but this gives you an idea.  Could we have a telephone 
conference to knock out as many of these as possible?  

Thanks,

Kay

Meant to copy you.

Mitch

I talked with Westinghouse this morning.  They have some minor changes to the 
agreement.  They'll have the changes back this afternoon.  If the changes 
reflect what they described on the phone, then we'll be ready to sign 
tomorrow morning.

Mike, are you in tomorrow to sign?

Mitch

Hi Guys,

This is just intended to be a list of issues to be addressed in each project 
specific contract - a "to do" list to finish each one.

Kay

Dale and Kay:

Lee and I looked at the proposed site specific letter and we wondered if
what Dale did for the summary sheet may not be a better format.  Dale, can
you forward it to the Kay and I to look at and consider.

Thanks.

This is the most current clean version of the GE breakout contract.  You have 
also received a list of site specific references in the contract to assist in 
the preparation of the final document.  

I will contact Kent Shoemaker today to see how close we are on the form.  It 
is my understanding that the lawyers involved in the projects will take the 
laboring oar once the form is ready to go.

I'll let you know as soon as I hear something from GE.  I am also trying to 
set up a meeting with ABB today or tomorrow.  I will send you the current 
version of that contract as well, although we have not had any input from ABB 
on it yet.

Hi Mitch,

My suggested changes are highlighted.

Please let me know what else I can do.

Kay

I agree.

   
	
	

Two developments to report:

1.  I received a call from Herb yesterday afternoon.  He asked where 
everything stood.  I told him that Kay was following up with FCE's attorneys 
on the outstanding drafting issues and that I have given my comments on the 
last document to Kay.  I said that I thought that the bulk of the issues 
remaining were either legal or drafting issues (Kay--Do you agree?).  I 
promised that I would call Herb if any material issues arose.  Also, I told 
him that we expected additional comments on the exhibits today.

2.  Terri Austin committed to get back to us with her technical comments on 
the exhibits today.

Please let me know if there are additional items which I can be of assistance.

You are right on all points (especially the punting one!).  You should have 
the list of specific "fill in the blank" stuff which I forwarded recently.  
Also, we had a discussion yesterday with GE on the form of the 
assignment/assumption agreement, so there shouldn't be anything required of 
you from that standpoint.  

I'm here today (wasn't yesterday) and will be happy to discuss it with you.

Kay

Kay,

I recognize that you would like to punt this "break out contract" thing as 
soon as possible; but, I would like to visit with you briefly about how any 
transition might work.  As I appreciate it, once the form of break out 
contract is complete, most of the hard work is done.  What types of 
modifications are envisioned for each of the break outs?  I assume that just 
a few things would change (for example (i) price, (ii) number of units, (iii) 
delivery points, and (iv) a pro rating of LD's).  Am I grossly 
underestimating the amount of work that will be required.  Please advise.

Stuart

I suggest we give GE a time line for completing each of the break out 
contracts.  I'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements, so I'm 
asking  your help.  I believe City of Austin is ready to go as soon as the 
form is complete, and it could be a great candidate for working on 
immediately.  I know the ESA project has some time sensitivity as well.

Please let me know what you think.  

Kay

I left Kent a message, suggesting that we start with COA, telling him ENA is 
the assignee.  I'll let you know when I hear from him.

Kay

Just as we discussed.  Thanks

Are they still available?

Thanks.

I'll give you a call in a little while to compare notes, status, etc.

Kay

Maybe it is Lisa Alfaro.  If you prefer that an ENA lawyer handle it, I will 
volunteer.  Your plate is more full than mine (I just ate at the luncheon, 
and I'm thinking in food metaphors.) 

Kay

Am I the deal lawyer for the ESA turbines?

I guess the ESA lawyers have decided that this is not the time to outsource 
project work!

We are to the point where we need Ben to help pull the technical and 
financial details together.  I'll see what I can do to get his attention.  

Dan is still in the midst of his health issues, so he is fasting in 
anticipation of a 230 physical.  Roger Balog brought a pumpkin cheesecake 
which was delicious, and one of clerks made the best collard greens I had 
ever had.  I am miserable - which means I ate a lot more than greens and a 
piece of cheese cake.  

Kay

Lisa Alfaro has transferred all of her responsibility for Electrobolt to John 
Novak?  Bless you if you could get the breakout contract done.  I would 
really appreciate it since I'm spanning both coasts and multideals.  Sorry I 
had to miss lunch.  Did Dan bake his blueberry or cranberry bread?

Ben,

Has the payment allocation chart been updated, and if so, could I get a copy?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi guys,

I thought it would be a good idea to come up with an plan of action to get 
the facility agreements closed out.  From what I can tell here, the ESA and 
City of Austin deals are the most time sensitive.  

Sounds great to me.  If we need Ben, it will need to be after noon eastern.  
If it is just us chickens anytime after 930 your time is good for me.

So?
It's time to renew the season tickets for the Astros.  There are 81 home
games next season and the cost for the four seats is $9,628, or $118.86 per
game.  The location of the seats is as last year.

Let me know how many games you're in for.  I'll need checks payable to the
Houston Astros by December 15.

Hope all is well.  I haven't forgotten you!

I never would have guessed smoked oysters.  I think I'm cooking for the 4 of 
us, plus Lena and any stray friends we find.  We will probably come to 
Palacios on Saturday and spend the night, although I haven't discussed it 
with Mom yet.

It is dreary here today, but in a nice way.  I don't mind it too much, 
although by Sunday we may be stir crazy.  

We went to Michael's school on Wednesday, as his class was singing in 
chapel.  Roger Clements was there, video cam in hand, doing the dad thing.  
He is a really big guy, much bigger than I thought.  He looks like a football 
player.  I see why Piazza didn't take a swing!

I would say "break a leg" for Katie, but with your groups orthopedic 
problems, I hesitate to use the phrase!

Love,

Kay

FYI.  I believe we need your help with preparing the first two breakout 
contracts - one for the City of Austin project, and one for the ESA project.  
I heard yesterday that they want the ESA contract by November 22, and the COA 
shortly thereafter.

I expect to talk to Kent today about where we are on the form, and how to 
move forward to closure.

Thanks for the current draft contract.  I have gone through it and plugged in 
the relevant information I have from the Summary Sheet that GE approved 
earlier.  

What I don't have, and am most interested in obtaining from whatever source 
has them, are the following:

 1. Purchase price information (based on the current outstanding balance)
 2. Payment schedule (based on current outstanding balance) for Section 6.1.2.
 3. The massive volume of specifications and GE boilerplate that is to be 
attached to the contract as Exhibits and Schedules.
 4. A form for Exhibit U, setting out the correct site-adjusted information 
for these 4 turbines.
 5. Unit number identifications and guaranteed delivery dates for each of the 
turbines.  

We are prepared to fill in the unit-specific information beyond that which we 
have already incorporated in the body of the document, and can fill in 
specific numbers in Exhibit U, but need to have the remaining information.

Please note that there appears to be a couple of residual references in the 
contract that may not or are not relevant to all contracts.  

First, Section 10.10.6 (regarding maximum aggregate liquidated damages) 
references 30% of the Purchase Amount.  It should be 30% of the Maximum 
Liability Amount (according to the summary GE approved earlier).

Second, the contract provides for "Optional Electrical Output Guaranty" and 
associated liquidated damages in 10.7.3.  This guaranty by its terms applies 
only to installations utilizing 6 or more turbines.  I have deleted it from 
the LV contract.

In addition, Bill Williams has told me that the site-adjusted performance 
levels that GE provided for the summary information sheet are different (and 
less favorable to the project ) than those GE provided him in other 
documents.  We will need to confirm those numbers with GE.

Is there a contact point at GE whom we should talk with about getting the 
information/Exhibits we need, or do we have the information already?

Please let me know.  We are in serious need of providing a document to our 
prospective purchaser.

Here is the most recent (and dare we hope last?) draft of the ABB agreement.  
Kathy Clark is preparing a redline for your use, and you should have it 
shortly.

ABB may be insistent upon dating this June 30, but we will try the 7th with 
an effective date of the 30th. Ben advises that this is a very, very critical 
point to ABB.

I have not taken ABB's comment on the assignment language, but I hope they 
will accept what we've given them in this draft.

I have been advised that the price reduction is due to more definitive design 
criteria being provided by Enron.

Matt Gockerman points out that their is exposure to Missouri sales tax, so we 
will need WestLB's cooperation in getting the proper exemption certificate 
for MO.

Have I forgotten to address any questions or comments?

I just spoke with GE's counsel, and here's where we are:

Change the following for the final draft:
1.80  delete "remaining"
10.2.1  take out the note

Otherwise, GE had no comments.

Peter/Chris,

If you look on the spreadsheet I sent you earlier, it gives the unit numbers 
for each of the projects.  You can figure out the guaranteed delivery dates 
by matching up the delivery dates from the contracts with the number.  Also, 
please fix the use of purchase amount in 10.10.6 as suggested by Dale.

The ESA deal has a change order associated with it (change order 3, attached 
below) and that CO is not reflected in the amounts to be paid.  

City of Austin has no change orders.  The assignee is Enron South America.

our contact with GE tends to be indirect through turnkey contractors on power 
plants: the turnkey contractor usually contracts with GE instead of Enron as 
owner. So this would probably not be high on our list of priorities, although 
we would be interested to see what you come up with. 

You might want input to your process from our engineering team, lead by John 
Chappell, so I have copied this to John.

Greetings,

I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more 
standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.  The goal is to 
develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the 
same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.  Sheila 
has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might 
find interesting and/or helpful.

You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.  Please 
let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.

Thank you,

Kay

Hi again,

Could you send Rev 10 to Mike S?  

Thanks,  Kay

I wanted to pass along the resume of Carlos Sole. Carlos and I worked 
together extensively at EECC.  The "reorganization" of EECC has him moving to 
EES, but he would prefer to work here.  He recently met with V. Sharp, and 
she understands that he wants to explore opportunities at EWS (I'm learning 
the new nomenclature).  John Schwartzenburg understands this as well.

I can recommend Carlos as a solid, intelligent, hard working lawyer. He's a 
great guy and I believe he would fit in well here.

Thanks,

Kay
Kay, as we've discussed before, I'm interested in pursuing the opportunities 
available in the ENA legal group.  As you know, my experience at EECC in 
addition to focusing on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture 
agreements, has also included cross-border financing agreements and merger 
and acquisition activity.  Before coming to Enron as you recall, I worked 
with a New york based firm here in Houston where I focused mostly on 
transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions 
involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's 
electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, 
I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in DC where I focused on 
general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business 
entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and 
securities offerings.  Thanks for your help.

Hi,

Got your voice mail, and it reminded me to sent this out.  I don't know what 
is up with Jeff, so why wait to send this?

Next comes Finance/M&A (Lance and Travis).

I'm having lunch with Dan today - want to join us?  We are going to Fox Diner.

Does this project have another name?  I'm not familiar with Fountain Valley. 
Is this the same as PSCO?

Where do we stand in issuing the change order for two additional exhaust 
stacks for the Fountain Valley Power Project?????

I'm packing my office (yes, another move), so I'm generally avialable.  Do 
you want to come over here around 1130, and we'll load up Dan and go.  This 
will be a car trip, as FD is on Taft.

Sounds goood.  What time (I'll get there early) and where do we met as I have 
no idea where the Fox Diner is?

 Eric,  here are some questions from Peter, the AK lawyer who is working on 
the contract. If you can respond by return email, Peter can keep this moving.

1.  Payee and Address for Invoices referenced in Section 6.7.2 of
the Agreement

 2. Section 6.7.1 Agreement reference [you might see if NEPCO has a reference]

 3. For the recitals, what is the kW capacity of its plant and where
is the plant located?

 4. According to the spreadsheet, the Guaranteed Delivery Dates for
Units 9-11 was 10/30/00.  The Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 12 is
11/30/00.  Are these still the dates we are using?

 5. Please provide the serial numbers for Units 9-12 for Section
10.2.1. 

 6. Please provide the names, addresses, etc. for Sections 25.1 and
25.3 

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Peter,

1. I don't think you need to do anything re Enron South America, as Rob 
Taylor is working on that.  Were you asking about ENA? Delaware, 1400 Smith, 
Houston, 77002.
 2.  I don't know who is preparing all the exhibits, as I'm waiting to hear 
from GE.  Don't most of the exhibits just need to be copied?  Is the list you 
gave me of the exhibits which need to be adapted the right place to look?
3. No.  The November payment has been made.  

You should get the other info by email from Eric Boyt.

Thanks,

Kay

I need the following information to complete the City of Austin Facility
Agreement:

1.   Where is Enron South America incorporated and where are its
offices located?

2.   For the recitals, what is the kW capacity of its plant and where
is the plant located?

3.   Please confirm that ENA is preparing all exhibits, including
Exhibit N-3 (which is the original price for each unit).

4.   According to the spreadsheet, the City of Austin doesn't make
any payments after November.  I put the amount due in November under the
January 15, 2001 payment date.   Is that correct? 

5.   According to the spreadsheet, the Guaranteed Delivery Dates for
Units 9-11 was 10/30/00.  The Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 12 is
11/30/00.  Are these still the dates we are using?

6.   Please provide the serial numbers for Units 9-12 for Section
10.2.1.

7.   Please provide the names, addresses, etc. for Sections 25.1 and
25.3 

Dan just dumped me, so we can go any where you want.  Do you have a 
preference?

Kay

see you then

Eric, these are already in my list that I sent you.

Peter,

As for payments, we can state that as of the signing of the agreements, all 
payments have been made.  Sounds ok to me.

Kay

Is Enron South America the assignee for the City of Austin deal?  If so,
I need its place of incorporation and location of its ofices.  As to the
exhibits, I believe most can be copied.  However, at least Exhibit N-3
is deal specific and will list the purchase amount for aech unit for the
calculation of the unit liability amount.  If the November payment has
been made, then the turbines for the City of Austin have been completely
paid for. Should I just put Not Used for Section 6.1.2?

I'm speechless.

I was hoping that you would take the first stab at drafting the 
indemnification language.  In cidentally, I just got off the phone with Karl 
Siverling who seemed surprised that we ahd scheduled a meeting for Monday, 
although he said he is available to come.  He also said that their issues/ 
agenda has been delivered to Brain.  Would you mind checking on this?  Thanks!

That Paul has a cloud over him.  At least he has time to heal before baseball 
season.

We are planning on spending Saturday night.  Neil and I will stay at the B & 
B.

Enjoy this great weather.  I hear more rain is forecast for the weekend - 
hope they are wrong!

Love,

I forgot to tell you Paul was in a wreck Saturday afternoon late. He is
O.K. except for a broken arm. He was with the Mayor of Palacios and his
grandson. They were on the way to the high school and someone pulled out
intothem. Mother

Yes, and I agree.

   
	
	

Did you get my message about the Change Order limitations on FCE?

Fine by me.  I'm supposed to be on vacation this week, but so far I haven't 
done a very good job of it!

   
	
	

I will review the redlined document tonight.  Will that work with your 
schedule?

Please print.

Here is my quick pass through the document (solely FCE's changes).  I will 
read it again tonight.

His last day is tomorrow, not Wednesday.

I am picking up Michael. I hope she can make it too. I thought she was
coming home on Tuesday not Wednesday? His last day is Wednesday, right?
Let's eat out of the frig. Love, NM

Allow yourself a day to pack!  I've had to stop and start, but I just now
finished, and I've only been in the office for a couple of months.

Michael says when Paige gets home he's going to grab her leg and hold on to
her.  She thought it was so cute.  He wants her to visit at the school, but
she hasn't told me whether she can make it.  I suspect getting here by 230
or so would be very difficult.

I've hot.  This packing is hard work!

I had lunch with Carlos - and ate too much.  I need to get focused on my
diet again.  At least I'm walking a lot.

You are picking Michael up, today (only), right?

Love,

Kay

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

Sounds good but I thought you wanted a pickup? Ask where it's located and
if
we can have it checked out if your interested. He doesn't say but I'm
guessing it's an automatic.

I did the walk through with John and Maria this morning. Our folks are
going
to be very please with the new office. NM

Wife's car since new, she got a new one, I got a toy, driveway overloaded

it but.... management has determined that 4 vehicles is too many).  His

Hi Dale,

There is another change order #1 which has been signed by ABB but not Enron, 
relating to the cancellation of a couple of transformers.  I don't think it 
will be signed until next week.

Can this change order be used as incentive to get ABB to the table on the 
breakout contract?  

I'm sending a copy of this to Kathleen Clark at EECC and Ben Jacoby, just to 
make sure there aren't any other change orders floating around.

Ciao,

Kay

Dale Rasmussen@ECT
11/20/2000 05:51 PM
The final (?) draft of Change Order #1 for the Las Vegas transformers under 
the West LB contract is attached.  Please confirm whether this should in fact 
be Change Order #1.  If you see anything else you would like changed, please 
let me know as well.

If everything appears to be in order, I will ask Chris Calger to sign the CO 
and get it off to ABB.

I can be reached on my cell phone at (503) 803-1700.

Thanks.

Is it reasonable to expect that Enron as well as Peoples will be involved in 
the preliminary meetings?

Assuming there is no third party intervention, the approval time will
depend entirely on Staff's approach. In the last year, I handled one
affiliated interest agreement approval, which required only five weeks from
filing to the time of the Order. Staff viewed the agreement as
non-contoversial and wanted to dispose of the matter quickly. In another
case, with staff copperation, the time from filing to approval (expected
today), was nine weeks. On the other hand, when staff perceives an actual
or potential issue, cases can drag on for months. I am handling one
approval proceeding (involving acquisition of a small water utility system)
which is expected to require about nine months to complete. In that case,
staff argued that it needed 3-4 months to complete discoverey and prepare
its direct evidence. Time was also included for two separate rounds of
testimony (which is standard at the ICC), the hearing, briefing, issuance
of Examiner's order, and filing of Exceptions and Replies. If Staff seeks
to schedule all of the available procedural steps (which it can do if it so
chooses), it is difficult to complete a case of this type in less than 6
months. A realistic time frame for a contested case would be 5-9 months. To
avoid this, it is important to meet with the staff early on and resolve
their concerns informally. This should be done, if possible, before the
first scheduling conference (likely to be held about 3 weeks after the
Petition is filed). If agreement is not reached beofre the first conference
with the Hearing Examioner, the established schedule for the case should
build in one or more early status conferences which provide the opportunity
to present a settlement and resolve the matter at an early stage.

Hey Suz,

I'm off to walk my dog.  I'm doing some stuff for Gregg Penman this am, but 
it isn't too bad.  Paige will be home in time to go to lunch, and Michael 
wants her to come visit his school.

Hope all is quiet.  Is Dan OK?

Peter,

Go ahead and complete the draft with what you have, and transmit it to me 
with a list of questions which need to be answered to finish it.

Thanks,

I have not yet received any response from Eric Boyt.  If possible, I
would like to receive that information today or early tomorrow so that I
can complete the agreement and leave the office by close of business
Wednesday.

That reminds me that I had trouble reaching the pedals in your Bronco.

Looks like the changes are relatively minor, but I feel better!
Attached is the "term sheet" with some suggested revisions (identified by
strikethrough and underlining).  We suggest that you simply call the "late
charges" interest rather than any other term.  This type of business
transaction is exempt from the usury statute in terms of any maximum rate
and thus it is best to make it clear that the late charge is "interest"
rather than something else.  The other changes I made were merely to
clarify the method of calculating the interest on overdue amounts.  I note
the the contract you provided does include a provision for interest on
overdue invoice amounts.  Under the contract, interest is the Citibank
prime rate.  I assume you will set this term sheet up as an amendment to
the agreement.

Kay - Here is my attempt to turn the term sheet into something executable.  I 
have accepted all of William Harmon's changes except for the second paragraph 
under amended terms.  William used the wording "The payment late payment 
amount is calculated...".  I changed it to "The payment interest on overdue 
amounts is calculated..." to be consistent with the reference in the above 
paragraph.  I don't think this changes any substance, but I defer to you.  I 
think that is all I changed.  I also added a quick intro. and a paragraph on 
future payments to reiterate this is only for October purchases.  Neither may 
be necessary, let me know.  I am not sure your availability tomorrow, but I 
would love to hear from you ASAP in the morning to get this in front of 
Peoples for signature.  Russell Diamond is coordinating the internal Enron

Good morning.

So did I get moved?  If so, please don't worry about unpacking.  I actually 
prefer to do it myself anyway.

I'm not checking voice mail, so if anyone calls I'm on vacation.  Period.  
I've spoken to Sheila and Gregg Penman, and I'm taking care of what they 
need, but if I take on anything else, I might as well pack Michael up and 
come to the office today.

Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.  See you Monday!

This is the last email I have on the issue of consequentials/LOL.  As I 
recall, we have not agreed to the redaction of the carve out of the LOL for

this for a swap for something?

Folks,

Here is some language for discussion this afternoon.  Please note that this
is being submitted for discussion without full management approval; we're
getting so close to the bone that we'll probably need to take the final
package as a whole through our vetting process

I'm looking through the warranty section now, so perhaps we can discuss that
as well.

Kay, 
I don't have a copy of the GE contract, so I can't look at the sections 
referenced below.  I do have: 

Item #4 below:  I think the guaranteed delivery dates are the still the same, 
as specified in the GE contract:
turbines 9,10,11 October 30, 2000
turbine 12 November 30, 2000
I haven't seen any change orders that amend the delivery dates of these 4 
turbines.

Item #5 below: turbine unit/serial numbers
turbine 9 309266
turbine 10 309307
turbine 11 309376
turbine 12 309398

I've been talking to Rob Taylor at A&K regarding the Austin turbine

What a great idea!  Unfortunately, I bought her something already, which is 
highly unusual for me.

Hope you are enjoying all your guys.

Hi!

Matt is over until 300, Paige is off with Abbey, and I'm waiting for a

How many places should I set at the table tomorrow?

Kathleen,

Is everything ok?  I hope you are just having a nice day to yourself.  What 
perfect weather!

I've heard that the turbines are supposed to be moved out of WestLB today.  
The contract with GE is not quite finished, although it is close.

Do the LM facility agreements for DevCo turbines need to contemplate ENA as 
an agent?  Will it specifically be ENA, or an ENA subsidiary?

Thanks,

Hi there,

In resolving some issues with Westinghouse there was an agreement reached 
concerning the disposition of the Blue Girl turbines, as well as certain 
issues relating to the Gleason and Wheatland facilities.  In connection with 
this agreement I am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning 
resolution of these matters.  As you can see, Westinghouse has requested that 
NEPCO, EEPC and LJM2-Turbine, LLC sign the agreement.

Your comments would be appreciated.

Kay

Some changes.  Can you review and advise?

Attached are SWPC revisions to your proposed letter. Our contracts group
advised to add signatures for all affected parties to the agreement, in
addition to know parties for contracts on Gleason and Wheatland sites, we
have added parties identified in draft Blue Girl contract, Enron input as to
appropriate Enron signatures for the Blue Girl would be appreciated.  Please
call with any concerns.

PS It was great seeing you guys last week.  

Dear Turbine Torture Club Members:

The purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference call 
this Wednesday, November 29 at 130 CT.  The following items have been 
suggested for the agenda:

Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used for 
LM's and Frames, if possible.
Assignment language - new language being tortured within the Enron ranks, to 
GE soon.
Limit of liability, indemnity, etc. - Enron owes GE a position on this.

In addition, it seems to me that the following equipment will be "moving" 
soon:

City of Austin LM's (to be assigned to ENA, then NEPCO)
LM's for the ESA project 
PSCO, LV CoGen, the remaining LM's, Pastoria, Blue Dog (all to DevCo, right?) 

I suggest that we address any commercial, financial or legal issues 
outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines.

There may be others who need to be involved in the call, and there may be 
additional issues.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Kay

Rose,

I suggest putting [brackets] around commercial operation as the date we can 
assign without consent.  As of now commercial operation is not a defined term 
(I hope it will become a defined term), so we may want to agree to a 
different milestone.

Thanks,

Kay

I took the Mike Barnas language and added in all the "unreasonable to 
withhold consent" language from GenPower, to which I added the "financing 
structure" language.

I have attached a red-line, which you will need to "view" rather than 
"launch."  Please let me know asap if you think that this will fly with GE, 
or if the language needs to be softened at all.

Rose

I just don't know how many questions they can come up with.   I've quit 
predicting.

Kay

Yikes. Yep, that looks like it about covers it.  Any chance we will get any 
kind of sign-off on the consent, do you think?

Rose

Attached is a draft of the Consent to Assignment and Agreement relating
to the transfer of certain turbine contracts into the TurboPark
structure.  Please note that the attached is being distributed in
advance of review by Enron and remains subject to its comments in every
respect.

Hi Bob,

I believe I gave on October 24, so I'll go again around Christmas.  I'm glad 
that you've gotten some good news, and here's hoping for a much better 2001!

Kay

You guys must be exhausted with all that activity.  Congratulations on the 
grandbaby.  That's a BIG deal.  My oldest "baby" is 20, a junior in college, 
and my Michael is 6.  Every age is special.

Thanks for the periodic updates about Michael.  He's in my thoughts, so I 
appreciate the info.  

Kay

bob.joyce@kvaerner.com on 11/27/2000 05:40:00 PM
Thanks, Kay.  Really appreciate your efforts.  

Despite Michael's problems, we did have a pretty good year as our oldest
Son was married on September 30 and the first Joyce Grandchild was born
to our Daughter on October 24.

Hi Peter,

Could I get a compared version of the most recent Austin draft against the 
original agreement?

Thanks,

Kay

You should have a  closing party for this one.

Sounds good.

We went to Palacios last weekend.  The water was very silty from the rain, 
and the tide was low.  There were a few black drum, but not much else.  We 
did find a stone crab, which was a first.

Electrobolt + the Summary of terms sheet (ala Dale's on LV II).

Here's a new one.  Michael told me he was hungry (big surprise).  I said, 
"Michael, do you want some turkey?"  He said "No Mom, did you forget that I'm 
a vegetarian?"

I had to leave the room as I couldn't keep from laughing!

Kay

I think he will just tell us that chicken nuggests are vegetables.

Have a safe trip back!

Love,

Hi there,

I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.

Here are some questions/comments:

I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =

rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=

I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially=20
similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.

Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.

I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
=20
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.

I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
he=20
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=

I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20

Hi Carol,

I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but 
only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny 
Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a 
wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut 
case.

Good luck,

Kay

Thanks.

I didn't make any changes to the exhibits, but Paul had early on.  I'll
make sure you get the most recent draft.

Hi Guys,

I can't recall if you have made any revisions to the exhibits.  Please
advise (and resend) if you have.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I have a conflict Wed afternoon.  But can catch up on Thurs with you and
Kent.

Meanwhile, please send me an e-copy of the LM Exhibits.  I can do a
quick
redline of those that change.  I've already marked up w/ red pen, the
ESA
Electrobolt + the Summary of terms sheet (ala Dale's on LV II).

Thanks,

Dear Turbine Torture Club Members:

The purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference
call
this Wednesday, November 29 at 130 CT.  The following items have been
suggested for the agenda:

Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used
for
LM's and Frames, if possible.
Assignment language - new language being tortured within the Enron
ranks,
to GE soon.
Limit of liability, indemnity, etc. - Enron owes GE a position on this.

In addition, it seems to me that the following equipment will be
"moving"
soon:

City of Austin LM's (to be assigned to ENA, then NEPCO)
LM's for the ESA project
PSCO, LV CoGen, the remaining LM's, Pastoria, Blue Dog (all to DevCo,
right?)

I suggest that we address any commercial, financial or legal issues
outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines.

There may be others who need to be involved in the call, and there may
be
additional issues.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Kay

I think this is the  most current version.

 <<Exhibits to Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - without notations.DOC>>

Attached is the latest version of the Exhibits to the GE Turbine
Agreement.
 - Exhibits to Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - without notations.DOC

Will do.

Kay

I think this looks great.  With the rep letter language, I would ship it to 
Barnas, Shoemaker and Swift.

Here's a somewhat refined version, with a reference to the financing reps.  
Do we want to be more specific?

Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its consent if 
the proposed assignee: (i) does not have a credit rating of [___] unless (a) 
the proposed assignee provides appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or 
other assurances of payment issued by an entity or person with a credit 
rating of [__], or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all liability 
under this Agreement until [appropriate milestone], or (c) is a party 
participating in or providing financing or financing structures, including, 
without limitation, structures related to leasing arrangements and project 
financing, including a special purpose vehicle receiving financing to develop 
and/or construct the project for which Purchaser or Agent purchased the 
Equipment, if Purchaser or Agent has provided reasonably satisfactory 
representations concerning the sufficiency of the financing arrangement, or 
(d) final payment (except for the retention amount) has been made to Seller;  
(ii) is a direct competitor of Seller in the turbine manufacturing business, 
(iii) is an adverse party to Seller in any material litigation, or (iv) if 
purchasing the Equipment, such assignee is not purchasing such Equipment (or 
rights thereto) as part of a transaction in which Purchaser, Agent or their 
Affiliates is providing related goods and/or services to such assignee.  

I just love the law....

That looks really good.  If they want, they can add in the more specific ones 
- ya think?

You're a draftin' fool.

Rose

The next step in the turbine challenge is getting a draft working for the ESA 
transaction. You will find the turbines referenced on the Excel chart as ESA- 
Brazil #6 and #2.  I am forwarding the serial numbers for those turbines.  
Please get a draft going on this one - we want to close on Monday.

Rob Taylor is working on this from the finance side.  He should be faxing you 
some language which needs to be included concerning an agency arrangement.  
He may also have the names of the assignee and the agent.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Jeff,

Ozzie Pagan's team is working on a project for VEPCO.  The power plant will 
be located in Edgecombe County, North Carolina. I've been told that getting 
gas for the plant is a significant issue due to local gas supply conditions.  
One alternative has been to buy gas from the City of Rocky Mount, which has a 
take or pay contract with the local supplier, and is not using all of their 
gas, especially in the summer.  

We have developed a preliminary draft of the LOI, which I am attaching for 
your review.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you to 
get your input, etc.  Of particular concern is that Rocky Mount wants ENA to 
deal exclusively with them during the term of the LOI (this isn't reflected 
in the draft).

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Eric,

I had a computer malfunction and lost your email.  Could you please resend it?

Thanks,

Kay

Opps.  When you wrote back earlier I thought you were responding to me and 
not Rose's email, so I made a couple of changes and sent it out to 
everyone.    

The Barnas affiliate language required an affiliate to own or operate the 
plant (not construct), and I was unclear on the time frame when that had to 
occur.  I'll explain what happened and apologize to him if he thinks we 
re-traded, and can back off of the changes.

The insanity continues here. 

Kay

I was pretty much Ok with Rose's changes but your thoughts are good too, 
although we spent a lot of time on the affiliate issue and I'm OK with an 
affiliate owning or consturcting the plant.  Please carry on in my absense.  
I've turned into a hostage and do not know when I may be permitted to return.

Please send a reminder out to Mike Barnas, Kent Shoemaker, Steve Swift, Rose 
Engeldorf,
Ben Jacoby, Scott Dieball, and Sheila, and once again include the 
instructions (yeah, I know).

thanks,

Hi John,

Karen Jones in Portland has been working on it for ENA.  I don't know the 
status.

Kay 

Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
the status of the project.

Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big 
picture status?

Hi Scott,

Do you want to get together a few minutes early tomorrow to discuss 
indemnity/LOL, etc?

Kay

Michael says that you and he will be putting up Christmas decorations this 
evening "straight away"  "before nightfall"  etc.  Of course, it is a good 
thing to do at night so long as it isn't raining.

I was thinking it would be fun to have a family outing this weekend instead 
of sitting around the house.  Maybe Moody Gardens?  That seems like a fun 
place to go. 

What do you think?

Ben noticed a mistake in the ABB contract - one I missed.  Enron's address 
was listed as 1400 Louisiana.  I could not figure out where that address came 
from, as it had been correct before.  I asked Kathy and she told me that she 
changed it from Smith to Louisiana because she thought that was the correct 
address.

Ok, now I'm scared.

Since you both asked the same question, I thought I would send an email.

The little I know about rail is that the railroads control the contracts.  
You do it their way.

There is a lot of language in the LM contract concerning shipment, risk of 
loss, insurance, delivery.  I haven't thought through it all, but these 
issues probably need to be considered.   It may be best to work through GE on 
a change order basis to have them handle the shipment and storage elsewhere.  
Otherwise, we run the risk of having a dispute with them later about any 
problems or damage.  

I will be talking to GE this afternoon if you want the topic to be discussed 
then.

Good luck!

I'll have to ask Neil for Michael's SS#.  I don't have it on me.

I know Neil's boss and his boss' boss will have parties.  I think one in on 
the 16th and the other on the 30th (stupid day for a party).  Are those good 
days for you? I just can't get interested in going to the Enron parties - too 
many people.  We could really stand some shopping time (bah humbug), also.

   When you have a chance, please send me Michael's Social Security
number.

   I'll be glad when you and Neil start going to some Christmas
parties.

Kay may be right about cargo like turbines, but I know in the coal business 
we heavily negotiated bulk commodity transportation agreements that governed 
our shipments, and it was not necessarily the railroad's way. However, for a 
one shot shipment, I think Kay is probably right, although we should have 
some leverage to get reasonable provisions re risk of loss, etc.

FIVE GREAT LESSONS:

1 -   Most Important Lesson - During my second month of nursing school, our 
professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed 
through the questions,until I read the last one: "What is the first name of 
the woman who cleans the school?" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had 
seen the cleaning woman several times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her 
50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last 
question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last 
question would count toward our quiz grade. "Absolutely," said the professor. 
"In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They 
deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say 
'hello'." "I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was 
Dorothy.

2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain. One night, at 11:30 PM, an 
older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway 
trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she 
desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next 
car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those 
conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance 
and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down 
his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's 
door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 
special note was attached. It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my
clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able 
to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God 
bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others." Sincerely, Mrs. Nat 
King  Cole.

3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve. In the days 
when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel 
coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of water in front of 
him.
"How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked. "Fifty cents," replied the 
waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the 
coins in it. "Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired. By 
now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied." The little boy again 
counted his coins.  "I'll have the plain ice cream," he said.  The waitress 
brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy 
finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came 
back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly 
beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies - You see, he 
couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a 
tip.

4 -  Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path. In ancient times, a 
King had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to 
see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest 
merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly 
blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about 
getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load 
of vegetables. Upon
approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move 
the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he 
finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he 
noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse 
contained many gold coins and a note from the king  indicating that the gold 
was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant 
learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an 
opportunity to improve our condition. 

5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts. Many years ago, when I 
worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz 
who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of 
recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who 
had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies 
needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her 
little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his 
blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a 
deep breath and saying, "Yes, I'll do it if it will save her." As the 
transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we 
all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale 
and his smile  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling 
voice, "Will I start to die right away?" Being young, the little boy had 
misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister 
all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and 
attitude, are everything.

This is from my daughter.

At the risk of sounding like a wimp, I may just go home after my hair 
apptment.  I don't feel up to snuff, and I think it is my sinuses (check the 
weather).  I can work from there just as well as I can from here, only in my 
jammys.

Kay

I think he needs meds, including Prozac or something like that.  He is flat 
out having an anxiety attack.

There's a front coming in, and I'm surprised my sinuses aren't bad.  You know 
since I got off the allergy shots, I've been feeling a whole lot better.  
I'll be interested to see what the CT scan looked like too.  

Dan called and said he had lost 4 pounds in 2 hours and was wigging out.  He 
was going to wait another 2 hours and then call the doctor.  He's driving 
himself crazy.  They need to give him some meds to calm him down.  I hope 
it's nothing serious.

I don't blame you for wanting to go home.  I know where to find you if I need 
you.  I'll put calls into voicemail, but I'm not going to tell anyone you are 
at home (unless you want me to).

He needs to stay away from the scales.

I think so too, but you can't convince him of that fact.  I'm calling him now.

He said he's ok, just hanging out, but is going to weigh again at 2pm.  He 
said he'd call me if he's lost more weight.

Poor Dan.  He is making himself miserable.  I'm glad he decided to go to the 
dinner.  I bet everyone there heard about all his physical issues.

He just called and now his weight is back up.  I told him I thought he was 
having anxiety.  He's going to the closing dinner tonight after all, so he 
should feel better being around all his buddies at Pappas Steak House.  Hell,

Wow, I didn't know I could control anything!  

Change order 2 was initialled by Dale and signed by Chris on November 2, re 
stack extensions.  I also have a hand marked up change order form from Ed 
Danhaus referring to brush power system stabilizers.  Is this what you are 
looking for?

The procedure has been that the project team/attorney prepares the draft of 
the change order (or has EECC do it), I give it a sanity check and arrange 
for signature from GE.

The issue now would be whether this change order should be processed in the 
next week, or be a change to the break out contract.  I do not believe the 
cost has been included in the payment schedule.

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss this.

Thanks,

orders, you apparently have control over  a change order for this project for

When? Dec 30 is one possible date. The Inn at Onion Creek sounds nice. Your
thoughts...

Maybe we should consider going someplace for a couple of days, sans kids.

I haven't done anything.  I'm just making suggestions.  

I've always thought it was my responsibility to let me supervisor know if I'm 
gone, not yours.

I'm not usually a Galveston person, but it might be worth considering in 
December.  Might be best with Michael, though, so we could go to Moody 
Gardens and the Strand.  What I don't like about Galveston is the water 
(duh).  The San Luis is set up for kids, and has a neat view.

Guess I have itchy feet.  I haven't be on the road in a couple of weeks!  All 
I see at the house is responsibility, and we never do anything anyway.

Any ideas?

Fuel cells kindle investor energy
By Beverly Goodman
Redherring.com, November 27, 2000 
Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even 
though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on 
the feverish. We know -- this probably sounds all too familiar. But this time 
we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations. We're 
talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear 
source of future revenue. We're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly 
efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity. 
And while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the 
pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at Red Herring expect 
that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time. Investors 
more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop 
reading here.
There's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they 
provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than 
traditional generating sources (see Trend No. 9: Energy, December 4). Most 
only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as 
by-products, both of which are reusable. Simply put, fuel cells consist of 
hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst. Typically, the fuel cell is 
heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity. Since nothing 
is burned, no pollutants are created. In time, proponents say, fuel cells 
will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that 
manufacture them.
During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices, 
fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment. 
Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in 
the last 12 months. That's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit 
they took in the spring. The Nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent 
since last November.
Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs. H Power (Nasdaq: 
HPOW), Millennium Cell (Nasdaq: MCEL), and Proton Energy Systems (Nasdaq: 
PRTN) all went public within the past few months. While those IPOs may seem 
to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole 
picture. "We're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before," says 
William Fogel, a power technology analyst for First Albany. "The deregulation 
in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is 
in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet-based 
economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an 
increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the 
combustion engine."
Admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so 
profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies. But investors have 
proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become 
mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations. (Still 
holding JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU)?) With early-stage fuel cell technology 
due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers 
within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing) 
curve.
CELL DIVISION
The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary, 
portable, residential, and automotive. Fuel cells will likely hit the large 
stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to 
David Redstone, editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter. 
"We're talking about unprecedented efficiency," he says, noting that fuel 
cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential 
energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out).
Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80 
percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent 
efficiency. The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell 
Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL) (FCE), which is poised to be the first to commercialize 
them in 2001. At first blush, FCE's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months 
and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50 
stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap. But using a variety of 
metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and 
discounted 2006 revenue, Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE 
undervalued by 40 percent. Using a projected market value of five times 
estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5 
percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124.
Portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are 
also expected to be commercialized soon. Ballard Power Systems (Nasdaq: BLDP
), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly 
all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel 
cell-powered generator to market in 2001. "They don't make promises they're 
not able to keep," says Christine Farkas, a senior specialist and director at 
Merrill Lynch. "They've never disappointed." Ballard has also made 
significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis, 
a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: 
DCX) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F).
Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004, 
and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265. Still, Ballard's 
involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms. Farkas to 
expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to 
approximately $2.2 billion in net income. Applying a multiple of 25 to those 
earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock 
price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices.
INDUSTRY REVOLUTION
Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion 
has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive 
sectors. Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. declared at the 2000 Detroit 
Auto Show, "Longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the 
internal combustion engine." Legislation such as California's mandate that by 
2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on 
alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance.
While not a pure-play on fuel cells, Impco Technologies is well positioned to 
see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel 
delivery, storage, and power electronics systems. Mr. Fogel expects Impco's 
products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5 
billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010. (Its much more down-to-earth P/S 
ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in 
Impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the 
alternative fuel industry.) "They're involved with almost every aspect of 
General Motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and 
implementation efforts," Mr. Fogel says.
Impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent 
off its March 6 high of $52. But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006 
earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, Mr. Fogel 
arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a 
conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel 
sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to 
return to its high in the coming 12 months.
Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will 
inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which 
ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a 
joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change 
course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a 
price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell 
powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now 
wants to develop a "grid parallel" system, which would work in tandem with 
the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq 
turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13 
to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate 
to get that stock back on track.

Just to let you know I am supposed to have the copies of the LM6K purchase 
agreement today and was planning to distribute them today.  I thought I'd 
deliver the Bank's original to Roseann along with a copy.

I'll send her an electronic copy also.

Here is the answer to the storage charge question. As you recall, the 
contract allows for us to request storage.

Mike advised the storage charge for the transformers would be:  $1,500 prep & 
$500/week for each transformer.

Hi Carolyn,

Here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and LLC:

1.  Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the 
transformer as well as the turbine?

2.  Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload 
responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the 
equipment, not just the sale.  I believe this should be a TEH responsibility.

3.  Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and 
commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a 
reference is fine).

4.  Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the 
confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement?  If fact, please review 
the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss 
same.

5.  Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here.  We should 
specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed 
by a credit worthy entity.  

6.  Timing of delivery of contract and funding -  in discussing this matter 
with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the 
obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility 
agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to 
fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing.

7.  Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to 
convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the 
nitty gritty of our financing structure.

I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of 
where we are headed.

Thanks,

Kay

As soon as I hit the "send" button I recalled another issue.  Enron does not 
want the LLC used for anything other than the 
acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.  Other development 
activities should be conducted in another entity, at least so long as Enron 
has an ownership interest.  I'm going to double check this, as it seems the 
LOI is fairly specific on this point.

For the next step...
Kay Mann
11/30/2000 01:54 PM
Hi Mike,

Here's a draft of the facility agreement for your review.  

Thanks,

Kay

PS I think I have a redline somewhere.  I'll check.

Gentlemen,

The ESA docs are being reviewed internally for financing and accounting 
issues.  Thanks for turning the docs in such a timely manner.

COA is on stand by, due to our need to focus on ESA and two new, identical 
contracts (remember, we have a lot of turbines!)

The next two up are the ones previously destined for CAL ISO - I believe 
units 17 & 18.  These units also have the dual fuel options included, so the 
base prices of each will be increased appropriately.  We will pay 75% of the 
price prior to signing the facility agreement, and the January payment will 
be increased by 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option.

The turbines will be assigned to two sister Delaware LLCS:  CA Energy 
Development I, LLC  and CA Energy Development II, LLC.  Use Ben Jacoby at 
1400 Smith, Houston, 77002 for notices and invoices for purposes of the draft.

We don't have any of the specifics on the site conditions, so we will have to 
work with generics.

We would like to have a draft yesterday, but seeing as that is impossible, 
please advise when you think it can be ready.

Thanks again and again,

Kay

This is for future reference.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and
joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)
where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex
on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements
and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and
IPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work,
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

I'm sending the stuff Carolyn did, and attaching the letter revised to 
specifically reference the January payment.  I suspect that Coral may request 
language like Carolyn's version, as it tracts the language in the LOI.

I can see if I can come up with a reason to go to New York if you want to go 
there.  I know New Orleans has deals that time of year.  There is also 
Guadalupe River Ranch, and some decent B & B's in Galveston.

They do not have anything for the 29-30th. She said there was something in
her reservation book she wanted to check out but it didn't look good. I
asked about other dates and she said nothing back to back. She will e-mail
me later today or Monday with more info. You mentioned New Orleans. How
about New York if we have to fly? We also talked about London after the
first of the year. The 30th is very close to the first...NM

My understanding is that the ABB equipment will most likely be used somewhere 
other than Calumet due to the noise issue.  It is possible that LM 6000's 
will be used on Calumet, resulting in a re-bid of the EPC contract.  However, 
none of this is etched in stone, and their are active discussions with 
Peoples about what to do.

I suspect this isn't much help. Paul probably has better information.

Team
The contractors have responded to our technical questions.  We need to review 
their response and provide additional input as required.  Meetings are 
scheduled with each beginning Monday July 10.  Based on the contractors  
response and any additional open items,  please provide input to me and Don 
Pacer by Thursday evening July 6 so we will be able to close all issues with 
the contractors at our meetings.  One of the open items would be the 
re-orientation of the GTG.   We should be ready to discuss this with the 
contractors.

Team,

I still need comments on the GE break out contract which was previously 
forwarded to Finance, Accounting and Tax. If anyone who didn't get it would 
like to get it, please let me know.  

Also, I am unclear as to whether the consent form we received earlier this 
week is the final version from Enron's standpoint.  Any information on that 
point would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay

fyi

Ok Team, we are in the last throws of documentation of financing documents!  
They will be done by noon.  If anyone has comments, they need to be in before 
that.  I also want to receive written confirmation from Accounting, Tax, ENA 
Legal, EGF Legal that they have signed off on the documents.   The only 
document left outstanding which the legal team is busily working on for 
completion [today hopefully?] is the EPC Contract.

Starting on Monday, the legal team needs to begin the closing due diligence 
process.  Given that we thought we had a great call with GE this week and got 
at least S&S's signoff on consent letter, we haven't heard from anyone.  This 
is UNACCEPTABLE since it puts not just TurboPark but all the deals relying on 
TurboPark in jeopardy!

I will arrange a meeting on Monday to walk through the closing checklist with 
the legal team to insure that everything can be completed by December 13th.

CLOSING WILL OCCUR ON DECEMBER 15TH!

Happy Holidays,
Lisa

Ben Jacoby has asked that I forward the attached drafts of the letter 
agreement and LLC agreement.  These forms relate to the "turbine only" LLC, 
but once we get the kinks worked out of this we can move forward with 
finishing the rest.

These documents are subject to Enron internal review, but in the interest of 
time we are getting this out for comment.

I think that him leaving word for Michele might be more palatable.

Hi again,

Have you been asked to prepare the promissory notes referenced in the letter 
agreement?  If not, please put this on the list.  Also, what else will need 
to be prepared to close this deal?

I haven't heard for Coral yet, so I don't know if they bought in on closing 
early next week yet.  Since funding is required they may balk.  As soon as I 
know something I will let you know.

Thanks again for your help,

Kay

Attached is a revised version of the consent to assignment.  This version is 
specific to the ESA deal, but I'm told that the TurboPark version can be 
expected to be close to the same.

Kent, I'm awaiting final Enron input on the facility agreement as well, and I 
will let you know as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kay
See attached.

Chris,

We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly 
without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for 
this equipment as of now.

Here's co#1:

Each of these units has one dual fuel option.

The master list of serial numbers is in this document:

We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial 
numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.

I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January 
payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or 
whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel 
option amount.

Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in 
a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at 
separate sites.

I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.

Thanks,

Kay

Michelle,

I would like to sign up if there's still room.

Thanks,

Kay

I will be happy to review change order #5, and present to GE for their review 
and approval.  First, it needs to be prepared by someone involved with the 
project, and Finance needs to be notified that additional funding will be 
required, if they don't know already.  As I mentioned in my email, there 
needs to be a definitive decision made as to whether the change order should 
be funded out of WestLB (prior to December 15) or will be funded through 
TurboPark.

I faxed change order #2 to Al so that he has the form.  If this will be 
funded through WestLB, the current contract value is $352,289,400.

Here is the electronic form:

Kay

Jeff G Slaughter@ECT
12/01/2000 03:08 PM
Kay,

Just wanted to let you know if Al has not already done so, the stacks we were 
referencing were for an additional 2 stacks for a total of 6, CO no 2, that 
we are aware of, is for only four.

 Please let us know if you need anything else to get the additional two 
stacks ordered.

Thanks for your support!

Jeff

Kay Mann@ENRON
11/30/2000 06:03 AM
Wow, I didn't know I could control anything!  

Change order 2 was initialled by Dale and signed by Chris on November 2, re 
stack extensions.  I also have a hand marked up change order form from Ed 
Danhaus referring to brush power system stabilizers.  Is this what you are 
looking for?

The procedure has been that the project team/attorney prepares the draft of 
the change order (or has EECC do it), I give it a sanity check and arrange 
for signature from GE.

The issue now would be whether this change order should be processed in the 
next week, or be a change to the break out contract.  I do not believe the 
cost has been included in the payment schedule.

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss this.

Thanks,

Kay

Alan Larsen@ECT
11/29/2000 06:41 PM
Kay--In forwarding to Jeff Slaughter, who is on the commercial team for the 
Fountain Valley (PSCo) project, your note regarding transportation of large 
equipment items, Jeff mentioned that in your role with regard to GE change 
orders, you apparently have control over  a change order for this project for 
2 additional stacks.  Jeff asked if I could use my good offices, such as they 
are, to ask you to provide a change order, I believe to the attention of Ed 
Dannhaus at EE&CC.  Thanks for your assistance.

I had another error message today.  The box was titled "cmd.exe", and the 
message was "directory name invalid".

My computer is working so far, just thought I would report this for future 
reference.

Have a good day,

Kay

It needs to also go through Lisa Bills and Ben Jacoby.

It really doesn't matter to me who handles GE signature.  I'd like to get a 
copy just to stay current.  Plus, it impacts the break out contract (payment 
schedule and scope).

Kay

If it's ready to be signed by us and GE, either Kay or I can get it Kent 
Shoemaker and Steve Swift for approval.  As a practical metter as long as we 
have the right number on the CO and it conforms to the form, you could 
probably handle it directly.  What are your thoughts Kay?

Absolutely.

Kay

   

Today's call has been rescheduled for 9:00 am tomorrow (Tuesday).  Will you 
be available?

Thanks,

Mitch

Please calendar.

Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  Today has been beyond frenetic.

I agree with your comment #1.  I expect they will ask us for a rep like the 
one in #2, but they still want to hear it from GE.

My comments as follows:

1. In item 1, we should reference Coral's purchase of 80% of the member 
interests, and potential purchase of the remaining 20% after the COD.

2. Shouldn't we be able to handle item 2 with an ENA rep?

I think the acknowledgement letter needs to be very narrow with respect to 
the sale of the 80% member interest to Coral, and potential purchase of the 
remaining 20%.. An acknowledgement from GE that the sale of the 80% and 
subsequent sale of the remining 20% comply with the assignment provisions 
should be sufficient.

Ben

Hi Rob,

We are considering assigning a couple of the LM's to an Enron LLC, then 
selling the equity.  I've taken a stab at the assignment & assumption 
agreement.  Is this ok?  Has WestLB signed of on this form yet?

This is the same transaction I called you about this am.  Any thoughts on the 
notice question?

Thanks,

Kay

Coral wants some comfort from GE.  This is their proposal.

      During the EPC discussions, today in Sao                      
      Paolo, someone from ESA commented on the attached article and 
      how it's our "new" future.  The discourse then degenerated    
      into how "complex" those types of contracts must, to which I  
      quickly pointed out that they were in fact quite complex.     
      It's like Rigby says, "EES -- we do better lightbulbs".       
                                                                    
      Who Says Exit Signs Aren't Exciting                           
                                                                    
                                                                    
      Enron Energy Services (EES) is undertaking a rapid expansion  
      into overhauling inefficient lighting systems for current and 
      future customers. This includes the replacement of            
      illuminated exit signs in commercial buildings -- 25,000 of   
      which EES recently procured for installation over the next    
      year. As part of this effort, EES teamed with Global          
      Strategic Sourcing and DealBench to create a 45 percent       
      savings over the old procurement process. In a highly         
      successful collaboration, EES provided the technical          
      specifications and market pricing information, GSS provided   
      the deal expertise, and DealBench provided the technology.    
                                                                    
                                                                    
      These illuminated exit signs, which will be used in the new   
      Enron building and in commercial buildings of our customers,  
      are big energy savers. Whereas exit signs typically use 40    
      watts, the new signs use 4 watts. In addition, typical exit   
      signs use fluorescent or incandescent lamps. The new exit     
      signs use light emitting diodes (LEDs) and will achieve a 60  
      to 90 percent savings in electrical consumption. But it       
      doesn't stop there. The internal lamps that illuminate the    
      exit signs typically need to be replaced every six months to  
      a year. The LED-illuminated exit signs, however, only require 
      replacement every eleven years.

payable to ENA;
 2. Membership Certificate No. 1 (100% in the name of ENA);

We have not drafted the form of the promissory note to be executed by the

The word is that giving the notice could put the equipment on the balance 
sheet.  If the Coral deal didn't close, the equipment would be tainted.  
Therefore, the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that 
the Coral transaction will close.

The assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by Rob Taylor, and 
he thinks the agreement is fine.

Kay,

I will be out of the office for the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).  
We are in the process of getting the DASH signed -- Rebecca Walker will be 
pursuing signatures tomorrow.

The other outstanding issues are the Option Notice, the Assignment Agreement 
and an agreement with Coral. Have we received an update regarding the Option 
Notice from Rob Taylor?  

Rebecca needs to know when to send the wire transfer by 2:00 PM on the day 
before any funds need to be sent.  In addition, we do need to give WLB at 
least two days notice of any wire transfer (formally 5 days, but Rose 
Engeldorff indicated that we should be OK with 2 days).

 If you have any questions, you may contact me at 713-516-5409 for the next 
two days.  I will be back in the office on Thursday.

Best regards,
Raimund D. Grube

Hi Kathy,

I neglected to keep a hard copy.  Please send hard copies of the change order 
to:  Brian Hulse, Carl Tricoli, and me.  If you prefer, you can just fax it 
back, and I will send it to the ENA folks.

Thanks,

Kay

 Allyson called Friday afternoon to tell me they would be sending this out 
Friday, and it needed to be reviewed quickly.  It never came.  I left a 
message Friday afternoon, asking where it was.  They sent it to me on 
Saturday. I left out the really bad part.  I had to leave early on Friday 
because Michael's sitter (who picks him up from school everyday) had a heart 
attack.  She's still in St. Luke's.

I'll take a look at it.

Hi Guys,

In a conversation with GE today, they indicated that they thought it would be 
appropriate to insert the performance values in the text of the document, and 
do away with the exhibit.  Frankly, I like that approach also.  Could you 
please make that revision and resend the document?

The security desk downstairs may know who he checked in to see.

I know who can sign for EEPC and NEPCO.  I tried looking up LJM2-Turbine and 
haven't located it.  I'll try to track it down.  I previously sent the letter 
to the lawyers I believed to be responsible for the entities, so they have 
some background.

Kay and I had a conference with them this morning.  They had no problem with 
putting Brownsville in the mix; after they see our written changes, they'll 
confirm, but in general, it shouldn't be a problem.  That is, the provisions 
for Wheatland and Gleason regarding contract and warranty would now state 
"Wheatland, Gleason, and Brownsville".  Kay's redrafting the memo based on 
our discussion.

We'll forward it on to them once completed (this afternoon?).  Both parties 
expect to have it wrapped up by Thursday.

Kay, anything to add?  The only fly in the ointment I see is their desire to 
have all parties sign (NEPCO, EEPC, and LJM2 - Turbine).  Kay, I don't know 
who the right POA is to sign for these entities.  Will you be able to find 
out for a wrap up by Thursday?

Mitch

Where do we stand on the Westinghouse settlement letter?  Have you been able 
to incorporate something about the warranty issues (for Brownsville) into 
your discussions.  Please advise.

Am I begging too much?

Can you mail her package tomorrow?  I meant to ask today, but I got home so 
late I didn't get things together.  I put one of Michael's airplane pictures 
in there.

If all else fails we can take Michael to Fort Worth.  My mom would love to

grade of  bean dip).

I'm very excited!!!!

Hi,

You must be busy these days.  I remember this time of year - and I don't 
really miss it.  Cleaning and exercising were my favorite procrastination 
activities.

Neil and I would like to schedule a brief Neil and Kay vacation over the 
holidays.  We are looking at December 27-30, so we would be back before New 
Year's Eve.  We will pay you handsomely (in cash!!!) for keeping Michael for 
those days/nights.  What do you think?  We have found a room at the Inn Above 
Onion Creek.  I know Michael would be so excited to spend the time with you. 
We can give you guys a generous allowance to make things easier, and you can 
drive the Lexus.

Do I sound like I'm begging yet?  I'm working really hard these days, and a 
few days of no responsibilities sounds GREAT.  

You should start watching your box at the end of the week.  Hope it gets 
there before Saturday, since I know the SU post office is closed.

Mom,

I would really not mind taking care of Michael at all. The only glitch is
that I have that wedding to go to on the 28th. If you could find someone
(Lena or Charlotte) to take care of him then, it would all be fine. Also,
you were getting me tickets for the GalleryFurniture.com bowl, but you can
give them to someone else if you want. As long as I'm free for New Year's
Eve, then that's totally cool. If you can't find anyone, I can ask one of
my friends that isn't going to the wedding. I have got to start studying--I
have a test on Thursday, and I am booked solid with DDD stuff until then.
Oh. I just got back from business law. That's the one with the professor
who thinks I'm his best friend. He brought up this situation so we could
talk about liability of the company. A man who works at Love's (the gas
station) was doing a security check because he could tell something was
fishy outside. He went out, and the car was running off without paying for
their gas. Company policy is not to chase them, but to get their license
plate. He was a few steps outside the door, and the car swerved to hit him
and severely injured him. His skull is fractured, and 1/3 of his brain is
bleeding. He has four kids (7,6,2, and 1). So we were talking about the
liability of Love's. The family had next do nothing, and insurance won't
cover it. We discussed it for about fifteen minutes, and several of us said
Love's should be liable. Then he picked up his things and said, "I guess
I'll tell you. That man was my son-in-law, and those kids are my
grandkids." Yikes. The room was silent. I think I'm going to get him a card
or something. He looked awful. Anyway, that's the class I just got back
from. Let me know the details of your vacation so I can be jealous!:) 

Love,

Paige

Well I say book all three nights if the cancellation policy is ok, and let's 
go for it.  Jack to the doggie spa, Michael with Paige.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, the 26, 27 and 28.

Which nights do they have?

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

Not at all!
I forgot to ask you about The Box this morning when we talked on the phone.
I will make sure it's put together tonight, but not sealed if there are any
last minute items that come to mind, and take it to the post office
tomorrow
morning. I will call and make reservations after checking the cancellation
policy. What days do you want, or should we wait to hear back from Paige?

Am I begging too much?

This is all I've received on this today.
Attached is a revised draft of the acknowledgement letter which Tejas
would require from GE as a condition to closing.  The letter has been
revised to incorporate the substance of the changes which Don and I
discussed with Ben Jacoby this morning.  Additional changes to the
letter may be needed after Coral has seen and reviewed the Facility
Agreement.

The only ABB change order I know about is the one that cancelled two 
transformers.  It has been signed by ABB  but not Enron, but it is agreed.  
It resulted in a cancellation charge of around $350,000, and obviously 
lowered the contract value.  I'll get a copy and send it to you.

Kay

   

From the below, it does appear that for the PSCo project they want to make a 
change order to the ABB transformers.  I have a call into Ben Jacoby to 
discuss paying in full vs obtaining consents.

Regards, L
	Enron Global Finance
	

Per our phone conversation, here is the latest copy I've seen of Change Order 
#1 to the ABB transformer contract.  Your document should be drafted as 
Change Order #2 and any additional costs should be added to the contract 
total of $7,503,600.00, as amended by Change Order #1.  I'm assuming you'll 
have one of the attorneys on the Fountain Valley project (Al Larsen?) look 
over the language and confirm that the first change order has been executed.

I've taken a stab at revising the consent agreement to reflect the following 
changes:

Adding a material adverse effect clause - Lisa/Rose, I paraphrased on this.  
Making the consent effective the later or signing or financing.

I have ZERO pride in authorship.  This is based on ESA, but I would think 
would apply to TP as well.

I think we should get this to GE no later than 1000 am tomorrow if at all 
possible.

Kay

Hi there.

Could you send me the Word final of the master GE contract which was the 
basis for the subsequent facility agreements?  I don't have it in Word- just 
WordPerfect.

Thanks,

Kay

Mike hasn't sent the new assignment language. To my knowledge we had not 
discussed including it in this set of agreements, so he may have put it aside 
to work on the consent issues.  

Kay

See attached for our changes.  I am typing the Annex IV stuff now  - it has 
to do with Sections 26.4 and 26.5 - resolution of certain Purchaser-Agent 
Disputes.  We also will need to put in the currently-being-negotiated 
assignment language, so the bank knows that they have access to their 
collateral.

Barnas said he was drafting that after the last version Kay drafted.  I have 
not seen it yet.

Rose

Good morning,

We have made some revisions to the consent agreement.  I did not redline the 
changes since we were looking at  two different documents yesterday.

We added language concerning material adverse event and the need for the 
financing to occur before the consent is effective.  We could not include 
Paul's request concerning compelling the Owner to take action.

Please call me (713 345 7566) or Rose (713 345 7726) with questions, or we 
can address it in our 130 CST phone call.

Thanks,

Kay

I've roughed out a document for you to discuss.  It isn't in good enough 
shape to go to Peoples yet, but hopefully it gives you something to discuss 
internally so we can decide what we want to do. In the meanwhile, I'm going 
to continue to think through the issues.

Please let me know what I can do to help.

Kay

Thanks Peter.  I'm actually looking for the Master Agreement, not the initial 
facility agreement.  I know that Paul (or someone) had converted the original 
master agreement from WordPerfect to Word.  I thought it would be handy to 
have the file.

Thanks,

Kay

2.  I believe SWPC further agreed that the assignment to the LLCs (and the 
subsequent transfer of equity) will not affect the terms of the contracts, 
including the warranties.

   

Don -

Please forward on to Allegheny.

In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the 
turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation 
capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens 
Westinghouse Power Corp ("SWPC") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland 
facilities in the following way.

1.  Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines 
from 182mw to 185mw.  Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units 
to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the 
control curves accordingly.  SWPC further will agree that operation of the 
Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating 
parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate 
the warranty.  SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we 
give them authorization.

2.  SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments 
will not be unreasonably withheld.  SWPC will honor warranty claims currently 
outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such 
assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and 
Wheatland contracts.

3.  SWPC agrees to assist Enron in providing technical information, including 
redacted copies of the purchase contracts, applicable technical bulletins, 
etc. to Allegheny.  This information will be limited to information which is 
currently available to Enron and of a technical nature only.

I believe all of these features are significantly beneficial to Allegheny.  
Please ask Allegheny for feedback, as we will be entering into the agreement 
by the end of the week.

Regards,

Mitch Robinson

Thanks once again.  I really appreciate your responsiveness. 

In a recent email you mentioned that you had a couple more  changes to the 
ESA agreement, then we would be good to go.  Can I get that by the end of the 
day?

Many thanks!

Kay

You might want to check the payment terms.  Remember this is only for one 
unit.
Kay,
   Attached are the latest versions of the CA Energy Development
breakout agreements.  Please note that, because the agreements deal with
only one Unit each, the term "Unit Liability Amount" has been replaced
with "Maximum Liability Amount."  Also, there is no need for an Exhbit
N-1, so that reference has been deleted as well.  The agreement is still
missing an Agreement Reference number, Ben Jacoby's fax number, and the
information needed for the exhibits.  Thanks, Chris

I want to verify that the relationship between VEPCO and NCP is sufficient to 
justify the statement that we are negotiating a Power Purchase Agreement with 
North Carolina.

As for the statement concerning ENA owning the other peaking projects, I 
could verify the correct Enron entities involved given a little time.  
Perhaps we could work around it by saying that "ENA and its affiliates" are 
involved in these other projects.

I'll try to confirm the correct entity to apply.

Sounds good to me.  I don't see why the buyer would need the redacted 
information, other than curiosity.

   

Presumably this will work?  Additionally, we should be able to apply this 
same model to Brownsville, though they didn't mention it.

Thoughts?

This E-mail is a follow-up to our telephone discussion today. With regard to
providing copies of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts to Allegheny,
Siemens Westinghouse proposes the following:

1.  Siemens Westinghouse will prepare and forward to Enron electronically
our standard confidentiality agreement addressed to Allegheny.

2.  Once the confidentiality agreement has been executed, Siemens
Westinghouse will forward the PDP files (we believe that these agreements
are executed) to Enron.  We will redact the pricing information and the
liquidated damages provisions. If the agreements are not signed, we will
provide the signature pages under separate cover.

If this is not satisfactory, please let me know.

Kathleen:

The reason for acquiring this option is that Ms. Nordstrom's property is 
approximately 1000 feet from the eastern boundary of the project site.  At 
this distance, the home represents a potential sound receptor for ENA's 
Kendall County development project.  Of course, this is information that 
should not be communicated to non-Enron personnel.

Here are the terms which I would like to incorporate into the first draft of 
the Option Purchase Agreement between Ms. Ann Nordstrom (Optionee) and 
Kendall New Century Development Company, L.L.C. (Optionor):

1.  I would like to use the Fehr Agreement as a template for the Nordstrom 
Agreement (including the "Triggering event" language)
2.  The term of the Option should be for 12 months, with language providing 
for 4 subsequent 12 month extensions.  Each extension would require an 
extension payment to Optionee  (Let's leave this blank - I expect this to be 
the same or close to the up-front option premium amount)
3.  I would like to leave the option premium blank (I expect it to be in the 
$15-25K range)
4.  I would like to leave the purchase price blank (I expect it to be in the 
$200K - $250K range)
5.  I would like to include language that ensures that the Optionee 
(Nordstrom) has the ability to sell the property during the option term (or 
subsequent extensions thereof), provided that Optionor's right to purchase 
transfers with the property to the new Owner (Please confirm the legal 
feasibility of this requirement with me ASAP)
6.  The physical address of the property (approximately 2.3 acres) and home 
is:
 2013 Beecher Road
 Plano, Illinois
 60545
7.  One issue that I am concerned about is maintaining confidentiality of the 
option terms with potential buyers of the Nordstrom property.  Let's discuss 
this issue in greater detail.

As you are aware, Ms. Nordstrom's husband recently passed away after a 
lengthy illness and she is in an emotionally anxious state of mind.  She has 
placed her property and home on the market for $220K  and she is planning to 
close on a new home during the month of December.  My goal is to secure an 
option on her property prior to her selling the home to a non-cooperative 
Buyer.  We need to make sure we exercise the necessary sensitivity and 
respect while dealing with Ms. Nordstrom.

Let me know on the timing of preparing this draft.  I would like to forward 
the draft to Ms. Nordstrom's attorney by Friday of this week.

Thanks,
Fred

Hi Mike,

Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to 
transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by 
the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.  I would have sent 
this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.

Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to 
get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them 
contractually allocated to various projects.  Please give me a call or have 
Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.

the: (iii) u.s. port of export by any means of transport.
section 3.2.3 - Seller shall perform customs clearance for the Equipment 
through u.s. customs and pay any import duties.
section 10.2.1 Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date - Seller will cause the CT-Unit 
(author's note - includes the generator) to be delivered in an undamaged 
condition in accordance with the Specification-CT to the Delivery Point (DDP) 
in accordance with Schedule I below (the Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date).  
(author's note - the date specified in the contract was later slipped per 
agreement with enron).
section 10.2.3 Completion of Delivery - delivery of the CT-Unit to the 
Delivery Point shall be considered complete for the purposes of Delivery 
Liquidated Damages as it pertains to the delivery of Major Components 
(author's note - includes the GT and generator) when the last Major Component 
of such CT-Unit is delivered DDP to the Delivery Point in complete and 
undamaged condition.  ...  Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the 
Equipment for condition of the Equipment upon actual delivery.  Purchaser 
reserves the right to reject damaged Equipment at any location; however, in 
the event a portion of the Equipment is damaged or defective upon delivery to 
the Delivery Point, Purchaser after making an initial assessment of the 
damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect 
the installation , operation, performance, reliability, efficiency, and 
warranty of the damaged Equipment may either:
(i) reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the 
preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept 
delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred, 
or
(ii) after taking into account such criteria and Seller's proposed plan for 
correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section 9.5, declare that 
delivery has occurred: in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or 
defect, it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical.

c) facts of the case, as we know them:

common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of 
houston approx. 14jul00.  i.e., that was the ship's estimated time of arrival 
(eta).
westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about 23jul00.
enron representative (frank cervenka) went to CTSS (i.e., the westinghouse 
facility here in houston) on friday, 21jul00 to inspect the combustion 
turbine.  during that inspection, westinghouse employees informed him that 
the generator had salt water damage at the port.  as a result, the following 
monday, 24jul00, he visited the port of houston with the siemens-westinghouse 
insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator.  note - this was just a 
cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged.  the full 
extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time - 
e.g., repair or replace were still viable options.
enron received formal notification (faxed letter) of the damaged generator on 
approx. 18aug00.
enron has already made progress payments to siemens-westinghouse in the 
amount of 95% of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator.
DDP, per incoterms 1990, means delivered duty paid.
Westinghouse, despite 2 prior requests from enron, has not provided copies of 
the customs clearance documentation.  i.e., we don't know the exact date that 
the generator cleared customs, or if it cleared customs.
title means ownership, but does not imply either risk of loss or care, 
custody, and control.  with title comes both ownership and the responsibility 
for payment of taxes.

d) info not known by enron:

when did ship come into port?
when did damage to generator occur?
when, or if, u.s. customs duties were paid?

f) info known by enron:

generator is a total loss, as determined by westinghouse.
per section 10.2.3 of contract, enron was not given the formal opportunity to 
inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port.  as 
recalled by matt tezyk, westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing 
that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred.  
(author's note - matt to find cc of that letter).

g) enron's assertions are that:

DDP was not satisfied.  i.e., delivery of the generator did not occur in 
accordance with the terms of the contract.
title (i.e., ownership) remains with siemens-westinghouse.
risk of loss remains with siemens-westinghouse.

a) just received cc of letter from westinghouse.  in it, they assert that:

"title to the existing generator passed to enron upon delivery into the 
united states.  delivery occurred at houston on or about 23jul00.  as 
required by the contract and incoterms 1990, risk of loss to the generator 
passed to enron when the generator arrived (ddp) at houston while the 
generator remained on board the common carrier.  the generator was delivered 
in an undamaged condition.  title and risk of loss passed to enron before the 
water damage to the generator occurred."

Purchaser immediately upon entry into the united states.

Hi Mitch,

Here's a darft of the revised letter.  Please let me know what you think.

Kay

Gentlemen,

I'm attaching what we are calling an override letter to accompany the 
breakout contracts.  This letter is intended to preserve the lender 
requirements/accounting treatment from the WestLB agreement so long as the 
equipment is a part of the financing package.

I believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment, but we are 
still discussing Mike's version internally.

Kent, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow at 300 CST.  If you would 
like to discuss any of this in the am, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Hi Mark,

kill this year. If you want more than one deer your welcome to it. 6 is way
more than we can eat. Unless we skip breast feeding and start the baby on

How do you want it processed?  1 or 2 deer?

Lisa:

Ken Raber (electricities) and I discussed the option agreement yesterday and 
came to the conclusion that any issues electricities has with the option 
agreement will go to you directly.  I believe that will streamline the 
process.

The attorney's name is Mike Colo and his telephone number is 252-972-7105.

I would really like to get this option agreement signed as soon as we can and 
I'm sure you feel the same!

If there is anything I can do let me know.

Jeffrey

The Associate and Analyst Programs are conducting a combined Associate and 
Analyst Super Saturday this Saturday morning, December 9th.  We expect in 
excess of 100 candidates.  The interviews will begin at 9:00 a.m. and will 
conclude at 12:15 p.m.  Your participation is essential to the success of our 
Programs.  Please advise me ASAP as to the availability of your office for 
the use of these interviews.     Thank you!

Hi Al,

My suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #1 for 
PSCO's break out contract.  If it needs to be paid before year end (which it 
probably does) you can put a payment date of December 20th, and it will be 
paid out of TurboPark.  This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at 
GE, and he is fine with it.

Thanks,

Kay

Call me when you can.

Doug -

Pursuant to our discussions, attached is a copy of the revised letter for 
Peoples.  I have modified it to fit the current proposal and added some 
language believed to be necessary at this time.  You will also note that 
there is language indicating an assignment of this receivable to 
CommodityLogic.  There will need to be a document between ENA and CL to 
reflect this on an internal basis.  I will work on something later today so 
that we can properly document this matter.

Please look over the attached and let me know your comments.  I have copies 
Kay since she was responsible for reviewing the first letter and welcome her 
comments also.

Heather Kroll@ECT
12/05/2000 02:56 PM
Kay and Reagan,

We have an opportunity (VERY, VERY preliminary) to supply full requirements 
to a co-op that is breaking away from Old Dominion Electric Cooperative 
(ODEC) that is located in VEPCO's territory.  They have about 500 MW peak 
load and 200 MW of resources, everything else is covered by VEPCO.

If we got back our queue spot, we could build our peaker (within VEPCO's 
territory) to meet this load.

Kay, what is your opinion on the strength of our argument with VEPCO?  We may 
have a new deal that makes building the peaker viable again and so we may 
want to push them on it.

Doctor, do we have a pulse?  It may be the death of me, but we're going to 
build that peaker!

Heather
Reagan Rorschach@ENRON
12/01/2000 02:39 PM
Kay,

As we evaluate the viability of pushing VEPCO for reinstatement of our queue 
spot, a legal interpretation and opinion is needed.  VEPCO Capacity 
Acquisition withdrew us from the queue once the PPA negotiations were 
terminated eventhough we had a written agreement to do the interconnect 
study.  We want the queue spot back and are evaluating how hard to push.  As 
soon as we get it back, however, we will be pressed to specify equipment for 
the next phase of the interconnect study.

Keeping in mind that a "material change" would again jeopardize the queue 
position AND knowing that there is a high probability that the equipment 
configuration will change, the question is.......legally, how much room do we 
have under their tariff to make changes without being "material"?   In other 
words, if we change equipment configuration while keeping the MWs roughly the 
same (around 250 MW), is this a "material change" causing us to forfeit the 
queue anyway?

The web site ( http://www.dom.com/operations/elec-transmission/gi-main.html ) 
has the filings for interconnect procedures.  Can you give an opinion?

Thanks for your help,

Reagan

Doug -

Pursuant to our discussions, attached is a copy of the revised letter for 
Peoples.  I have modified it to fit the current proposal and added some 
language believed to be necessary at this time.  You will also note that 
there is language indicating an assignment of this receivable to 
CommodityLogic.  There will need to be a document between ENA and CL to 
reflect this on an internal basis.  I will work on something later today so 
that we can properly document this matter.

Please look over the attached and let me know your comments.  I have copies 
Kay since she was responsible for reviewing the first letter and welcome her 
comments also.

Hi,

I'm back.

I'll give you the short version.  I spoke with John, and he tells me he sent 
Mark and Vicky a  note saying that you  had paid your debt to society and are 
free to explore other options.  Pretty good stuff.  

I want to hear what M. Cash said, and who else you are meeting with.  Maybe I 
can lay some ground work.

Kay

Who is the labor lawyer that you guys use, and do they do plaintiff's work?  
I've had a couple of people ask me for referrals, and I don't know what to 
tell them.

Thanks,

Kay

here's one.
Kay,

Attached please find the letter to Republic National Bank.  I just got the 
original you sent me yesterday.

Best regards,

Thomas

That's a lot of money for music.  I wonder how they picked that as opposed to 
something else?  I'm betting on a Taylor Symphony Hall - that's building 
money.

Hi Scott,

I'm tied up in a call and I don't know when I'll be out.  Hopefully, things 
will lighten up soon.

Kay

Can we meet on this today?  We need to reach resolution on some issues.

Kay

I'm not that wild about the pan sausage.  Hamburger/italian/smoked are good.

Kay

Do you want alot of any one item, say hamburger? Maybe we can take two deer
and sell some of what we don't want. I have asked and some folks in my
office would like some. They would pay for processing. Are we going to split
a pig with John this year? NM

Neil,

You have my proxy.  Please let Anthony know what you think.

Thanks,

Kay

Anthony,

Venison would be tough to swallow without teeth.

ACastellese@Technip.Com on 12/07/2000 07:19:07 AM

Since I bought Bobbi a spot on the deer lease we have a total of 6 deer to
kill this year. If you want more than one deer your welcome to it. 6 is way
more than we can eat. Unless we skip breast feeding and start the baby on
deer meat.

How do you want it processed?  1 or 2 deer?

Please call me about this when you can.
The tax representation which should be included in Section 6(d) of the
Letter Agreement is as follows:

Since its formation, the LLC has not made any tax elections on behalf
of the LLC, including any tax election that causes the LLC to be treated
as anything other than a disregarded entity in accordance with Income
Tax Regulations section 301.7701-3(b).

I believe the payment schedule on the spread sheet previously given to AK is 
correct.  If there is a conflict, change order 4 takes precedence as to the 
timing of the payments.  At least 10% has been paid on these turbines, so I 
don't understand the 5% question.

Rebecca Walker is preparing an updated payment schedule for all the break out 
contracts. 

Kay

Dale Rasmussen@ECT
12/07/2000 01:51 PM
Pete Thompson called with a question about what payments have been made on 
the Las Vegas turbines.  He made specific reference to Change Order #4 and 
the effect it may have on the payment schedule for Las Vegas.

Do you know whether a 5% payment was made on these 4 turbines, or will the 
full payment amount be due on May 15, Julsy 30 and August 30?

Any info?
Kay and Ann:

Please advise of the names of the persons who will constitute the directors
of the new LLC (three appointed by Coral and one appointed by Enron).  Also,
please advise of the date (appearing in Sections 6.2(a) and (c) of the LLC
Agreement) after which the put and call may be exercised.  These items
appear to be the only outstanding information required to complete the LLC
Agreement.  Thanks.

Here is a version of a "letter agreement" we came up with (2 pages).

themselves.  I will double check with our legal/tax/finance folks [Bill, can
you comment on this?]

Kay,
I'm still in the office.  I assume you need the addresses of the parties
involved with the MOU to include in the "letter agreement".  (So the GE
entity named therein can send the money back to the Enron entity named
therein.)
I do not have access to that document at this time.  I can get access on
Monday.  If you have other names and addresses in mind, let me know.

Ok sports fans, here's a Blue Dog (who named this one?) override letter.

Ok, eagle eye, here's the override for your one train deal.

I'm about done.  How about you?

I left around midnight last night.  Not too bad if you don't have to do it 
often.  I need to deal with ABB today.  

Hope you are sleeping!

Kay

If you have one-train plus two-trains, do you have three trains?  Do you need 
a ticket to override?  Just kidding.  Hope you're done and gone for 
Yesterday!!!

Hi Ben,

I got  a call from Mike, and he gave me his lawyer's telephone number.  He is 
very interested in the change order, of couse.  Do I have the pay off number?

What would be a good time to talk about the ABB payment allocation with 
Herman?  I really want to put that issue to be, because I don't know if we 
can't put the stuff into TurboPark if we haven't taken care of it.

I'm getting GE consent to put the Coral turbines into TurboPark, if 
necessary. That doesn't mean we have to, but I don't want to take any chances.

How would you feel about not having the 1000 call and just having the noon 
call? That would give me time to talk to ABB, and we would be able to get the 
LLC agreement back to Coral.  

Thanks,

Kay

Good morning!

Thanks,

Today I'm going my GE's offices, so I'll be in late.

If the deals I'm working on permit (3 are supposed to close next week), I 
would like to take as much time as possible off the week of and after 
Christmas.  I won't take off all that time.

Thanks,

Kay

I'm out of the office until around 1000 cst, but I'll call.  In the 
meanwhile, please have the draft revised to reflect this payment arrangement.

This stuff is going fast and furious, and an executed ESA contract will be 
required for ESA closing their financing on the 13th.  That's why it is first 
in line.  We will need to start on a facility agreement for a project known 
as the Fountain Valley project (aka PSCO).  Also, I'm going to try to get ABB 
focused on doing their facility agreements.

I've asked the commercial team to prepare an update spread sheet for the 
turbines to confirm the payment terms.  I hope to have it this am.

What is your direct line?

Kay

Could you call me.  This is the first I've heard of the 25% of Change
Order 3 being added to the January payment.  That is NOT reflected in
the last draft that was sent out.  I had included all of Change Order 3
into the January payment.  The only deal that I was aware of where ENA
was doing the 75/25 split was the CA Energy Agreements. 

The first facility agreement which needs to be finished is the ESA
Facility
Agreement.  Peter and/or Chris, could you please send/re-send the most
recent version with a email stating any open issues, copying everyone on
this email.  We need to get this one ready to sign tomorrow, if at all
possible.

My understanding of the commercial deal is that the scope should include
change order #3, with 75% of the value of change order #3 payable on or
before Dec. 27, 2000, and 25% of change order #3 being added to the
January, 2000 payment.

Kent/Lee, sorry I didn't mention this in our phone call this afternoon.
That's what happens when I'm not working from my list.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Rebecca,

Is email from around 400 yesterday the final version of the payment schedule 
for the LM's?  I need to get the facility agreements organized, and that 
information is obviously important.

Thanks,

    Attached please find a clean and blackline of the latest draft of
the Enron South America Break-Out Agreement.  The only changes made to
this version is the addition of today's date and the 72/25 split of
Change Order 3 in Section 6.2.  We are still missing the Agreement
Reference in section 6.7.1.  We haven't made any changes to the exhibits
since the last time they were circulated.  I will pull them out of our
Houston database and circulate them shortly.

You may have told me the answer to this already, but is there a spreadsheet 
for the transformers similar to what we have for the turbines?

Thanks,

Kay

In regards to paying off ABB, I am trying to get a confirmed amount from Mike 
Sandridge to put in the change order.  I will hopefully be able to get that 
information to you this afternoon because we need to get the change order 
executed as soon as possible since a funding request must be issued to West 
LB no later than Monday at 10 AM since the last day that funds can be 
withdrawn from West LB is Tuesday.  If you have any questions about this, 
please get back to either myself or Ben.

This is the letter that Bob Long from Coral Energy sent me.  I asked him if 
Shell would be a guarantor for Coral's debts, but he said that, no, Shell 
does not guarantee the debts, but instead provides the liquidity that Coral 
Energy needs in order to pay them.

Rebecca
As discussed Coral Energy LLC is 100% (direct/indirect) owned subsidiary of
Shell Oil Company ("Shell").  As in the ordinary course of business Shell
provides liquidity support to its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Given the short term nature of this obligation we would hope that you concur
that there is little risk in accepting this Guaranty from Coral Energy LLC.

While we were on the phone I sent GE an email about the issue.

The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of the Facility Agreement should
be revised to read as follows:

"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below."

In retrospect, I apologize for not contacting Ms. Mann earlier (my former 
colleague who is responsible for this Tribasa mess) for she indeed did 
confront the issue that we are confronting.  Based on the attachment below 
and the other emails I am forwarding you, it appears that our procedure for 
accelerating EECC's payment rights will be to issue a letter to Republic Bank 
who will then issue a default letter to Tribasa and then based on that we can 
then issue a demand to AI.  If Ms. Mann so desires, she is welcome to 
participate in our 2:45 conference call, by rsvping through email.

here's one.

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Pontiac TSS.  
Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission 
Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of 
receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the 
ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the 
ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the 
latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they 
acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).

Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into 
TurboPark.  I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the 
following week. FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding 
agreement to see them the turbines.  If it would work to keep them in WestLB, 
that's great. However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of

Barbara and Peggy,

I understand that we may be looking for someone to provide some assistance on 
the Mexico transactions, and that Carlos Sole may be interviewing for the 
position.  Carlos and I worked together on multiple transactions in Mexico 
while I was with EECC.  In fact, I hired Carlos to work with me because 90% 
of what I was doing was in  Mexico, and Carlos has a good background in 
transactional work in Mexico. He assumed "first chair" responsibility for all 
the Mexico work when I left EECC. Carlos is bilingual in Spanish, and he 
conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably.  He is a very bright, a hard 
worker, and a lot of fun to work with.  I personally think he would be an 
excellent addition to our group.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information about Carlos.

do not know if we have all the documents listed. We need to either verify 
that we have these documents, or add some language about providing the ones 
in our possession.

Thanks,

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able 
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The 
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone 
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the 
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an 
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can 
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

David,

I believe you sent me some comments to the Fuel Cell equipment purchase 
contract.  I now cannot locate those comments.  Could you resend them?

Thanks,

Here's a good place to start.  I'm including a memo from Andrews & Kurth, our 
outside counsel who drafted the form.

Mitch,

The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during 
the conference call.  They requested something along the lines of what is in 
the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language:

SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to 
maintain an equity position in either of these companies.  SWPC further 
acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity 
will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.

How does this sound?

Kay

   

Kay -

No way.  My reading of the contract indicates that they can't withhold 
approval anyway.  Did they bring this up in Friday's conference call?

I left Bruce a message offering my assistance.

Bruce:

I'm unfamiliar with the documents you've requested (turbine/site 
guarantee).   I think you'll have a much faster turn around time if you 
contact Kay Mann.  Kay is our resident turbine expert, so you should benefit 
greatly from her assistance.

Thanks,
Ed

I hope so, too.

Thanks for sending this the Barbara and Peggy.  Hopefully it will result in 
Peggy's getting the relief she needs.

Barbara and Peggy,

I understand that we may be looking for someone to provide some assistance on 
the Mexico transactions, and that Carlos Sole may be interviewing for the 
position.  Carlos and I worked together on multiple transactions in Mexico 
while I was with EECC.  In fact, I hired Carlos to work with me because 90% 
of what I was doing was in  Mexico, and Carlos has a good background in 
transactional work in Mexico. He assumed "first chair" responsibility for all 
the Mexico work when I left EECC. Carlos is bilingual in Spanish, and he 
conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably.  He is a very bright, a hard 
worker, and a lot of fun to work with.  I personally think he would be an 
excellent addition to our group.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information about Carlos.

Lee Johnson and John Ayres are going to meet Monday morning at 8:30 to go

They should get back to you very quickly with any changes.  I think the

single unit.

Thanks,

He asked me for the comments.

   
	
	

Kay,
unfortunately I deleted the comments.  You may want to check with Scott Healy 
as I seem to recall that he may have been on the origination side.

This is really weird.  I do not know why I can't find your email with your 
comments (I really think I saw them), unless it blew itself up (or operator 
error on my part).  I will look for a hard copy.

Team,

I do not know if we have a full and complete set of documents, and if so, how 
long it will take to get these documents copied.  Ben, can you address that 
issue?  I don't want to assume that this is a slam dunk, as this is the kind 
of thing you can trip up on, especially since they are on a tight 
construction schedule.

I'm not sure I understand his second comment.

Kay
I have not received all TEH's comments, however, in the interest of time
I am passing along the following changes to all three (3) of the letter
agreements:

Section 3(g):  The addition of "in ENA's possession" should be deleted
from Section 3(g).  We were told that Exhibit T (or Exhibit B-2 in the
case of the ABB) was deleted from the Facility Agreement because the
documents had already been furnished to ENA.  If all these documents
have been furnished by GE (or ABB), then the addition of "in ENA's
possession" is not needed.  If all of these documents have not been
furnished by GE (or ABB), then the Facility Agreement should specify the
documents not yet furnished and bind GE to furnish those not yet
furnished, and in the letter agreement ENA should covenant to deliver
the specified documents which have been furnished.

Section 6(b):  Clause (iv) of Section 6(b) should be revised as
follows:

"(iv) following the date from the execution of the Facility Agreement
through the closing of the Transaction, neither ENA nor the LLC
will not have agreed to or issued agree to or issue any written election
or waiver with respect to the Facility Agreement as of the date of
closing."

The draft of the Facililty Agreement contemplates that the date of the
Facility Agreement and the date of execution are the same.

Hi Ben,

Have you talked to Janet about you being a director in the LLC's?  

Thanks,

Kay

Ben,

I suggest that we get EECC (or whoever) to put the stuff together.  You can't 
count on the right people being around after the 15th of December, and 10 
days is nothing.

It would seem to me that the retained amount on each transformer would be

Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2, this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire contract
document.

Regards,

Lee

Kay,

I edited the Termination Schedule replacing the term Purchase Amount per
unit to Unit Liability Amount for consistency with the new structure.

Lee

 <<Exhibits to Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - without notations.DOC>>

This is the most recent draft of the exhibits.

The following items need to be added to complete the exhibits:

1. Exhibits B-1 and H-2 need to be added.

2. If one is warranted, a Seller Parent Guarantee should be
included as Exhibit C-1.

3. Does Exhibit F need to be updated and revised before signing?

4. In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5. For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all
documents that it should have received by now.

Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic 
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless there 
is some reason to handle it otherwise.  

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do you

Kay, I had already requested that Michelle Cash set up an interview with 
Carlos; I had reviewed his resume and thought that he looked like a promising 
candidate.  I am glad to hear of your strong recommendation.  Thanks BNG

Michael is sick, so he's at home, and taking him to the doctor.  More strep.  
My baby had 103 temperature last night.  He was so pathetic.  I will probably 
stay home tomorrow.

You are difficult to keep up with!

If someone can tell me which ENA lawyer worked on it, I'll track it down.

David:  do you have the electronic file of the "MOU" for Cogen Tech.  If so, 
please provide to kay Mann per the request below.  I would be willing to bet 
that Mike Miller and ENA legal have the whole file.  We entered into the 
picture after the MOU was executed and only received hard copies.
 
Hi Brian,

Could you email me the MOU we are terminating?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,
Here is a version of a "letter agreement" we came up with (2 pages).
Perhaps we can use the same company ID's that we are using in the contracts
themselves.  I will double check with our legal/tax/finance folks [Bill, can
you comment on this?]
Regards,
Jeff Smith
  
 <<Termination MOU.doc>> 

Kay,
I'm still in the office.  I assume you need the addresses of the parties
involved with the MOU to include in the "letter agreement".  (So the GE
entity named therein can send the money back to the Enron entity named
therein.)
I do not have access to that document at this time.  I can get access on
Monday.  If you have other names and addresses in mind, let me know.
Regards,
Jeff Smith  

Hi Jeff,

I'm preparing the letter agreement regarding payment.  Can you help me with
the name and address to use?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I took a whack at redlining for CO#1 Fountain Valley Agreement.  You'll need
to do some touch-ups, I believe.

Let me know what other changes will be necessary.

Thanks,

Lee

Gentlemen,

Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since
we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process
this as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we
need the site specific stuff for this project.

Kay  - is there a contract in place between Turbo Park and GE or has the West 
LB contract and all of the change orders been assigned to GE?  If it has been 
assigned then the change order sequential numbers must remain in Place.  If 
you have a new contract in Place then the Change order could be number 0ne.  
Who is maintaining the change order log.  What do you mean by site specific 
stuff?  Who has a copy of the new contract?

Hi Sheila,

I'm not up on this part of the deal.

ckm
	
	

Kay

For ESA to exercise its LM 6000 purchase option, it must pay the Option 
Exercise Price of $101,249,431 (per section 3A of the Option Agreement) plus 
an additional charge of $21,500 per day for each day after November 22d (per 
section 3B of the Option Agreement).  If the option is exercised on December 
13th, the total amount to be paid would be:

Option Exercise Price      $101,249,431
Plus: Additional Costs: $21,500 per day x 21 days =     $        451,500
Option Exercise Price plus Additional Costs  $101,700,931

Please let me know if the execution date changes because this will also 
change the total dollar amount.

Thanks,
Rebecca

I plan to be there.

I didn't think about the champagne.  Nice touch.  I like Wick Fowler's - 
really easy, very tasty.  I just may have to have some.  I don't mind a few 
days of cold weather.  It kills the fleas and the skeeters.

If all else fails we will just make copies from the other agreement.

We have deleted Exhibit U from the break out contracts. In other words, the 
version they received has been superceded. I'll have to see what I can figure 
out about where the old reference came from.

Ben decided to send the exhibits to Coral, so that's where this question came 
from.

Will we have an exhibit U?

I know we owe you some answers from your email of the 6th.

Ben, Exhibit U indicates that liquid fuel guarantees are in Sec. 10.8.4.  I

Attached is a quick pass at a template for the Midwest Energy Hub Cash 
Management Policy based on conversations with both Peoples Energy and Enron 
personnel.  I have tried to get down on paper all the issues and have 
included several bracketed items and comments that need clarification.  
However, I have undoubtedly missed some things and welcome any input. If 
everyone could provide me with their comments by Thursday July 6th, I will 
incorporate them and work with Kay to translate this into an executable legal 
document.

Thanks for everyone's assistance,

Gregg

Hi Dave,

I revised the change order to segregate the signature page.  

Thanks,

Kay

I changed the 2nd paragraph so that ABB is receiving money, not paying it.

I corrected a typo under summary of charges (changed "by" to "to" Seller).

Kay

I thought we weren't going to have an exhibit U anyway, since we are plugging 
things into the text of the document.

I think the real point of the question is the reference to the liquid fuel 
guarantees, and where these will be reflected.

why does LM6000 contract still have brackets around the number of turbines to 
be assigned to WestLB?  Why does it still ignore the change orders rose asked 
you to include?

why does schedule v to PA still ignore the change orders to the various 
documents?

Please correct or advise why requests for changes are NOT being made.

As you know,  these documents are deliverables on Wednesday.  Blue Dog had 
comments from the other side today.  Why haven't I seen a revision or been 
asked if I agree with their comments?  

Please do not operate in a vacuum without consulting me or Roseon

I wasn't clear if the new B-1 is supposed to supplement or replace the old 
B-1.  It is up to you as to which specifications you think are pertinent.  
That gets a bit more technical than what I'm capable of judging.  You might 
want to give the old stuff the once over to make sure there isn't anything 
which in a worse case scenario you might miss having in there.

Kay

Kay you can use the spec (B-1) as sent by Lee to you yesterday.  It is very 
generic and the specifics of the Electrobolt project as far as performance, 
guarantees, gas quality, etc have been addressed elsewhere.

Suzanne,

On my desk (on the window side) you will find a bound volume of a contract 
for 24 turbine generator sets (between GE and a bank with a long name).  
Could you please fed ex it to Peter Thompson at A&K in DC.  Peter, could you 
please give Suzanne the information of where to send it.

Pete, this will give you a full set of exhibits, since you don't have 
everything.

If we need a copy Pete can send us a copy later.

The original GE West LB agreement, please.  

I suggest that you contact Lee Johnson via email, copying his lawyer Kent 
Shoemaker, asking for a proposed form of liquid fuel guarantee.  

Kay

I do not know what this guarantee looks like.  Liquid fuel is only
referenced in Section 10.8.4.  Do you want me to send a blackline of

Lisa is a real hoot. Smart, tough as nails.  She pulls no punches.  

Michael seems to feel better, but he has terrible circle under this eyes.  
I'm going to insist that the doctor give him 3 rounds of antibiotics.  Being 
a boy, it isn't so bad.  I just  know that the strep is hiding in his 
sinuses, so a week after he gets off the antibiotics he gets sick again.  

He slept until 800 today, and hour and a half later than usual.  I think that 
must be his body healing.

He is so excited that 6 flakes of snow might fall tonight.

Paige wrote me today, said she is freezing (she's north of Austin).

Kay Mann has requested that we run blacklines of the Enron South America
Agreement and Exhibits showing changes from the original GE/West LB
documents and to send them to her house.  Could you please run: (1) a
blackline showing changes from the original GE/West LB agreement
(Hou:554888.1) to the current version (Was:83164.6) and (2) a blackline
of the original exhibits (Hou:554886.1) to the current exhibits
(Hou:554886.6)?  Please have the blacklines delivered
to Kay's house at 29 Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055.  

Thanks for your help Lori.  If you have any questions, give me a shout.

In fairness to Pete, we have him working on ALL the GE and ABB break out 
agreements at once.

I'm going to be reviewing the ESA agreement, which is priority one because of 
financing requirements.  This will be my final review of the "form" break out 
contract.  We have not had a tax, insurance, accounting or finance review of 
the form for ENA, and with TurborPark closing this week it may be difficult 
to have completed within the next 24 hours.  However, I don't expect any big 
issues, since it is so close to the original form. That being said, from the 
EPC contractor's standpoint, it is so close to being done that there 
shouldn't be any big issues.

Just thought I'd mention all the pieces which are still coming together.

Kay

PS.  Dale, does the LV Co Gen project involve a lease (a/k/a Enron getting 
off take)?

h

I'll have it to you by the end of business.  I apologize for the delay,
my secretay and Chris Cobb have both been out the last two days.

Peter:  Our EPC contractor and our prospective investor need copies of
the
final LV Cogen breakout contract.

Please let me know of the status of the final changes and e-mail me a
final
copy as soon as possible.

Thanks

Dale  (503) 803-1700

Peter:  This should answer your questions for the final breakout.
Please
make the changes and forward.

For now, let's assume that the 240 TDI number is per machine.  We can
confirm with GE on Monday.

Thanks.

     3WTC0306
     121 SW Salmon Street
     Portland,  OR 97204

2.   Section 6.7.1  - The sentence should end with "this Agreement."  (
See
definitions)

3.   Section 6.7.2 - Address same as above.  Fax is 503-464-3740.  Attn:
Should be Jody Blackburn

4.  Information regarding notices in sections 25.1/25.3

     25.1 - again -      3WTC0306
                         121 SW Salmon Street
               Portland, OR   97204
               Attn:     Jody Blackburn
               Fax: 503-464-3740

     25.3      Same as above (25.1) except:
               Attn:     W. J. Williams Jr.

Comments regarding To Finalize the Exhibits...

1. Do you need anything in Section B of (Schedule) Exhibit A-17...Answer
is
no.  Reason: These gas turbines will not burn liquid fuel.  They do not
have the provision or physical means to do so as procured under this
contract.

2. Exhibit B-1 (Specification)....somewhat confusing as under West LB,
B-1
seemed near identical to Exhibit B.  The West LB original has
introductory
language that says the GTs are designed to operate ion simple cycle
mode....standard stuff I'm sure, but as this is a break out contract for
Las Vegas, our gas turbines will operate in combined cycle.  Not a big
deal, and it is true I'm sure the machines were designed and built to
operate in simple cycle.

I'd suggest you ask GE to confirm the West LB original spec under
Exhibit
B-1 is correct.  If yes, incorporate it.

Exhibit H-2 - Training... GE provided a Training tab and material during
the ODM September 19th, 2000 in Jacintoport.
It goes into a lot of detail, but could be incorporated therein.  Also,
Exhibit B-1 of the West LB addresses training.

Exhibit R - Witness Test Points...No feed back from me here. I have been
told GE no longer test fires their AEOD Gas Turbines prior to shipping
from
Cincinnati or once in the package at Jacintoport.  We would like to be
notified and witness as a minimum, test firings.  Eric or Chris Booth of
ENA may be able to suggest other points.

Exhibit T - My copy says Not Used.....

One last point.  I do not see 240 hours of TDI referenced in the Scope.
That is in the West LB contract.  It should be here as well.
Clarification.  Is it 240 hours per machine? Do we get the multiple? (X
4?).

Can you please advise me and Toni Bustamante in accounting when the ABB 
change order is signed?

Thanks,

Have I received a fax from ABB?  

I used to work at EECC, so I know that noone controls that group!

There is a place in the agreement for a contract number.  I think we ought to 
use the same contract number as before, but add a distinguishing number or 
letter- like FV or LVCG.  How does that sound?

Kay--I left you a voice mail apologizing for your being bombarded with 
general questions about the C.O.s for Fountain Valley.  My intention was that 
EE&CC would get the CO into final shape, and just pass it on to you at the 
point it was ready for GE signature.  I do have one question though, in light 
of Dale's note below:  how we want to identify the Fountain Valley breakout, 
as opposed to the previous GE master agreement.  Thanks.

The way the process works as I understand it, is this:

Last week we developed forms of breakout contracts for each of the turbine 
"groups" (1 for LV, 1 for Fountain Valley, etc.).

In order to accomplish changes to the individual breakout contracts 
reflecting changes to project-specific turbines, it was decided that rather 
than issue any additional change orders under the master (24 unit) contract, 
either (a) the individual breakout contracts would be modified prior to 
execution to reflect the changed information; or (b) change orders would be 
issued under the individual breakout contract.

I worked with the crew last week on the form of breakout contract for the LV 
turbines.  I haven't done any change orders under that contract.

As I interpret the attachment below, the required modification is to change 
the reference from CO#6 to the master contract to CO #1 to the Fountain 
Valley breakout contract.  Of course, I may be missing something here.

I did an earlier change order to the master contract that I could forward, if 
that would help.

Alan Larsen
12/11/2000 04:43 PM
Dale--I understand that you have done Ge change orders breaking out the LV 
Cogen equip.  Could you send me a copy of your breakout C.O.? Thanks.

Gentlemen,

Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since 
we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process this 
as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we need 
the site specific stuff for this project.  

Kay

michael.storm@ss.ps.ge.com on 12/11/2000 03:17:27 PM
All,

Attachment contains latest revision reflecting order for two additional
stacks, six power stabilizers and moving cost for the Fountain Valley
Project.  Please review and let me know if additional changes are required
or recommended.

Dave Onuscheck left me a voice mail message that Frank had not yet reviewed 
the change order. Dave predicted it would be tomorrow am.  That's getting 
close., but if it is done by then we probably won't be subjected to bodily 
harm. 

Kay

I'm home today (Michael has strep again), but I will check email and you can 
call me at home.  This is a good start!  Bear with AR, and call me about 
Barbara.  Sheila knows all she needs to know.

ckm

ps YIPPPEEE!!!!

Here's another draft:

Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement 
(exh. A), termination rights, term.  I also made a minor change to dispute 
resolution.  As for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets, these should be 
covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very 
basic (see underlined language).  I just want to make sure we get the gas 
supply contract ASAP. We can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that 
helps.  

I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner.  I'll get the interconnection 
agreement started on this end, unless you think otherwise.

Hope you are having a good trip.

Kay

We are getting the Enron treatment from Coral.  I hope Carolyn told you I 
called yesterday - Coral was looking for Shell approval.  I'm guessing it is 
in a coma.  I usually have 30 voice mails, and I have had 4 today, which 
tells you something.  Good  time for Michael to be sick!  

Carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ENA.  I think he is looking 
good for Mexico.  You guys are the absolutely best qualified for that 
business, and I'll start planting that seed when I can. 

By the way, thanks for the great job on Coral.  Did you hear from Rose on the 
HSR on TurboPark?  

We do want Astros tickets for next year - at least 15 games.  Are more 
available?

I heard that Hampton had an issue with Patty Biggio (thank goodness, these 
salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.  However, 
he is not a substitute for a pitcher.  And how is Shane?

Ciao,

Kay

Two of the deals I've been working on died. I've had almost NO voice mails 
today, and a third as many emails.  This is great.  Maybe Neil and  I will 
get to take our vacation after all!  

Kay

thanks-Carlos talked to me yesterday and is excited at the prospect of the
Mexican work.  

Rose hasn't called me yet-thanks for the intro.

More tickets are available-as many as you want (I think you're the only real
fan in the group).  Hadn't heard the Biggio story-I'll check into it and
pass any gossip.  I think Asmus will be a good addition, but we still need a
good starter.

I wasn't clear if the new B-1 is supposed to supplement or replace the old 
B-1.  It is up to you as to which specifications you think are pertinent.  
That gets a bit more technical than what I'm capable of judging.  You might 
want to give the old stuff the once over to make sure there isn't anything 
which in a worse case scenario you might miss having in there.

Kay

Kay you can use the spec (B-1) as sent by Lee to you yesterday.  It is very 
generic and the specifics of the Electrobolt project as far as performance, 
guarantees, gas quality, etc have been addressed elsewhere.

Hi Gregg,

Here is a new draft which incorporates comments that Boyd and I have made.  I 
haven't reviewed this version yet, but I wanted to get it to you asap. I 
would like to look at this draft before it goes to Peoples, and I'll give it 
priority for tomorrow am.

I spoke with Dave Gorde (RAC).  He is prepared to discuss line of credit/DASH 
at your convenience, although tomorrow he is tied up with PRC.

I'll go ahead and get a draft of a "simple" revolving line of credit doc 
started, unless you think otherwise.

conference call and can't break free.

I had a really big lunch, even cake, so now eating out of the fridge (if at 
all) sounds ok.  I got a really nice bottle of white wine from Andrews & 
Kurth.  I put it by the window to cool off. 

I've worked with three trial lawyers from K & S, and they are really good.  
However, K & S represents American Express.  Keffer tells me that you used a 
guy at Bracewell that you liked, and that this person has now started their 
own firm.  John drew a blank on the name, but will call me back with the name 
and number.  

Enron also likes Gibbs & Bruin, a litigation boutique in Houston. I believe 
the main contact's name is Robin Gibbs, but that is also the name of one of 
the Bee Gee's, so I could be wrong.  Can you check the internet and see?  If 
not, I will look in a minute.

Love,

Hi Sheila,

Did you ever come across the retention letter for PMRW reflecting a fee 
discount?  Who would have that?

Thanks,

Kay

These documents do not go to a third party purchaser.  For instance, they do 
not get the change orders or correspondence relating ot all of  the 
turbines.  What needs to be pulled together are the technical documents, and 
any project type correspondence relating to the units being sold.

Kay

   
	
	

Matt Tezyk in EE&CC would like the following information from us in order to 
help him prepare the documentation on Units 17 and 18 for a third party sale:

The free storage letter from GE
Any correspondence between GE and Ben or you relating to all 24 turbines
Any change orders in addition to #1-4
Documentation on any other deals we have made with GE in regards to the LM 
6000 turbines

Ben asked me to follow up on this with you since he does not have copies of 
the documents.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Very minor crisis.

A penny for your thoughts...

Kay

The end is in sight!

The break out contracts for the TurboPark LM's need to be finished up (not 
news to anyone).  Each of these agreements will be between GE and E-Next 
Generation LLC (DevCo) and GE, unless the project company is already owned by 
DevCo.  I suggest that each agreement reference be the same as the original, 
with an adder which makes it clear which project it belongs to (LVCG, FV, 
CISO1 and CISO2, for example).  

Al, your contract needs to be fixed up.  Please contact Pete Thompson at AK 
in DC to get it rolling, if you haven't all ready. 212 662 2780

Pete, the CA Development agreements should now be in the name of E-Next 
Generation LLC.  For indentification purposes we can call the contracts CISO1 
and CISO2. 

Thanks,

Kay

But I want you to be in the same group as me so we can work together again!

I forgot to write a check for the Astros tickets last night. Do you want to
write it and get it over to John?  Twenty games would be $2,377.20.

I have never seen the language requested before and have not signed off on

party to this Consent."

Nancy,

As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants Enron 
to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.  Please put this on 
your list.  I will check around here to see if there is a form we want to use 
as a starting point.

Thanks,

Kay

This is the language in front of GE. I am optimistic that they will agree to 
this language.

Kay
Winston & Strawn has asked that the following be added to the Consents
to Assignment (e.g., in the "Successors and Assigns" paragraph):

"WestLB is an express third-party beneficiary of this Consent."

Please forward the revised draft of the GE Consent to Winston & Strawn
(toxley@winston.com).

Hi Dave,

I received a signed change order from Randy Milcer (not sure about that) 
yesterday.  The form he signed indicates that ABB will be paying Enron, and 
has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled 
transformers ($400 off).  With your permission I will substitute the correct 
version so ABB gets the money.

Thanks,

Kay

Thought you might want to see it!

Kay

How's Hop-a-long?

Dick,

I'll forward you the copy of the contract on a separate email.  

I do not know if there are any additional insurance requirements specified by 
the lenders.

I just got off the phone with Rob Taylor with A-K.   He recommended I write 
to both of you as you two could provide the information requested below.  As 
closing is set for Tuesday, Lenders will want a certificate of insurance for 
these LM6000  turbines.  No Brazilian Elektrobolt project insurance is in 
place as it is not required at this time so we will try to issue certificates 
under the Enron Corp. program for these while they are still located in the 
States.  Once they are loaded on the vessel, the project specific cargo 
policy will go into effect.

 I need any insurance requirements in any contracts pertaining to these 
turbines.  I have seen none so far.  I will also need exact wording to put on 
the certificates of insurance with respects to  the names of all loss payees 
and are they named and waived.

As this is a short time frame, please answer the information below today if 
possible as I need it before I can proceed any further.  Depending on the 
data, hopefully we can utilize the Enron Corp. program in the interim.   If 
not, we will need to secure interim coverage and that could take some time.   
Also please send me any supporting data, such as insurance language, you have 
available.

I thought you were going to give them the EXHIBIT G's.  As I am handling this 
as three separate projects and you are dealing with it as one, I need to know 
exactly what you need.  Is it to evidence the property for the LM6000's?  I 
need the specifics then I can see what exactly they need.  Again, the Exhibit 
G's for all practical purposes will serve as summaries as no project coverage 
is in place.  I did write you earlier this week after the phone conference 
advising that if required to place interim coverage or access the Corp. 
program we would do so upon notification of the exact insurance requirements 
for same.

I need to know the  following.

Where are the LM6000's
How many are they?
What is their value, each?
Who has title?
Who has risk of loss?
In what contract are the insurance requirements?  
Can somebody forward me same?
How long will stored at their present location?
Where are they headed after that?

As I said in the phone conference, Project Insurance will not begin until 
they leave the States since the Project insurance will be issued in Brazil 
under Brazilian Insurance Regulations.  If coverage is needed here, I will 
secure same or access the Corp Program.  I need specifics.

Dick

CLiff & Dick,
We have just hung up with the equity to go over & decision alot of 
documentation issues they had.  One thing they will require by closing is 
something evidencing that they are co-insured under all insurance at 
closing.  They were most concerned about coverage for the LM 6000's.  Dick, 
they also asked where the summary of insurance you had promised on the phone 
with them on Monday was.  Could you let me know your time frame.  The sooner 
we get that to them, the better.  Thanks for all of your help!

Peter/Kay,

Attached is revised ESA Facility Agreement.  This includes the Optional
Electric Output Guarantee for the Brazil site conditions.  Since the spread
between the 8 unit average guarantee and the single unit is greater than in
the base contract the LD sample calc needed some work, which I took care of.

Kay/Kent,

I also took a swipe at the 17.4 Termination language rework. See if I what I
came up with works...if so, we can use on all other Facility Agreements.

I've added John Ayres to distribution.  John and I will be reviewing the
contract Monday AM at 8:30 in his office.  Kay, it would be good if you
could join us ...as we're in the home stretch.  Also, can you send Peter the
remaining Exhibits he requested (B-1 and H-2).

thanks,

Lee

    Attached please find a clean and blackline of the latest draft of
the Enron South America Break-Out Agreement.  The only changes made to
this version is the addition of today's date and the 72/25 split of
Change Order 3 in Section 6.2.  We are still missing the Agreement
Reference in section 6.7.1.  We haven't made any changes to the exhibits
since the last time they were circulated.  I will pull them out of our
Houston database and circulate them shortly.

Kay,

I had a copy of the last redline for Exhibit B-1.  Don't have execution
copy.

On Exhibit h-2, Training -- I'll look for it, but think Kathy had it last to
identify it as H-2.

Thanks,

Lee
Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless
there is some reason to handle it otherwise.

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do you
have more copies of that document that we can attach?

Kay

lee.johnson@ss.ps.ge.com on 12/11/2000 03:15:31 PM

Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2,
this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire
contract
document.

Regards,

Lee

Kay,

I edited the Termination Schedule replacing the term Purchase Amount per
unit to Unit Liability Amount for consistency with the new structure.

Lee

 <<Exhibits to Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - without notations.DOC>>

This is the most recent draft of the exhibits.

The following items need to be added to complete the exhibits:

1.   Exhibits B-1 and H-2 need to be added.

2.   If one is warranted, a Seller Parent Guarantee should be
included as Exhibit C-1.

3.   Does Exhibit F need to be updated and revised before signing?

4.   In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5.   For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all
documents that it should have received by now.

confirming today's calls, westinghouse is asking enron whether we'd consider 
the following settlement of the "north america peaker/panama/electrocities" 
gtg issue, particularly as it relates to the damaged generator (again, plz 
understand that this is not a formal offer at this time; will come within 
days depending on our response.  westinghouse does not want to go to their 
senior management with a "settlement" offer without knowing that enron will 
respond favorably when formally presented; i.e., just a waste of time for all 
concerned):

westinghouse will re-imburse enron asap with money's paid to date by enron to 
westinghouse.  note - westinghouse is willing to consider taking back the gtg 
for what enron paid westinghouse, BUT NO addl monies will be offerred or 
considered.  this is a "ceiling."
money to be wired within days of settlement agreement.
westinghouse takes back the unit "as-is."
no further claims/rights of action between the parties on this gtg/contract.
this potential of an offer from westinghouse has a life span of just a few 
days (i.e., this week).  westinghouse is "long" on D5A machines and for them 
to take this one back into the fold will present them with marketing 
challenges in 2001.

pros
brings cash back to enron on the balance sheet before end of year.
we don't currently have a use for this gtg in an enron project.  (i.e., 
unless an idc treatment can be agreed, project's now can't typically afford 
this unit).
we don't currently have an anticipated use for this gtg in the next 6 to 9 
months in an enron project.
we don't have to pay for storage; i.e., such costs are already accruing.
dispute resolution (per contract) consists of senior management meeting 
seeking to settle; if unable, the remedy is the n.y. courts.  therefore, we 
can avoid lawsuit.  therefore, we'll save on outside legal costs.
as part of settlement, we can possibly secure an option forward or first 
right of refussal on a "f" or "g" machine for projects in 2002.
by settling now, this avoids further month by month increases in idc.

cons
idc costs to be written off by ena (or elsewhere?).

for ben - plz advise.  dan shultz, kay mann (hopefully) and scott laidlaw are 
available to meet today on this issue.  regards.  scott.

Well, I've lost today somewhere along the way.  How about Friday morning?  
You and I can discuss the agency agreement, then get them on the line.  
Anytime is good for me.

Accounting, was also going to check on the necessity of a DASH so I would 
like to include her to the extent she is either available or interested.

Thanks,

Gregg

I've redlined the document against the previous version, but I don't think I 
picked up all the changes.  In addition to the marked changes, there are 
these changes:

D.  third line, added "Original" before LM6000.  This change is made 
throughout the document.
D. pentultimate line, replaced EECC with ENA.
Dated everything December 15; added "with respect to the Subject LM6000 
Turbines after "Original Turbine Contract" throughout
E.  Added "and" between rights obligations in (iii)
2 (c) Added the Pastoria One-Train Turbine Contract in (ii) and (iii).

Hi Jim,

I'm a lawyer in the Houston office, and I can give you a hand on the LM6000 
transaction.  My number is 713 345 7566.  Could you send me the full name of 
the buyer, and we'll get the documents moving.

Thanks,

Kay

I forgot about the happy hour.  Where is it?

I think that carpool could be pretty hectic, and since you and I haven't 
picked him up we don't know the drill.  Picking him up an  hour later might 
be a lot easier, and it doesn't bother him.

Are you going to any of tomorrow's activities?

Kay

Probably. I guess we need to tell Norris he will be picked up later. Do you
want me to send her an e-mail or wait until we talk to Paige?
Also, what about the baseball tickets? Remember this is the Vehicle Repair
Loss Control Happy Hour today at 3:30pm. I will go late and leave early as
I've told everyone I need to pick up Michael.   NM

It would probably be easier if Paige picked him up at the CC, don't you
think?

Kay

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

Michael's class party is tomorrow at 2:15 followed at 3:15 by the gym class
party.

Next Wednesday school is out at 11:30 and he should be picked up in the car
pool line. The Children's Center is open until 6pm that day if needed.

Thanks for taking care of me last night and this morning.

Love, Neil

I forgot to write a check for the Astros tickets last night. Do you want to
write it and get it over to John?  Twenty games would be $2,377.20.

NRG Thermal and Millenium Energy are the parties.  More specific names to 
come.

Next week is Twas the Night Before Christmas.

I spoke to Jon Stroble of El Paso today and he as agreed to delay signing this
agreement until next week.   We need to get him any comments by close of
business on Monday, July 17.    Can you please review and get me comments 
ASAP.
thanks and sorry for the short notice.
Cory,

Please see comments in attached file.  I changed the date to July 14th
assuming we can sign on this date.

 <<agree_6_13_00.doc>>    <<TsCs_6_28_00.doc>>      <<pricing_06_23_00.xls>>

I'm hoping you can rewrite these files incorporating these comments as well
as Shelly's comment below and Mike Neuman's comment from his 6/28 email
copied below.

Parent Guarantee-We feel the dollar amount for the parent guarantee should
be raised from $33Mill to $37mill to allow us some room in case of change
orders.  In any event, the Contract Price is approximately $35mill.

Thanks,
Jon

          As per my previous e-mail.

          -----Original Message-----
          Jon and I met with East Coast Power this morning to discuss
the contribution by El Paso of the GE Turbine for the Linden 7 Site.  The
assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the
assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word
affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a
49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate.  I
would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the
word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East
Coast Power L.L.C.).  Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like
to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue
when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El
Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an
ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the
presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this
with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP.  Finally, I
would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment,
we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP.

We have enclosed initial drafts of the following documents:

 1. Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
turbine letter agreement with Coral);

 2. Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean
copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of
the transformer letter agreement with Coral, and blacklined copy marked to
reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no. 1
above);

 3. Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
LLC agreement for CA/ED-II).

As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the
representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where
necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron.  The
justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such
representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that
appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what
is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it
wants.  Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the
representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be
eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty.  Because we
rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more
clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur
purposes of reviewing representations and warranties.

Please review the enclosed at your convenience and advise of any comments.
Thank you.

No.  Why is Rebecca Walker telling Cheryl how to do this?

Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question 
concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and 
assumption agreement.

The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being 
subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent 
problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has 
coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened 
until there is a certainty of closing.

A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I 
will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this 
transaction.

We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement, 
based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark 
transaction.    I'll make the changes.

Hope this information is helpful.

My only warning is that working for Sheila is that she takes over most of the 
big stuff, even if it is your deal. Everything that she is working on now was 
one of her lawyers' deals, but "things just weren't getting done".  She can 
be very unclear in what she expects from you.  She is the ultimate 
micro-manager.  She may hire the outside counsel on "your" deal, then tell 
you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use.   
This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working 
closely with someone.  Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and 
she is very, very nice.  

I'm sure there will be a downside to working with Jeff and Barbara, I just 
haven't been in the group long enough to have an opinion.

Peter, the distribution list on this is different from the ESA deal (each

from GE's side.

To complete the exhibits, we need to include the following:

1. Exhibits H-2 and R need to be added.

2. Do we need to add language to section B of Exhibit A-1?

Hi Carolyn,

In order to discourage Ben from continuing to direct outside counsel, please 
address as much correspondence as possible to me, or to me and him.  Ben is 
terrible (and shameless) about violating Enron policy in this regard, and I 
don't know that I can stop him, but I do need your assistance in curbing him 
as much as possible.

Thanks,

As difficult as this is to believe, we have been told that VEPCO wants
Enron to take the first crack at the interconnection agreement.  Please put
this on your list.  I will check around here to see if there is a form we
want to use as a starting point.

Barbara/Jeff:

In the  TurboPark world there will be certain impacts on how power projects 
involving physical capacity are structured and implemented.  I know some (but 
not all) of it.  I can say that it is fairly easy to bust the structure and 
wind up with assets on the balance sheet, and that the commercial folks 
aren't always (or even usually) sensitive to the issues.  Maybe after the 
first of the year those group members who will be working on the power 
origination and development side could get briefed by the finance and 
accounting folks.

Kay

Paige wrote me at 430 this am, and said that since she was still up at 430, 
she probably won't be home in time for Michael's parties.  Should I just 
leave him after gymnastics?  I don't really want to come back the office, but 
I do want to go to Anne's.  Hmmm.  If Paige is home by 500, everything might 
work.

Here's the current version.  I'm going to give it another look, then I

Is it foggy or raining?  I can't see anything out my window.

Al,

Each project must have its own break out contract - that's the deal struck 
with GE and with the lenders.  There will be no change orders to the master 
contract relating to specific projects.  The break out contract must be 
entered into "as soon as practicable". This appproach has been taken with 
Austin, LV Co Gen, and ESA, and all of those contracts are just about 
finished.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Sheila also has a good 
understanding of the structure.

Kay

Alan Larsen@ECT
12/15/2000 12:01 PM
Thanks for the material.  I guess I wasn't clear in my request, however.  I 
was assuming that we could go to the "breakouts" to the various projects just 
with a Change Order to the master contract.  If that is the case, all I'm 
asking for is the change order form that will work for GE and West LB/ 
E-Next, and be consistent across all of the projects.  If you want to 
discuss, call me at 503-464-8782.  

Pursuant to your request, attached please find the forms for the
break-out agreement and exhibits.

believe to be the execution copy.  Some things have been cleaned up, and 
Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.  I'm going to start collecting 
signatures.

The attached is a letter agreement reflecting the resolution of certain 
issues with Westinhouse relating to the Gleason and Wheatland projects.  It 
also reflects that Enron isn't going to go after SWPC for a return of an 
option payment for the Blue Girl equipment.  SWPC has requested that 
everybody sign on the dotted line, including NEPCO, EEPC and my dog Jack.  
Please review and advise if there is any problem with you obtaining signature 
for your respective groups.

I'll handle the LJM and ENA signatures.

Please call if you have any questions.

Not exactly a "yes, we can close on Wednesday".

George called back to let me know that Coral/Tejas is now out and Intergen
is taking over.  George forwarded current drafts of the documents to John
Jones of Intergen.  George has told John that Enron is interested in closing
on Wednesday, and John was to  review the documents over the weekend.
George believes he has conveyed to John that the documents have been
negotiated on the buyer's behalf, but George is uncertain whether Intergen
will find it necessary to negotiate additional or other issues.  (It is
George's understanding that John Jones is in the legal department).  I tried
to contact John Jones directly (phone 713-374-3919), but as of late Friday,
he has not returned my call.

Lee,

If this will be a dual fuel unit, it seems we should at least have a place 
holder guarantee, even if the details aren't included.  Any problem with that 
approach?

Kay

lee.johnson@ss.ps.ge.com on 12/18/2000 07:02:45 AM
Kay/Peter- 

We don't need a liquid fuel guarantee at this time, since we don't know
where the dual fuel units are going.  When that is determined, we will
provide the LF guarantee at the time the site conditions are known.  Let's
press on.

Thanks,

number and agreement reference.  To complete the agreement, we need Ben
Jacoby's fax number and a liquid fuel performance guarantee. As for the
exhibits, we need the information for Part B of Exhibit A-1.  We will
also need to add Exhibit H-2, Exhibit R (if necessary) and confirmation
that we will not have any site specific information usually contained in
Exhibit U.

Have you been able to reach Rey yet?

Mitch,

Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
something out.

Richard, any ideas or comments?

It won't hurt my feelings if you want to contact ABB's lawyer directly. His 
name is Dave Onuscheck, and his email is david.onuscheck@us.abb.com.  I'm 
home with a sick kid, and I don't have his telephone number with me.  

Peter Thompson has worked on the form.  Do you have the draft with the memo 
of issues?

Kay

This may sound like a silly question, but why?  Is this something Ben wants 
Matt doing? 

1-4 are all the CO's I know about.

I'm out today, but we can discuss it tomorrow, and I can explain my point of 
view.

Kay

   
	
	

Kay

Have you had a chance to collect the following information for Matt Tezyk:

The free storage letter from GE
Any correspondence between GE and you relating to all 24 turbines
Any change orders in addition to #1-4
Documentation on any other deals we have made with GE

Please let me know if I can help with this.  If possible, I'd like to get 
this information to Matt some time early this week.

Regards,
Rebecca

Looks ok to me.

I've heard of some of the stuff.  These items should be dealt with in the 
facility agreements for the individual projects.  ABB has had a form  of this 
agreement to comment on for a while, but we haven't heard anything.  

Hope this helps a little.

Kay

Hi Dave,

I was wondering if you have had a chance to look over the draft facility 
agreement? We would like to make some progress on the form this week.  In 
fact, you may hear (or have heard) directly from Dale Rasmussen, who is an 
Enron lawyer supporting one of the projects at issue.

There are also some change order type changes which need to be captured in 
words and made a part of the individual facility agreements, or integrated as 
changes to these agreements.

Thanks for your assistance,

Kay

After 2 parties, I'm getting party burn out.  How bad is that?

Kay

Dale tells me that he really needs ABB to get with it.  I sent an email (yet 
another) to ABB's lawyer asking for comments.  

Kay

Michael is sick with some nasty virus.  I'm a bit afraid to commit until he 
starts looking better.  Poor kid had strep last week.

Maybe he'll perk up by Thursday, but the doctor says it is a 10 day ordeal.   
I bet you would just as soon not be exposed to it.

Kay

How is Thursday night for a family dinner as we discussed.  Lastly, no news 
from anyone today on my front.  I'll call Michelle on Wednesday if I don't 
hear anything tomorrow.

I will be there!

Lisa:

Ken Raber (electricities) and I discussed the option agreement yesterday and 
came to the conclusion that any issues electricities has with the option 
agreement will go to you directly.  I believe that will streamline the 
process.

The attorney's name is Mike Colo and his telephone number is 252-972-7105.

I would really like to get this option agreement signed as soon as we can and 
I'm sure you feel the same!

If there is anything I can do let me know.

Kay:

I spoke with Ben this afternoon.  He would like me to get involved with the 
LM 6000 transaction which we are attempting to close this week.  I understand 
that the transaction negotiations started with Coral and that Intergen is the 
counterparty that we are expecting to sign the letter agreement this Thursday 
(12/21).  I also understand that Intergen is holding a Board meeting tomorrow 
at which time we expect them to seek approval for this transaction and that 
Doug Pedigo (Intergen internal counsel) is scheduled to meet with John Keffer 
(sp.?)(ENA outside counsel) tomorrow to finalize documents/arrangements for 
Thursday's closing.

The issues that Ben asked me to specifically work with you on are:

1.  Since Coral/Intergen has delayed the closing approximately 2 weeks beyond 
its initially expected date, Ben would like to see the [Letter Agreement] 
deadline for ENA to deliver "Breakout Agreements" on the turbines and 
transformers moved from 12/29/2000 to 1/15/00.  This change will allow ENA 
the time necessary to prepare the "Breakout Agreements",  the LLC 
Agreements,  the acknowledgement letter from GE, and the agreements required 
to pull the LM turbines out of the "Turbo Park" structure.

2.  I will work with yourself, Rebecca Walker, and Katherine Clark to 
assemble the agreements necessary to pull the LM turbines out of the Turbo 
Park structure.

Also, Ben wanted me to ask you who in ENA legal would be filling in for you 
while you are out of the office between Christmas and New Years.

Please call me to discuss these items.  I am in the office every day this 
week to help this and other transactions that are in a position to close.

Thanks,
Fred

Ben asked me to get involved in the NRG deal(s) that we are working on.  As I 
understand it, we are working on 2 potential deals:

 1.  With the NRG San Diego group on the sale of the [March 2001] GE 7EA.

 2.  With the NRG Thermal group on the sale of one or more LM 6000 turbines.

Ben indicated that we need to have a CA in place that covers the delivery of 
transaction documents to the San Diego group.  Ben also mentioned that Jim 
Gilbert (Enron West Coast) has executed a CA with the NRG Thermal group.

Kay:  Does the CA executed with the NRG Thermal group contain language that 
covers the delivery of documents to both NRG groups?

Chris:  Has any form of draft CA been provided to the NRG San Diego group?

Please let me know the answers to these questions.  I am in the office all 
this week and will work with both of you to help move these deals forward.

I will review it tomorrow and touch base with you or Kay.  I will be at a
closing the next two days, which has tied me up for weeks, but 99% of the work
for it should be done today.  That will give me time to focus on this.  I will
call tomorrow.

Kay Mann passed along your e-mail address when I asked about how I could be
of help in moving the Facility Agreement "breakout contract" forward.

I am working on a transaction that will require that we have the ability to
The counterparty to our transaction has pressed us for a copy of the
contract under which the transformers will be conveyed.  I understand that
you have been working with Kay on the form of contract.  To the extent that
I can provide any input or can otherwise move the process along, I am
anxious to do so.

Please give me a call to discuss how we can move the process forwards.  I
can be reached at (503) 464-8863.

Thanks.

It is basically the same.

If this is the same as the previous letter that you circulated, Dick Westfahl 
can sign for it and he indicated that he had no problems with it.

The attached is a letter agreement reflecting the resolution of certain 
issues with Westinhouse relating to the Gleason and Wheatland projects.  It 
also reflects that Enron isn't going to go after SWPC for a return of an 
option payment for the Blue Girl equipment.  SWPC has requested that 
everybody sign on the dotted line, including NEPCO, EEPC and my dog Jack.  
Please review and advise if there is any problem with you obtaining signature 
for your respective groups.

I'll handle the LJM and ENA signatures.

Please call if you have any questions.

I am not sure what you are asking for both maybe the scope of work.  I

spring option and four exhaust  STACKS.  The water injection skids were 
options also.  I am on vacation but please call me at 936-399-4831 as son as 
you receive this.

I believe the amount should be calculated through the date of funding.  Will 
closing and funding take place tomorrow, or will funding be a day later?

For ESA to exercise its LM 6000 purchase option, it must pay the Option 
Exercise Price of $101,249,431 (per section 3A of the Option Agreement) plus 
an additional charge of $21,500 per day for each day after November 22d (per 
section 3B of the Option Agreement).  If the option is exercised on December 
20th, the total amount to be paid would be:

Option Exercise Price      $101,249,431
Plus: Additional Costs: $21,500 per day x 28 days =     $        602,000
Option Exercise Price plus Additional Costs  $101,851,431

Hi guys,

I need the ABB contract and the PDA at your earliest convenience so that I 
can work on the documents we discussed.

Thanks,

Kay

De nada.

XXXXXOOOOOO

These are the current drafts of the proposed documents relating to the 
Intergen transaction.

Kay
Attached are clean and redlined versions of revised drafts of (i) the
Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA
Energy Development I, LLC and the GE generator set, and (ii) the Letter
Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to the ABB
transformer.  The Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP
relating to CA Energy Development II, LLC and the GE generator set will
be in the same form as item (i) above with changes to reflect the proper
LLC.

To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before
review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have
additional changes and comments.

In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for
Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following
requirements of InterGen:

(i)  The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been
deleted;

(ii)  A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable
efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of
Section 3; and

(iii)  A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been
added as  a new Section 17.

The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted
from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my
understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's
agreement with TRY.  ENA would nevertheless be protected by the general
language of the clause.

Although InterGen is still reviewing these documents for tax and other
concerns, for now the only contemplated changes to the LLC Agreements
and the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters are those needed to reflect
the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

InterGen is still reviewing the Facility Agreement and exhibits
thereto.

I have passed on ENA's suggestion regarding the extension of the
closing date, but have not yet had a response from InterGen.

Doug Pedigo will be tied up tomorrow morning, but Doug and I are
available after lunch for a telephone conference to discuss any comments
you have on the closing.

George

12/19/2000 06:06 PM
Kay and I would like to get together tomorrow (Wednesday) morning to discuss 
the Intergen transaction.  Specifically, we would like to discuss: 1) the 
steps/timeline associated with assigning the equipment from TurboPark to 
Intergen, and 2) the accounting condition(s) required to be satisfied in 
order for the transaction value to be booked as 2000 earnings.

Intergen is holding a Board meeting this afternoon and the Enron/Intergen 
transaction is on the agenda for approval.   We expect to hear the results of 
that Board meeting sometime tomorrow morning.  If Intergen receives Board 
approval to proceed, our current goal is to have the transaction documents in 
a final form for signing on Thursday of this week.  This would allow us to 
notify TurboPark on Thursday or Friday of our intent to assign the equipment 
to Intergen.  It is unclear if this assignment can be accomplished by 12/29.

Kay has a meeting at 10 am.  Can we me at 8:30 or 9:00 a.m.?  Call/email me 
to confirm the time and location of this meeting.

Thanks,
Fred

Randy:

As I indicated in my voicemail, Coral has requested that Intergen (or its 
designated project affiliate - Sweetgum Energy L.P.) be the counterparty that 
transacts with Enron.  Based on current information, the structure of the 
transaction has not materially changed from the Coral deal structure 
described in the 11/30/00 DASH.  Intergen is holding a Board meeting this 
afternoon and the proposed transaction is on the agenda for approval.

With regard to the timing of the funding, it is my understanding that once 
the Letter Agreement has been executed (target date: 12/21) and associated 
documents accepted by Intergen, Enron will notify TurboPark of its intention 
to assign the equipment to Intergen (target notice date: 12/22).  Once the 
assignment documents are ready for execution, Intergen will fund the 
transaction and Enron will execute the assignment documents immediately after 
receiving written confirmation that Enron has received the transaction 
proceeds.  There is a desire by East Origination to, if possible, book the 
earnings from this transaction in fiscal year 2000.

Rebecca Walker (ENA development) is planning to run a D&B report on Sweetgum 
Energy L.P.  tomorrow once she receives the State and Headquarters 
information necessary.  I traded voicemails with Ben Glisan today on this 
counterparty change.  He asked that I work with RAC deal personell on this 
matter. 

Based upon your voicemail it appears that we do not need to amend the DASH 
based upon this change in counterparty.  Let me know if any of the above 
information changes your opinion.  

Call me if you wish to discuss this information.

Thanks,
Fred Mitro

Attached is the override letter which was used in connection with the LM6000 
turbine contract as it was moved into TurboPark.  This letter highlights the 
97-10 and lender requirements.  I hope you find it useful.

This is the type of letter that was included for the Pastoria and Blue Dog 
equipment.  This shows one approach to assignment under TurboPark.  This is 
also included in the other override, it is just easier to access here for 
assignment:

Hi John,

I took very poor notes from your phone call.  Did you want to see a form of 
LOI?  For what type of transaction?

Thanks,

Kay

Did Sheila want Scott to participate?  Looks like the call will be too late 
for him.

I presume you haven't heard anything or else you would have said something.  
I haven't heard a word...

Can't hurt!

All quiet on the Western front.  I'm going to call Michelle later today just 
to check-in before the holidays.

Boyd,

I would think that at the least we would want you to attend the hearing.  I 
also don't see any harm in you reviewing the data responses.

Kay

The attached gives notice of what I believe would be a scheduling (status)
conference for the Master Sales approval proceedings. This is the first
information I've received about these matters since receiving the data
requests a couple of weeks ago. Let me know how active you would like me to
be in these matters. Shoud I request that Jerry Fox circulate drafts of the
data responses? are you being kept up to date by Peoples on communications
with staff? Should I plan to attend the hearing?
                                     
                    
g.fox@pecorp.com                                                              
                 
                                     

At my request (I will out of town from December 29 through January 5), the
hearing scheduled for January 3 at 11 am has been continued to January 10
at
11 am.

Attached is a copy of the last draft of the LLC Agreement prepared by
ENA which I have revised to incorporate the changes discussed in your
recent telephone conversation with Doug Pedigo.  In the interest of
time, I have not revised the attached LLC Agreement to reflect the
substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

Section 6.1(c)(iii) was revised to reflect Sweetgum's right to freely
assign its LLC interest.  Section 6.2(a) was revised to reflect
Sweetgum's right to exercise the call at any time if it either obtains
or waives the GE consent.  Section 6.2(c) was revised to allow ENA to
exercise its put at any time (i) if it obtains GE's consent in form and
substance satisfactory to Sweetgum in its sole discretion or (ii) after
all GE warranties have expired.

To expedite matters, I am forwarding these changes to you at the same
time I am forwarding them to Doug.

I don't believe Ben agreed to absolutely free transferablity on their part.  
To ponder.

the name.  Please send it to me and Lee Johnson tomorrow, if possible.

Kay
 <<Comparison of Section 10.8.4.DOC>> 

Attached is a blackline showing my proposed change to Section 10.8.4 of
the agreements to serve as a placeholder for the liquid fuel guarantee.
Do you want something more definitive, such as a section heading and a
[To be provided when site conditions at the Facility become known]?
Also, are you waiting on any other deliverables from me or are we just
awaiting comments from the respective business teams?

Lee Johnson would like to come in tomorrow or Friday to sign the Facility 
Agreement.  Are we ready to go?  He really wants to get this done before the 
holidays.

Thanks,

Kay

Pete,

Please call me after you have reviewed this.

Kay
I have not yet received all of InterGen's comments on the documents,
however, to expedite matters, I am passing on some additional comments
on the letter agreements and the form of Facility Agreement to be
attached to the letter agreements.

Letter Agreements:  Sections 3(a) and 3.(b) of all three letter
agreements should be revised as noted in the attached form of letter
agreement.

Facility Agreements:  

1.  The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility
Agreements should be amended to read as follows:

"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below."

This is the same comment I made earlier.

2.  Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from
the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility
Agreement.

3.  The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I
as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement.

4.  Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is
still relevant.

5.  Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to
Section 10.8.4 is unclear.  I believe Tom Seigler brought this up point
up with Ben before Coral left the proposed transaction.

6.  The references throughout the Exhibits to "oF" should be corrected
to contain the degree symbol.

Can someone in your office (or the Houston office) put together the execution 
copies of this agreement?  We will need three originals.

Thanks,

Kay

Per your request.

Fred Mitro@ECT

Randy:

Based upon our discussions with Intergen this afternoon, there is a desire of 
both Enron and Intergen to execute the transaction documents tomorrow 
afternoon.  I need to determine if RAC believes that the 11/30/00 [Coral 
Energy] DASH is sufficient for the transaction signing to proceed tomorrow or 
if a revised DASH needs to be prepared and circulated for re-approval.

Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal structure 
are as follows:

1.  At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed 
transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated 
affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.).

2.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the 
requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee.  The major risk (i.e. 
non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been 
mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the 
transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment 
Assigment Agreement.

3.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a 
"no-shop" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the 
turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the Letter 
Agreement(s).

4.  Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the modification 
of the transaction "sunset dates".  These are the dates by which, once the 
Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the required Facilities 
Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully executed Assignment 
Agreement.  This modification proposes that the dates be moved from 12/29/00 
to 1/15/01.  The Enron commercial deal team is awaiting confirmation from 
Enron Global Finance that the executed Assignment Agreement can be delivered 
within these timeframes.

5.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the 
Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment 
warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen.  The 
modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its "put 
option" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by 
requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written 
consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to Intergen. 
 This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an earlier 
potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the current 
Agreement language.

Please review this information and let me know (via email) if RAC requires 
the DASH to be revised and re-approved.

Call me to discuss.

Fred

For the purposes of completing the facility agreement, we need the 
name/address of the contact person for invoices, etc.

Thanks,

Just a reminder: the contract gives us 30 days to give them written notice.  
I'm not sure when the clock started ticking - the contract says something 
about the supervisory personnel at the facility becoming aware of the 
problem. (paraphrasing, of course).

   

Kay -

Looks good.  I'll work to fill in some of the details.

To make matters worse, one of the two units had a compressor blade break off, 
taking the whole unit down (lost 180 Mw).  We might want to hold off until 
Monday when we have a better idea of the total damage and the total time the 
unit will be down.

Mitch

   

Mitch,

Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
something out.

Richard, any ideas or comments?

First installment of finance comments.
Lisa Bills
12/20/2000 07:14 PM
I have reviewed the Transformer and Turbine Letter Agreements I received 
today.

Transformer Letter

2(a) & 3(e):  why is there usage of "ABB et al." when ABB is defined?  Also, 
the "certain agreement" referred to in both sections is NOT between ENA and 
ABB.  It's now between E-Next Generation LLC as purchaser, ENA as agent for 
purchaser, and ABB, as amended.

3(a):  have two sets of "(i), (ii)" in para.  It's also unclear what this 
para actually says.

4:  definition of "Term" should go after (b) no?

Turbine Letter

3(a):  Para is clearer than in Transformer but still difficult to understand.

3(f):  Don't understand this para. and what happens with the final payment 
due to GE.

3(g):  the "certain agreement" is not between GE and ENA.  See first comment 
under Transformer Letter.  There is also the usage of "et al." after GE.

4:  same comment as in Transformer Letter.

I haven't had a chance to review the LLC Agreement yet.

Did they have anything later than 900?

I just spoke with Delores. She will call in the Rx for us. She said they are
working a short day Friday am. I told her Paige would be in with Michael at
9am...She hadn't heard about Shane. NM

You won't get me to bet on this one.

I hope they agree to the escrow

Fred Mitro@ECT
12/20/2000 06:22 PM

Randy:

Based upon our discussions with Intergen this afternoon, there is a desire
of both Enron and Intergen to execute the transaction documents tomorrow
afternoon.  I need to determine if RAC believes that the 11/30/00 [Coral
Energy] DASH is sufficient for the transaction signing to proceed tomorrow
or if a revised DASH needs to be prepared and circulated for re-approval.

Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal
structure are as follows:

1.  At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed
transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated
affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.).

2.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the
requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee.  The major risk (i.e.
non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been
mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the
transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment
Assigment Agreement.

3.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a
"no-shop" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the
turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the
Letter Agreement(s).

4.  Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the
modification of the transaction "sunset dates".  These are the dates by
which, once the Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the
required Facilities Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully
executed Assignment Agreement.  This modification proposes that the dates
be moved from 12/29/00 to 1/15/01.  The Enron commercial deal team is
awaiting confirmation from Enron Global Finance that the executed
Assignment Agreement can be delivered within these timeframes.

5.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the
Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment
warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen.  The
modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its "put
option" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by
requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written
consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to
Intergen.  This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an
earlier potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the
current Agreement language.

Please review this information and let me know (via email) if RAC requires
the DASH to be revised and re-approved.

Call me to discuss.

Thank you for your interest in the upcoming Weight Watchers session starting

why you have not received a response to your e-mails.  As stated in the 
announcement, space is limited to the first 60 persons who respond via 
e-mail.  As an update, let me inform you that Michelle has received 31

 Please remember that Michelle will be sending out e-mail confirmations upon

Attached is the  form of override letter to be executed at the same time as 
the GE facility agreement.  It addresses accounting issues and lender 
requirements.

I should have a final draft of the GE facility agreement later today.

How about notices going to CA Development, "care of" this contact.  CA 
doesn't have any employees.

Shouldn't these  be cc's under the Facility Agreement?  Don't we want CA
Development to also get copies of all notices?

Placeholder.

Do we need to include the information for Part B of Exhibit A-1 at this
time or should we just leave a placeholder?

Guess we need to make the final decision.
I have booked the 9:45 seating for New Year's eve at Sambuca's Jazz Cafe. Mr. 
Pink will be performing until 1:15am ( I know that's late for you Cheryl). 
The $100 per person fee covers food and entertainment. The meal will have a 
couple of options and sounded very good when read to me over the phone. 
Gratuity of 18%, tax, and alcohol are not included. We can all settle up on 
the night so no one has to worry about that until next year!!

We have one extra seat so if someone has a good idea of how to fill it, 
please let me know asap. Until I next see each of you, have great holiday and 
drive safely.

turn on my cell phone when I leave the office.

Not really.  It was a format agreed to for all the LM's because the intent in 
most cases is to sell the project (and the equipment), and the terms in the 
override letter only apply when the equipment is in the financing structure.

Kay, was this letter necessary b/c accounting rules did not allow us to have 
these items in the Purchase Agreement?  

I had the call anyway with Mike and Steve.  We actually made progress in 
outlining the issues.  Mike should be generating an email.  We voted to take 
next week off. Hope that's ok.

Sorry I missed the call.  I was up to eyeballs in PSCO and caught in a very 
COLD and NASTY blizzard in Toronto in my little suit and heels!  I'm trying 
to get home.  Maybe tomorrow.

	
	

Eric,
We are moving ahead to have legal turn a turbine purchase agreement.  As 
discussed on Tuesday morning, we must turn an offer to People's on Friday 
July 14.  I want to assure that all parties have provided enough time and 
attention to 1) review a document 2) provide comments and 3) provide a 
legally binding (conditioned on ABB requirements) offer to PEC.

Please contact me with questions or comments @ 312/541-1225.

Thanx,
Laura

Are we just going to go with the contact at Sweetgum, or are we also
going to add Ben?

I asked Fred to check into what it would take to have Enron set up a third 
party escrow arrangement.

Kay
Fred Mitro@ECT
12/22/2000 08:59 AM
I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury.  She indicated that we are currently 
working with Chase Bank and City Bank for our third party escrow Agreements.  
Mary will forward Kay and I electronic copies of both of their standard 
agreements.  The timeline for a standard agreement is at least 3 days and 
increases with the level of complexity of the Escrow Agreement's terms & 
conditions.  The cost for either bank to set-up and administer the escrow 
would be approximately $5-$10K, with additional cost if the Agreement was 
overly complex.

Kay:  Call me to discuss our proposed Escrow Agreement T&C's and how a draft 
form of this Agreement should be best incorporated into the transaction 
documents.  At a minimum, we should attach it as a sample form and have the 
Letter Agreement(s) contain "substantially in conformance with" language.

Fred

	Enron Global Finance
	

As I discussed with Fred this morning, attached are escrow agreements for 
both Citibank and Chase.  Let me know which one you want to talk to and I 
will hook you up with the agent.

EECC may have this.  Can you check with whoever your team is working with, or 
do you want a copy job of what was in the master agreement?

Kay
Exhibit B-1 was not in the electronic version of the West LB Agreement.
Do you have an electronic version of this?  If not, can we get a copy
from Lee?

For Las Vegas the West LB exhibit is the appropriate Exhibit.

                                                      
                                                      
                                                      

For the Enron South America and CA Development deals, we have used the
attached Exhibit B-1 (with all changes accepted).  Should this also be
used for the other deals as well or should we use the B-1 from the West
LB Agreement?

Kay,

I had a copy of the last redline for Exhibit B-1.  Don't have execution
copy.

On Exhibit h-2, Training -- I'll look for it, but think Kathy had it
last to
identify it as H-2.

Thanks,

Lee
Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless
there is some reason to handle it otherwise.

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do

Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for
the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on
Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change
to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2,
this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect
scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit
liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads,
guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire
contract
document.

Regards,

Lee

Kay,

I edited the Termination Schedule replacing the term Purchase Amount per
unit to Unit Liability Amount for consistency with the new structure.

Lee

 <<Exhibits to Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - without notations.DOC>>

This is the most recent draft of the exhibits.

The following items need to be added to complete the exhibits:

1.   Exhibits B-1 and H-2 need to be added.

2.   If one is warranted, a Seller Parent Guarantee should be
included as Exhibit C-1.

3.   Does Exhibit F need to be updated and revised before signing?

4.   In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5.   For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all
documents that it should have received by now.

As you predicted.

George has confirmed that F&J is unwilling to act as escrow agent

I asked Fred to check into what it would take to have Enron set up a third
party escrow arrangement.

I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury.  She indicated that we are currently
working with Chase Bank and City Bank for our third party escrow
Agreements.  Mary will forward Kay and I electronic copies of both of their
standard agreements.  The timeline for a standard agreement is at least 3
days and increases with the level of complexity of the Escrow Agreement's
terms & conditions.  The cost for either bank to set-up and administer the
escrow would be approximately $5-$10K, with additional cost if the
Agreement was overly complex.

Kay:  Call me to discuss our proposed Escrow Agreement T&C's and how a
draft form of this Agreement should be best incorporated into the
transaction documents.  At a minimum, we should attach it as a sample form
and have the Letter Agreement(s) contain "substantially in conformance
with" language.

Brian,
I spoke to Karl today, and we tried to find the "MOU".  All we have found
was the "Assignment & Assumption Letter" you mention.
In that document, the Enron and GE entities were; Enron Capitol & Trade
Resources Corp. and General Electric Company, respectively.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

I have a copy of the "Assignment and Assumption Letter"  where GE agreed
that
Cogen Technologies could assign the rights to purchase the Units to Enron
Capital and Trade Resources, Corp.

The initials at the ECT signature block is Doug Pedigo's.

I have always been a little confused when Karl Siverling talks about voiding
an
MOU, because I do not remember ever seeing an MOU for the Cogen Tech  units.

Perhaps we could ask Karl to send us a copy of the document he intends to
void
to make the process easier.

Weak excuse!  It lasts for 16 weeks...

Thank you for your interest in the upcoming Weight Watchers session starting 
July 19th. Unfortunately, the person in charge of confirming your 
participation (Michelle Kapfer) is out on vacation until July 17th, which is 
why you have not received a response to your e-mails.  As stated in the 
announcement, space is limited to the first 60 persons who respond via 
e-mail.  As an update, let me inform you that Michelle has received 31 
responses (from you guys); of course, this does not take into account the 
previous other responses she may have received from last session's members. 

 Please remember that Michelle will be sending out e-mail confirmations upon 
her return on the 17th.  

Thanks again,

Kay,

Do you know who signed on behalf on ENA on this agreement back in June, and 
if so can you notify them that this needs to be signed again with the lone 
amendment being the Counteparty to ENA on the original LOI was General 
Electric Company, not GE Power Systems and GE Int'l.  Let me knwo if you have 
any questions.

Steve:

Attached are both a black-lined and a clean version of the referenced 
document which was revised upon receipt of a copy of the final version of the 
Termination Agreement.

No one has said anything to me about closing next week.  Lee Johnson is on 
vacation next week also, so GE won't be around.

Kay

Do we have the anticipated closing date for the LV Cogen deal?  I wasn't
planning on returning to the office until January 3.

EECC may have this.  Can you check with whoever your team is working
with,
or do you want a copy job of what was in the master agreement?

Kay
Exhibit B-1 was not in the electronic version of the West LB Agreement.
Do you have an electronic version of this?  If not, can we get a copy
from Lee?

For Las Vegas the West LB exhibit is the appropriate Exhibit.

For the Enron South America and CA Development deals, we have used the
attached Exhibit B-1 (with all changes accepted).  Should this also be
used for the other deals as well or should we use the B-1 from the West
LB Agreement?

Kay,

I had a copy of the last redline for Exhibit B-1.  Don't have execution
copy.

On Exhibit h-2, Training -- I'll look for it, but think Kathy had it
last to
identify it as H-2.

Thanks,

Lee

Geez.

The original contract covered 24 LM6000 turbines.  The "break-out contracts" 
cover the turbines going to specific projects.  There is a provision in the 
original LM6000 contract which contemplates "facility agreements" covering 
one or more of the LM6000 turbines.  We call them "break out contracts" as a 
short-hand reference.

don't want you to feel left out
Although InterGen has not completed its review of the Facility
Agreements, at Kay Mann's suggestion and to expedite matters, I am
passing on changes which InterGen requires with respect to Sections
17.3(a) and 17.4.1 of both Facility Agreements:

1.  Section 17.3(a) should be revised to read as follows:  

"promptly refund the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion
of the Purchase Amount) and pay Cover Damages plus Termination Costs
described in Sections 17.4.2(i) and 17.4.2(iv) described below; or"

2.  The third and fourth sentences of Section 17.4.1 should be revised
to read as follows:

"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below.  If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is less than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Scope Value Due")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below."

It is InterGen's understanding that the Purchase Amount is currently
$1,829,000, subject to adjustment by future change orders, and that the
amounts previously paid plus the Purchase Amount are equal to the
Maximum Liability Amount of $14,352,000, subject to adjustment by future
change orders.  It is essential to InterGen that CA Development I and CA
Development II receive credit for the amounts previously paid and that
they not be required to go outside of the Facility Agreement to
determine such amounts.

Carlos,

Could you tell me which of the 4 documents to print, etc?  Unfortunately I 
have about 10 things getting signed today and I'm perplexed with what I need 
to do here and I  can't these to figure out.  Which one are you 
printing/signing?

Thanks,

Lee Johnson is coming in today to sign off on the turbine contract.  Is ESA 
ready to go with this one?

Thanks,

Lisa Bills and I spoke concerning this transaction, and what kind of document 
we can put in front of Peoples at this time.  Here are the highlights from 
our conversation:

Enron can't enter into a binding commitment to purchase the equipment without 
putting the Moore project on the balance sheet.  Therefore, either WestLB 
needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an 
option agreement.  There is room in the WestLB facility for the turbines; 
however, RAC needs to approve the purchase.  Lisa advises that Transaction 
Support (Herman or Roger) needs to buy in as well.

I understand we would like to present a binding agreement to Peoples 
tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the 
Moore project off the balance sheet. 

I'm available to discuss this.  Lisa advises that she will be in tomorrow as 
well.

Lisa, please correct me if any of this is not accurate.

Attached is a Client Alert, which discusses amendments to the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 that were signed this
week by the President.  As you know, the HSR Act imposes a premerger
notification obligation for mergers and acquisitions exceeding certain size
thresholds.

The amendments take effect as of February 1, 2001 and govern transactions
that close on or after that date.  As anticipated, the amendments increase
the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 million to $50 million, and they
eliminate the 15% prong of the size-of-transaction threshold.  They also
eliminate the size-of-person threshold for transactions with a value
exceeding $200 million.  Congress projects that about half of filings will
be eliminated under the new thresholds.  The amendments also adopt a
three-tier filing fee structure, with filing fees increased for larger
transactions.

Kathleen, the signature pages are for a CLOSING NEXT FRIDAY, December 28 in 
Washington DC.  The pages are for a Consent to an Assignment of a completed 
EPC contract involving a special purpose company of Tampa Electric Company 
("TECO").  ECT's role was to purchase the turbines and NEPCO did the work.  
The work has been completed but is still in the warranty phase and thus the 
banks want this assignment agreement so that can also enjoy the warranty 
rights.  The document is complex because the financing structure is complex 
(there is prior existing senior debt, new subordinated debt and a sale and 
lease back structure.)  My understanding is that Janet Dietrich did the 
original transaction.  If you want a copy of the Consent Agreement as 
modified, please call Angie and she will fax it to you.  Also, you can leave 
me a voicemail if you want me to debrief someone on the project.  In 
addition, you can tell people that Jason Peters of Andrews & Kurth also 
helped in the review and editing of the contract.  If you want to call him 
directly he can describe the deal to you (he indicated that he has worked 
with you.)  Lastly, you will need to fax an executed copy of the agreement to 
Babak Hoghooghi of the Washington, DC office of Skadden Arps and will need to 
federal express the originals to him as well.  I am giving him your name as 
his contact at ENA.  I have already sent him the NEPCO signed pages.  Thanks 
and happy new year.  Lastly, leave me a voicemail at work if you need to 
reach as I will check it on Wednesday.

Thanks Kay.

On the GE and ABB contracts, we will be assigning the breakout contracts down 
to the project development entity (LVC2).  LVC2 will then make a partial 
assignment of the guaranty/LD/warranty provisions to the EPC contractor.

Have you done an assignment of this nature in connection with any other 
equipment?  If so, do you have some language I could use?

Thanks, and happy holidays!

Per the prior e-mail, I am forwarding the InterGen draft of an ENA

Citibank has advised me that we need Enron to provide an incumbency
certificate.  I've attached a blank one for you to fill in the appropriate
people.  They need this as soon as possible.  They also need us to insert
wiring instructions into each of the Escrow agreements - I am in the process
of inserting our instructions - please provide your wiring instructions as
soon as possible.

start with the WestLB Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption form and 
redraft it to include what we want and think the bank will require in 
addition to what they asked for.

Good morning.

I didn't wake Paige up this am.  I told Michael he could wake her up when he 
wanted to, which I presume didn't take long.

It feels good to be back.  Last week really wasn't a very good week to take 
off, and I was really stressed. It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two 
weeks!  I'm glad, since Michael is off then as well.

Did you make friends with your venison (or was is pork)?

Love,

Kay

Attached are the execution copies of the Turbo Park documents that are 
relevant to power plant equipment procurement and development.   I have asked 
Finance to provide us with summaries of the relevant provisions since the 
120+ page Participation Agreement, which is largely a loan agreement, is very 
complex.  I will nevertheless attempt to summarize the "process" of getting 
into and out of TurboPark.  In the meantime, please familiarize yourselves 
with the documents.

Thanks.  Suzanne just gave me the documents.  I like having the electronic 
versions as well.

I can't believe it feels so good to be back.  I must be crazy.

Hi again,

I'm looking for the language regarding invoicing which was requested last 
week.  I want to address it with GE today.

Thanks,

Kay

A small change...
Carolyn,

In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from
"LLC" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements:

CA Energy Development I, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901

and as follows for the other:

CA Energy Development II, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010

Give a read and then a call to discuss the notice and the timing of the 
purchase.  Thanks, Lisa
KWiemer@milbank.com on 12/22/2000 06:19:11 AM
Lisa - The notice under 6.1(a) of the DCMA for Property to be purchased out 
of the facility should specify simply: 

1.????? The proposed Applicable Construction Purchase Date (between 5 and 15 
Business Days after the date of the notice).? By my count we don't have 5 BDs 
left in the year.? If you want to do by year end you will need a waiver.

2.????? The Specified Option Property - which should be described with 
sufficient specificity for the Developer to prepare a legally sufficient 
quitclaim deed or bill of sale and assignment pursuant to 7.1 of the DCMA, 
and the party owning the property (Developer or Developer Subsidiary or 
other).? For your purposes now, this should be fairly straightforward - we 
will be doing just a Bill of Sale and an assignment.? Serial numbers, 
location and any other information for positive identification of any 
equipment should suffice, and as to contract rights that is just a reference 
to the appropriate contract(s) and the rights to be assigned thereunder (if 
not all).? In future, this element will be driven by the type of Property you 
are taking out. 

3.????? Designate the amount of Project Costs Attributable to the Specified 
Option Property.? Note that this works hand in hand with the voluntary 
prepayment section under the PA, Section 2.1G for Phase I.? I assume you're 
in LIBOR right now, so you need to give a minimum 3 B.D. notice of 
prepayment, and it is irrevocable. You might as well incorporate the notice 
of prepayment into the Purchase Option Exercise Notice.

The Developer will need to produce and deliver a Bill of Sale and an 
assignment based on the information you provide, so please copy me on the 
information you send to CSFB.? 

I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with Jon (generally or about 
the waiver issue) or anyone else, so please go ahead and start on the notice 
with the knowledge that there may be further comment and a requirement for 
further information.? Why don't you produce one version that includes a 
request for a waiver of the 5 Business Day requirement and an "acknowledged 
and consented to" signature line for CSFB as Admin Agent.? As you suggested 
on the phone, it may be worthwhile to produce a form for this kind of 
notice.? Let's consider doing that after the first of the year so we can be 
sure to anticipate all that must be included. There may be other items we 
want to establish a form or precedent for too, depending on what features of 
the facility you see Enron using frequently. 

Let's speak about this early today, obviously. And we must be sure we have 
enough Business Days left in the year to pull this off - LIBOR Business Days 
would be the only problem I could imagine, I'm just unable to check that 
right now.

Talk to you soon, I'll be in the office by 9 or 9:30.? And why did it take 
you so long to get active on this facility? Such a nice credit and you just 
let it sit there for days! 

Cheers, Karl

I have copies of the Articles of Organization, the LLC Agreement, and a
member's consent electing officers for each of the entities (and provided
these to George by fax on 12/7).  George advised last week that SEL wanted
the originals of the "minute books" for the two entities.   Therefore ENA
should prepare to have the original organizational documents ("minute
books") ready for delivery to SEL at closing.  I am unaware of any efforts
to obtain federal EIN's for these entities.  Thanks.

Carolyn,

Happy New Year!

Here is the Citibank Schedule of Fees updated with the "Waived for initial
setup" and the "F." in Ben's name.

Do you have the wiring instructions yet so I can put them in the escrow
documents and circulate those docs as final??

Thanks,

It the dark recesses of my mind I recall that Honey has a form to fill out.  
However, that doesn't keep us from distributing $.  We just need to keep 
enough to pay CT to file the documents.

Congratulations, that was quite a feat. 

Time for a Fish wake?

OK-----I finally have the last (Bailey) signature on those going out of
business documents.  What shall I do with them?  When can we write checks
and be done with all this?

Gerry Turner

GE is asking for invoicing instructions for equipment currently in TP.  I 
don't recall that being addressed in the documents they signed, and  I didn't 
see an obvious answer in the documents I reviewed.  Any problem with Ben 
receiving the invoices for now, then he can process through GF, etc?

Thanks,

They need to have their partner sign a confidentiality agreement, or at least 
we need to add language that they won't disclose it to them without having 
them sign a confidentiality agreement in substantially the same form as this 
one.

Kay,

I spoke to Freddy Sanches regarding the ENA / Avista Steag CA.  Avista Steag 
wants to be able to provide turbine performance data to their project partner 
(who will not be disclosed in the CA).  Mr. Sanches suggested I add some 
language to this effect to paragraph 1 of the CA.

Additionally, Mr. Sanches wants me to change the defined term of AAvista 
STeag LLC to "STEAG" rather than Avista.

Attached is a revised CA - Please advise.

unsigned originals somewhere?

Hi guys,

Here's a suggested revision to the invoicing language.

Lee, I've asked the question about the other invoices.  If we don't get an 
immediate answer, I think you can send the invoices to Ben, and we can 
process them here.  I'm always happy to volunteer Ben.  By the way, I haven't 
given Ben his signing party favor, as he hasn't been in Houston since we last 
met.

Kay:  I don't have an executed Peoples Energy Resources.  I have a draft from 
12/21/99 - perhaps it's out there signed somewhere - relating to "possible 
joint energy generation projects".

I have an executed Peoples Energy Services Corporation agreement dated 
7/19/99 for two years re "Discussion re exploration of certain opportunities 
for assisting People's upstream load requirements for electric energy and, to 
the extent permitted by and consistent with PESC's existing contractual 
commitments with other parties, natural gas, that may result in transactions 
between ECT and PESC"

and an agreement with Peoples Energy Corporation that expired July 6, 2000 re

Ben has asked me to prepare a draft Bill of Sale - Equipment schedule to 
support the closing of the Intergen transaction.

I have generated the attached spread sheet showing the following information 
for the two LM6000 turbines and the one ABB transformer:

 Unit Description (Column A)
 Unit Number (Column B)
 Unit Serial # (Column C)
 Unit Delivery Date (Column D)
 Physical location of the units as of the date of schedule (1/5/01) (Column E)
 The equipment and all rights provided to Buyer under Agreement dated ____ 
(Column F)

I have filled in descriptions for each piece of equipment (Column A).  I need 
help with the following:

Chris:  Please fill in Columns B, C, D & E with current information from our 
equipment contracts.

Rebecca:  Please obtain the information for Columns A, B, C, D, E, & F  from 
Catherine in Global Finance.  This should be the information that was 
recorded in the TurboPark financing documents when the equipment option 
agreements were moved into TurboPark from West LB.

Kay:  Please fill in the dates for Column F and let me know if any additional 
information is required to complete this schedule.

Please forward me a revised copy of this spreadsheet once you have completed 
the relevant information.  I welcome your input on the information contained 
within this schedule.

Our goal here is to create a schedule which is factually correct (based on 
all of the relevant agreements) and does not create any 
inconsistencies/conflicts with the TurboPark documents.  We need to deliver a 
draft of this schedule to the TurboPark banks tomorrow  for their review.  
This schedule represents one of four documents required to effect a smooth 
transfer of the relevant equipment interests from TurboPark into the 
respective CA Development entity and close this transaction prior to the 
1/15/01 deadline.

Call me to discuss any of this information.

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

Hi Roger,

We are going forward with the first deal to move stuff out of TurboPark.  I 
don't know if you want to see these types of documents, but what the heck, 
here it is!

I haven't seen it come back.  I spoke with Lynn around Christmas, and he said 
the person who would sign was out of town, but was supposed to be back last 
week.  I'll be glad to follow up.   I was out last week and just haven't 
worked to that point on my "to do" list.

NEPCO and EECC have signed, by the way.

I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, 
with a simultaneous sale of  80% of the equity to a third party.  This deal 
is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark 
and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.  I thought I would 
share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy.

Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to 
take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is 
required.

There will be other documents involved as well:

Bill of Sale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment)

I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to 
come on this one.

As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised.

I've been told by Global Finance that this is how TurboPark stuff gets 
invoiced.  I'm thinking it might help if copies are sent to project people.  
What do you think?

Kay,

Please confirm that this will be the invoicing address for the 6 units bound
for Fountain Valley Project and 4 units pegged to LV Cogen Expansion.  Also,
we've still got a change order needed for Fountain Valley for the 6 Power
System Stabilizers and 2 Exhaust Stacks.  LV is also saying they will need 4
Power System Stabilizers, but haven't confirmed their order.

Lee,

The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy 
the Enron project folks you have been dealing with.  

Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?  I would think that we 
could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be 
whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.  The banks won't care.

Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?

As a follow-up to our discussions yesterday afternoon, I need to obtain a 
copy of the PERC/West LB Agreements on the financing vehicle for the PERC/ABB 
Turbine Purchase Agreement(s).  Kay Mann requires these documents ASAP in 
order to finish preparing the proposed Enron/PERC Agreement on the ABB 
turbines.  Please fax these documents to Kay Mann directly at (713) 646-3491 
(Kay's phone # is 713-345-7566).  You can reach me on my cell phone at 
(713)412-4612.

Fred

I went to Sheila's meeting.  Barbara and Jeff were there also.

Hmm.  Don't know about the faxed signature.  Feel free to call Carolyn 
Campbell at King & Spalding and ask. 713 276 7307. Find out about faxed 
signature, and whether tomorrow is too late.  We need the escrow account in 
place by FRIDAY.

Is Mike Miller in? Ozzie would be fine, I guess.

Thanks,

Kay

   
	
	

	
	

Kay,

Bad news.  Ben also will not be in until tomorrow.

Do you want me to:

1. See if I can get a faxed signature for Ben (if Citibank will allow faxed 
signatures)
2. Get Delainey, Pagan and Dietrich's signatures today and wait for Ben's 
original signature tomorrow

I guess I missed Sheila's 10:00 meeting.  It's kind of confusing as to how 
long we are supposed to attend her meetings since we are with the East Group 
and she is with the West Group.  Did you go?  I am going to Barbara Gray's 
meeting at 1:00.

You know me.  I don't care one way or the other.  Is there a reason why you 
want to skip it?

We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.  I just thought that would be fun to 
do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.  We can always just go for a 
visit.  In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.  

Like I said last night, you would make a great guide.  You'll be Michael's 
guide one of these days.

ckm

You do mind if we skip this party? 

Si. Oui.  Yep.

The changes to the individual break-out agrement are being made now.  I
hope to have it to you by noon you time.  Please confirm that this
agreement is for CA Energy Development II.

Thanks.  I'm starting to proof the changes now.  Should be ready in
30-45 minutes.

Here is the information required for the Bill of Sale exhibit.   Let me know 
if any additional information is needed and I will coordinate with Chris 
Booth and Rebecca Walker.  I will draft an exhibit with this information in a 
Word document as the formal attachment.  

Does the Bill of Sale document require 2 separate exhibits (similar to the 
notice of option exhibits) or can all the information be shown on one 
exhibit?  Let me know.

Fred

Any response on the amendment to the letter agreements?

WHOA.  We are not wiring money, we are receiving money.  This should occur 
either Jan 12 or 15.

Minor detail.

Citibank just confirmed that they will also accept faxed signatures on the 
Escrow Agreement.  Have you approved it yet?  If so, and we let accounting 
know to wire the funds to Citibank before 2:00, we can get the $ in the 
Escrow Account by tomorrow.  Otherwise, the funds will not get there until 
Friday.

K-

Please email me the execution version of the escrow agreement.  Are we using 
one, two or three?

Thanks,

Kay

Sorry about the serial emails.  

I need electronic versions of the final acknowledgement letters for both ABB 
and GE, so that these can be emailed to them.  

Please prepare a closing list.  Between this and the financing side, I'm 
chasing quite a few documents.

I hope to have the escrow agreement signed today, but I would really like to 
know we have the amendment finished.

Thanks,

Kay

I prefer the weekend.  It gives us a reason to get in and get out.  

ckm

No reason other than I don't really care to go.

I really would like to do the FtW Show. Would weekends work best for you? I
checked TicketMaster and all the weekend shows are available, even the "sold
out" shows. I didn't check the price. They do have some weekday shows also
if you would rather do that.

I talked with John a few minutes ago. Here's the gist of the conversation:

1. Miller was promised the 4 7FAs based on his discussions with John 
concerning Enron's interest. GE is wavering a bit on this now, however, 
because other sales reps within GE have complained that we were given first 
crack. John characterized our current position as "the front of the line 
without a pass".

2. Ultimately (and obviously), Dell Williamson will decide to whom these 
turbines are allocated.

3. John said we should have a proposed letter agreement on the turbines this 
afternoon. He emphasized that they do not yet have the requisite GE internal 
approvals. Nonetheless, the major terms included in the Letter Agreement 
would be as follows:
- Form of turbine purchase contract would be the GenPower 7FA turbine 
purchase agreement, modified to include standard Enron provisions negotiated 
between Sheila Tweed et. al. concerning assignment, indemnities, etc.;
- the turbine purchase contract would need to be executed by the end of 
January;
- 5% of the purchase amount would need to be paid upon execution of the 
Letter Agreement, with an additional 5% due at the end of the month. The 
balance of payments in the turbine purchase agreement would be paid in equal 
monthly instalments for each turbine through the respective turbine's 
delivery date (last day of each of March, April, May, and June);
- we would be required to negotiate with GE in good faith on an LTSA, water 
system and STG (if needed). This would not be an exclusive, nor would we be 
subject to payment adders to the extent our good faith negotiations do not 
result in a definitive agreement.
- the Letter Agreement will not be drafted as an option (even though it will 
essentially operate as one), but instead will be a letter agreement for the 
purchase of turbines. Unfortunately, the semantics of this are both important 
to us and GE, but I believe it will be extremely difficult to do anything 
other than the form and semantics that GE wants (as we are competing with 
other buyers who do not have the same balance sheet constraints as us). As 
such, we may want to consider an interim OBS vehicle such as LJM if the 
looseness of the contract presents challenges for the TurboPark banks.

Lastly, given the somewhat tenuous nature of our queue position on the 
turbines, John strongly suggested that Delainey be immediately briefed, and 
that he call Dell as soon as possible based on the information John provided 
me in our conversation described above. He also suggested that we indicate to 
Dell that we have firm sites  (Florida and Longview) for the units. John told 
me that this latter point is important to GE as they are becoming fatigued by 
their other customers who have slues of turbines and not enough sites to 
accommodate them.

Let me know if you have any other questions. FYI, I put in a call to Lisa 
Bills on this deal, but have still not heard back from her.

Regards,

Ben

objections to the concept of the amendment.  However, I have not heard from
him since circulating the draft amendment.  I just left a voice mail for him
to get back to me with comments and will let you know.  (While writing this
e-mail, I received an e-mail from Doug Pedigo, and his comments are as
follows: "Seems to me you could combine paragraphs 2 and 3 and delete 4
through 7, but if this makes Enron comfortable, I guess I am OK with it.")
I will not make any revisions based on his comments unless you feel obliged
to do so.

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations,

option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.

Thanks,

Lisa,

The previous draft of the notice just mentioned the assignment and assumption 
agreement, so I went generic with closing docs.  Happy to list them 
individually, however.  I live off of lists.

Kay, in your letter you mention that a draft of the purchase agreement would 
follow.  You will need to provide the execution copies of the Purchase Option 
Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the Bill of Sale.  These should be 
noted in the Notice Letter.

As the letter is dated the 5th and I promised the bank the package of 
documents today for review (the release letter from the manufacturers being 
the one which will have the most comments), any e.t.a.?

Thanks, Lisa

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.

Thanks,

Kay

It happens to all of us!

I still have a bizillion roses in my yard.  I love them, and I don't baby 
them.  I figure if they die, I replace them, since they aren't that expensive.

I would love to include my friend Carlos Sole from EECC for my birthday lunch.

Kay

I only invited Dan and Sheila.  Dan has rsvpd yes, but I don't think Sheila 
has even had a chance to look at her emails.  Want to keep it just us?  Where 
would you like to go?  I'm going to put it on our calendars.  Would you like 
to invite Neil too?

Oh, I decided I'm going to start growing roses since mine have done so well.  
I'm going to put them in pots though (to start).  I like it that I can cut 
them and put them in vases in the house.  I have to have something to put in 
all the pretty vases I have.  I've ordered a Purple Chariot Miniature, Fairy 
Polyantha, Red Fairy Polyantha, Cancun Hybrid Tea Rose (this is gorgeous), 
and Yellow Magic Rose (for borders). Those hibiscus are pretty but they only 
last one day.  Uh oh, I'm turning into Mother!!!!!

Sounds good.  I prefer to keep it kind of small, if that's ok with you.

Thanks,

Kay

Dan and I (so far) would like to take you to lunch on your birthday.   I see 
you are free on your calendar, but I didn't know if you already have 
tentative plans.  Would you like to go?

I'm proof reading now.  I need a sanity check.  Does the GE acknowledgement 
look goofy?  Maybe I should set it up in a separate letter.  I lifted the 
language from the consent.

Through my discussions with Rebecca I have discovered the following:

1.  Regarding the transformer, the contract counterparty is "ABB Power T & D 
Company"

2.  The purchase price of the transformer ($786,000) was taken from the WLB 
financing book and does not include any of the capitalized interest charges 
or option payment (total $56,803) allocation that Global Finance has included 
in the calculation of the Payoff #.  The full cost of the transformer would 
be $842,803.

3.  The purchase price of each turbine ($14,072,000) was calculated as an 
average cost based upon a spreadsheet provided by GE.  This price does not 
include the $280,000 in change order costs allocated to each machine.  The 
full cost of each turbine should be $14,352,000.  The $280K in change order 
was picked up in the original payoff # prepared by Global Finance.

Ben has not yet reviewed any of the values in 2 or 3 above or the current 
payoff # determined by Global Finance.  I will talk with him first thing in 
the morning.  We will call you to confirm the correctness of these values.

Looks like your stuff.
Attached please find the Fountain Valley/GE Facility Agreement and
Exhibits, as well as blacklines (the first two documents) showing
changes from the form documents.

To complete each, we will need:

1. The contact information for Sections 6.7.2, 25.1 and 25.3 of the
Agreement.

2. Please have the business team confirm the Purchase Amount and
the Guaranteed Delivery Dates.  The information that I pulled off of the
spreadsheet that you provided (which is the information incorporated in
the Agreement) is inconsistent with the information that Alan Larsen
provided.

3. Do we want to use the Exhibit B-1 (Specification) from the
original West LB Agreement for this deal?

4. Do we need Exhibit R (Schedule of Witness Test Points)?

5.  Exhibit H will be attached prior to execution.

Hi there,

Thanks for taking my car in.  I admit I feel like men get treated better by 
car servicing people than women.  I'm not just saying that, either.

On the issue of Charlotte, is it your idea that she will take care of 
Tuesdays only while you are going to rodeo meetings?  I know in her email she 
had a preference for not doing the Sharon thing, and I do think we lost 
something when we (well, you) weren't communicating with Sharon or Amy in a 
regular basis.  I know it is easy for me to say since it is an inconvenience 
for you...

Please follow-up on the City of Austin change orders with Kay Mann.
karla.hesketh@us.abb.com on 12/18/2000 10:07:48 AM
Ben/Rebecca,

There are several changes which we have been asked to proceed with for which 
we
have not received contract change notices.

They are:

1)   Hauling and Installation of City of Austin Transformers (LNL9521-1 & -2)
$93,200.00.
2)   An additional crane for the City of Austin transformers (ABB S O Nos.
LNL9521-1 & -2) during the hauling and installation $9504.00.  Verbal OK from
Ben to Mike.
3)   A change authorized by D. Hammond/Enron to the Las Vegas Transformers
(LNL9518-1 & -2) including redesign costs, additional radiators and use of 
high
delivery fans.  $49,500.00 X 2 = $99,000.00.
4)   On 11/15/00 Mike Coleman advised ABB St. Louis to proceed on 
(modification
of the covers/bushing turrets for use at higher altitude) on the Fountain
Project Colorado transformers(LNL9518-1 -2 & -3).
We have not received a change order in the amount of $15,200.00 X 3 =
$45,600.00.

There is also one (Item 5 below) pending authorization to proceed.

5)   We await authorization to proceed and a change order from Ed 
Dannhaus/Enron
for the Fountain Project Colorado transformers (LNL9517-1-2 & -3) to proceed 
to
add 2 air terminal chambers to each of these transformers $19,500.00 per
transformers X 3 =  $58,500.00

Will these items be included in the facility agreement?

Please call if you need additional information regarding the above.

Regards,
Karla

FYI

Kay:

As far as I am concerned, the Escrow Agreements and the Fee Schedule are
ready for execution.  I would recommend at least 3 originals of each.  (At
one point, Lari Paradee and I discussed 5 originals of each - to correspond
with the 4 originals of the letter agreements plus one original for the
bank. Either 3 or 5 originals of each is fine with me.)  Thanks.

Hi Jeffrey,

I'm not handling change orders for the individual projects.  I'm checking 
with Stuart (he's the COA deal  lawyer) to get a consensus on the best way to 
handle this.

Please follow-up on the City of Austin change orders with Kay Mann.
karla.hesketh@us.abb.com on 12/18/2000 10:07:48 AM
Ben/Rebecca,

There are several changes which we have been asked to proceed with for which 
we
have not received contract change notices.

They are:

1)   Hauling and Installation of City of Austin Transformers (LNL9521-1 & -2)
$93,200.00.
2)   An additional crane for the City of Austin transformers (ABB S O Nos.
LNL9521-1 & -2) during the hauling and installation $9504.00.  Verbal OK from
Ben to Mike.
3)   A change authorized by D. Hammond/Enron to the Las Vegas Transformers
(LNL9518-1 & -2) including redesign costs, additional radiators and use of 
high
delivery fans.  $49,500.00 X 2 = $99,000.00.
4)   On 11/15/00 Mike Coleman advised ABB St. Louis to proceed on 
(modification
of the covers/bushing turrets for use at higher altitude) on the Fountain
Project Colorado transformers(LNL9518-1 -2 & -3).
We have not received a change order in the amount of $15,200.00 X 3 =
$45,600.00.

There is also one (Item 5 below) pending authorization to proceed.

5)   We await authorization to proceed and a change order from Ed 
Dannhaus/Enron
for the Fountain Project Colorado transformers (LNL9517-1-2 & -3) to proceed 
to
add 2 air terminal chambers to each of these transformers $19,500.00 per
transformers X 3 =  $58,500.00

Will these items be included in the facility agreement?

Please call if you need additional information regarding the above.

Regards,
Karla

Lisa,

Thanks.  I forwarded Roger the docs separately, but thanks for the reminder. 
I am capable of forgetting!

Kay,
1.  Finance will have comments to you this afternoon.
2.  I noticed just now that Roger Ondreko, as accounting signoff, was not 
copied.  Please insure he receives a set of agreements and comments timely so 
we can get the package out to the bank on the time line you require.

Thanks, Lisa

The GE facility agreements are nearing completion.  There will be facility 
agreements for Fountain Valley (aka PSCO) and for LV Co Gen.  The form is 
attached for your review.

In addition to the facility agreements, the parties will execute the override 
letters, in the form we developed last month.   Here is the override letter:

Please advise if there are any issues which need to be addressed.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached please find the Fountain Valley/GE Facility Agreement and
Exhibits, as well as blacklines (the first two documents) showing
changes from the form documents.

To complete each, we will need:

1. The contact information for Sections 6.7.2, 25.1 and 25.3 of the
Agreement.

2. Please have the business team confirm the Purchase Amount and
the Guaranteed Delivery Dates.  The information that I pulled off of the
spreadsheet that you provided (which is the information incorporated in
the Agreement) is inconsistent with the information that Alan Larsen
provided.

3. Do we want to use the Exhibit B-1 (Specification) from the
original West LB Agreement for this deal?

4. Do we need Exhibit R (Schedule of Witness Test Points)?

5.  Exhibit H will be attached prior to execution.

Attached please find our input on the conditions precedent for this agreement.
Also attached is a note that Greg Johnston sent concerning the Calumet 
agreement, some of which has been captured in the first attachment 
(recognizing that we can't hope to change too much, Greg and I went through 
this).   Concerning the note from Greg, please note that it contains some 
references to a contract on the Columbus set of turbines that we are also 
still evaluating.  We have a confidentiality agreement in place that covers 
employees of our affiliates.  Nevertheless, please do not distribute this 
note to anyone else.  Thanks  

Hi Dale,

Just got  your email re assignment out of TurboPark.  Here are the draft 
documents being reviewed by the lender for the movement of equipment out of 
TurboPark.

Attached please find drafts of the following:

Notice
Assignment and assumption agreement (with GE acknowledgement)
Bill of sale
Exhibits for bill of sale and for the notice

I expect that there will be sets of documents for CA Energy Development I and 
CA Energy Development II.  CA Energy Development II will include a 
transformer as well as a turbine generator set.

Please let me know if you have any comments.

Ben/Kay,
After reviewing the contract with Dave we found only a couple of points that 
we
would like to mention;
1) 1.48 the Maximum Liability Amount should be $768,000 USD
2) The unit will not be delivered until the last 10% (ten percent) retention 
is
paid and we will post the surety bond as shown in in Exhibit D
3) ABB would not buy back the unit except from Enron.

Please let me know if there is any way that we may further assist you.

Ben:

Substantive revisions were made (changing the earnest money concept to a
development fee concept, more complete termination provisions, replacing
confidentiality provisions with reference to a confidentiality agreement,
elimination of provisions addressing mediation) and the prototype documents
were recirculated on 12/15/2000.  However, the 12/15/2000 drafts of the
documents make specific references to NRG Thermal and contain specific dates
that would no longer be relevant.  We would recommend further revision to
address these matters before circulating for another potential transaction.

We have enclosed initial drafts of the following documents:

     1.   Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
turbine letter agreement with Coral);

     2.   Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean
copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of
the transformer letter agreement with Coral, and blacklined copy marked to
reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no.
1
above);

     3.   Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
LLC agreement for CA/ED-II).

As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the
representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where
necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron.
The
justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such
representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that
appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what
is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it
wants.  Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the
representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be
eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty.  Because we
rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a
more
clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur
purposes of reviewing representations and warranties.

Please review the enclosed at your convenience and advise of any comments.
Thank you.

Lunch is always good, but you could also just come for a visit any time he

ok.  I'll go look at the questions again.

I'll make the change.  In addition, I have not received responses to the
questions I presented in my cover e-mail accompanying the agreements
yesterday.  I would propose that we not distribute the agreement again
until these changes are incorporated.

Ben/Kay,
After reviewing the contract with Dave we found only a couple of points
that we
would like to mention;
1) 1.48 the Maximum Liability Amount should be $768,000 USD
2) The unit will not be delivered until the last 10% (ten percent)
retention is
paid and we will post the surety bond as shown in in Exhibit D
3) ABB would not buy back the unit except from Enron.

Please let me know if there is any way that we may further assist you.

MIKE

Please print two copies, put one in a folder.

Thanks,

Kay

We have enclosed the most recent drafts of the following "prototype"
documents:

1.  Letter Agreement for the turbine transaction;
2.  Letter Agreement for the transformer transaction
3.  Limited Liability Company Agreement fur the turbine/transformer
transaction.

These documents were last revised on 12/15/2000.  Since that time, we made a
number of changes to the letter agreement in the InterGen transaction that
you might also wish to consider for the prototype.  These items include (i)
provisions for submission and approval of the facility agreement, (ii)
requirement that the entire purchase price be funded into escrow upon
approval of the facility agreement, (iii) pro-ration of property taxes, (iv)
requirement for liability insurance through date of commercial operation,
and (v) tweaks in the termination language that would provide a right to
terminate, rather than automatic termination.  Let me know if we can be of
any assistance.  Thank you.

Yesterday, Mike Sandridge faxed me an addition to the spare parts listed

However, the information he provided does not show the expected purchase

I reviewed the GE Facility Agreement for CA Dev I and CA Dev II.

Section 6.1.2 of each Facility Agreement references the $1,829,000 payment 
which is required to be made on each turbine on or before 1/15/01.  This 
amount ties exactly to the amount shown in the most recent payoff calculation 
from Global Finance ($1,759,000 progress payment and $70,000 change order).

I am currently revising the Exhibits (1, 2a, 2b) for the Notice of excercise 
and the Bill of Sale to show the Purchase Amounts that correspond to the 
TurboPark payoff numbers.  I will forward those Exhibits to you shortly.

Where are we with regard to the escrow agreements and the amendment to the

Thanks,

I'm trying to get off the phone with you know who.  I'd better meet you 
downstairs or wherever we are going.

Kay

We need to change the alcohol and drug stuff.  Please call me to discuss 
tomorrow morning - I'll be in after 900.

Thanks,

Kay

Just wanted to let you know that I have a doctor's appointment at 3 pm
CST tomorrow.  It will probably last an hour. Chris Cobb ((202)
662-3016) will be available in my absence.

Do you want me to stick around any more tonight to make any additional
changes or just come in at 7 am CST tomorrow?

Sounds good to me.

We really need to get this amendment signed today.  Please do what you can to 
expedite.

Thanks,

Kay

Carolyn,

It has been brought to may attention that Section 3.2 of both of the
LLC Agreement forms that were initialed on December 27 incorrectly
states that SEL is a Delaware limited liability company rather than a
Delaware limited partnership.  Since the amendment letters purport to be
all inclusive, they should be further amended by inserting the following
sentence in an appropriate place in the two amendment letters for the
turbine generator sets:

"The Parties further agree that Section 3.2 of the LLC Agreement to
which reference is made in the Original Agreement will be amended as
appropriate to reflect that SEL is a Delaware limited partnership and
not a Delaware limited liability company."

George

Sure. 

The fix we want to make on the drug/alcohol policy is as follows:  instead of 
a reference to a specific numbered policy, the purchaser will provide ABB 
with a copy of their policy, and ABB will comply with it.

Kay

Can I release a preliminary draft to Alan?

Peter--I saw the breakout contract for the CA project that you sent out.
Could you send me the current draft, in whatever shape it's in, for the
Fountain Valley ABB contract?  I need whatever you have first thing

final
EPC contract price, not for dealing with GE or E-Next Generation LLC).

John,

Enron owns two GE 7EA turbines, which may be sold in a structure similiar to 
the CA Development structure.  We would like to update the letter agreements 
to address this possibility, and would appreciate K & S's assistance in that 
regard.  

The counterparties are not yet known, but I have heard Evista and Cayuga 
mentioned.

If this sounds good to you, I will initiate the approval process for your 
retention in this matter.

Thanks,

Kay

Team Turbineb,

Number one priority is the amendment to the two letter agreements.  We are 
also trying to get the ABB and GE facility agreements finalized so they can 
be tendered to Intergen today.  

Meanwhile, on the TurboPark front I am revising the relevant documents so the 
drafts can be sent to the banks today.  Once the assignment and assumption 
agreement form is approved, it will need to be signed by GE.  This doesn't 
have to be done today.

We are also trying to get both the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters signed 
today.

Carolyn, have the escrow agreements been fully executed?

Kay

Kay and Carolyn:

The proposed draft of the ABB Facility Agreement should be revised in
the following respects:

1.   The date of the Agreement on page one and the "Effective Date"
should be the date the Agreement is executed.

2.   Section 6.1.2 should be revised to read as follows:

Seventy-eight thousand six hundred dollars ($78,600) constitutes the
full and final payment for the Unit, except that Purchaser shall be
responsible for the payment of any and all amounts associated with any
Change Order approved after the Effective Date.  The final payment of
the Purchase Amount is subject to Section 6.1.3.

3.   The third and fourth sentences of Section 17.4.1 should be
amended to read as follows:

If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be due to Purchaser by Seller.  If the Maximum Liability Amount
(less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) is less than the Proper
Scope Value, the difference between such amount and the Proper Scope
Value shall be referred to as the "Scope Value Due."

InterGen is continuing to review the ABB Facility Agreement internally
and may have further revisions.

Seventy-eight thousand six hundred dollars ($78,600) constitutes the
full and final payment for the Unit, except that Purchaser shall be
responsible for the payment of any and all amounts associated with any
Change Order approved after the Effective Date.  The final payment of
the Purchase Amount is subject to Section 6.1.3.

3.         The third and fourth sentences of Section 17.4.1 should be
amended to read as follows:

If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be due to Purchaser by Seller.  If the Maximum Liability Amount
(less any unpaid portion of the Purchase Amount) is less than the Proper
Scope Value, the difference between such amount and the Proper Scope
Value shall be referred to as the "Scope Value Due."

InterGen is continuing to review the ABB Facility Agreement internally
and may have further revisions.

As you know, I just love to pile on. I took what I think are the latest form

No one is signing for CA Development today.

Ben or someone from the commercial team initials, not legal.  I just initial 
the signature.

   
	
	

1. Who is going to sign for CA Energy Development II, LLC and for ENA?

2. Do you want to initial all of the pages of the Facility Agreement?

Also, I need you to initial the docs where Enron is signing.

Please let me know about 1 & 2.

Kathleen

Please call todiscuss.
    
Attached please find a clean copy of the Enron South America Facility
Agreement as well as a blackline showing changes to section 6.1.2.

 <<ESA Break-out Agreement  Execution Copy.DOC>>  <<South America
Facility Agreement - Comparison of 9 to 10.DOC>> 

Here's an outline of what I was thinking of using. Obviously, there are huge 
holes in it, but I wanted to see if I'm on the right track.

Kay

Here's where I am:

Kay

Please call to discuss.
See attached.

Rose

I've sent JRigby the execution versions of the break out contract and the 
override letter.  I've asked him to call me to discuss.

FYI: The turbine contract was originally drafted by Brian Barto, then Kathy 
Clark took over.  Scott Dieball (EECC Legal) was actively involved in the 
negotiations, as was I. In facct, it was the first deal I worked on after I 
transferred to ENA from EECC.

Kay

No - he wants to see the breakout, but generally the commercial ts and cs are 
the same.  The breakout should be different only insofar as technical-type 
changes were made to accommodate a smaller "batch" of turbines and certain 
other site-specific changes.  The "override" letter contains the financing 
type changes that need to be in these "surrogate purchaser" deals.  The idea 
is that once the financing entities are out of the picture and we want to 
sell the facility, the breakout turbine purchase agreement can be assigned to 
the new owner without the funky "overrride letter" requirements.

Brett's question went to whether EECC would be critical of the commercial 
deal terms, because, oddly enough, EECC has historically been the point 
organization for all power asset purchases within Enron - whether the 
purchase was ultimately for an ENA, ESA or EECC/NEPCO project.  In this case, 
Brett can be assured that EECC had its input into the commercial terms last 
May, when Kay Mann (ENA power development lawyer) worked with Katherine Clark 
(an EECC contracts administrator) on the deal.

Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,

Rose

	Lisa Alfaro@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	01/05/2001 12:30 PM
		
So he doesn't want to see the breakout?  Only the original purchase agreement?

The ABB and GE agreements for CAED were signed by ABB and GE.  There was a 
revision to the ABB agreement (deleting irrelevant data sheets) that Kathleen 
Carnahan will send to you.

Thanks for all your work on these.  We are definitely making progress.

Kay

I can't believe we have a puppy.  Everything smells like puppy to me, even 
though I took a very long shower.  Michael and Pal had a nice visit this 
morning.  Pal is still whining a bit.  I brought one of our puppy books to 
the office, and I'll sneak a peak when I can.  I did read about the up at 
night stuff, and it says that so long as you don't let them get in bed with 
you, the whining should stop pretty quickly.  I hope the resting on the chest 
didn't mess it up, but boy, was I desperate.  He did great using the grass 
when we got up.  He definitely knows why we go outside.

Kaley picked on him a little, but she was at her food bowl.  I set up the 
little crate where she can't look in it, so he has an escape.  We should walk 
the perimeter to make sure there aren't any escape routes.  We probably need 
to protect the air conditioner wires until he is old enough to train to the 
electronic fence.

Thanks for taking the pig rat back. 

Love,

I don't remember seeing an agreement, which isn't to say that I haven't.

Barton Clark@ECT
01/08/2001 10:09 AM
As Rusty suggests, do you have a copy of an agreement between ENA ( or any 
affiliate thereof) and George Hessler re sound consulting services? I have 
been asked to put together an agreement between Hessler and Fort Pierce 
Repowering Project LLC, and don't know who Hessler is or what terms Hessler 
may have consulted under in the past. Rusty was not particularly helpful in 
this regard. I will call the consultant directly if we don't have something 
already available. Thanks.
	Rusty Stevens@ENRON
	01/05/2001 02:36 PM
		
Bruce was going to get the agreements signed - presumably by Ozzie since he 
is the the officer of the LLC that is closest to the deal.

I don't have the contract we use with George Hessler, but he has been used 
for numerous projects at Enron.  I think Kay Mann or Sheila would have a copy 
of his base agreement, and I'm not sure we ever did an amendment or whatever 
for this job.  

We can always call George and ask him for a copy of his agreement 
703-753-1602.

Barton Clark@ECT
01/05/2001 12:56 PM
One of the services agreements we discussed the other day that I needed to 
draft or review was the Hessler Sound Services agreement. Can you forward me 
what we have on that?

Also, we discussed the 4 agreements I initialled for signature that 
apparently were never signed, 2 with LBFH, 1 with Lucido, and 1 with ECT. The 
LBFH and Lucido had the counterparty's original signatures, and the LBFH were 
in duplicate originals. I understand this work has been kicked off, and we 
need to get something signed asap. Re the form of these agreements, I did not 
use the usual ENA forms because we were trying to put together something in 
a  hurry and we had the originals signed by the counterparties so we used an 
attachment to incorporate some essential terms. I would like to get the 
unsigned originals back to look over if they have not yet been signed, and if 
they have been signed, I would like copies. I have been requested to put 
together a file of all executed agreements by FPRP, or agreements proposed to 
be executed, and I did not keep copies of these four contracts.

This is the turbine contract for the 7EA's.

Kay,

Here is the electronic version of the Blue Dog Max contract.  Do I get any 
bonus points for this???

Chris
This should get you up to speed as far as available electronic docs can.

The DCMA states in 6.01 that notice can be given by the designee.  Karl 
thinks the notice must come from the DCM (ENA).  

Does it matter? I don't mind ENA giving the notice in this case, but I wanted 
to see what the team thinks.

To facilitate Enron's meeting the notice requirements under the Development

going to CAED II?

I believe this letter is applicable to the Blue Dog turbines:

Peter, 

I can't recall if I've sent you this override letter before.  Essentially, it 
is a letter which is in effect for as long as the equipment is owned by 
E-Next Generation, but which ceases to be effective once the equipment is 
assigned to a third party.   We will need something along the same line for 
the ABB equipment.  If you can send me a redline of the final form of the 
ABB  facility agreement against the master, we can discuss how to proceed.

Thanks,

Kay

Boyd,

I am not sure you have seen this agreement.  If you haven't, please give it a 
look for "fatal flaws", or information you think we need to be informed.

Thank you,

Kay
	
	

Kay - Sounds like Jeff is okay with the affiliate Master Purchase Sale 
Agreement from an Enron transactional point of view.  As this document will 
be filed with the ICC, I want to make sure that Boyd is agreement.  Assuming 
Boyd gives the all clear, we need to decide if we intend to file this right 
away or wait for the Hub Agency Agreement to be completed and make a joint 
filing.  However, I am cautiously optimistic that we are not too far apart on 
the Hub Agreement.  We had a commercial meeting yesterday and despite the 
obstacles presented by my supposed MEH partner, Roy, I think we made some 
headway.

Talk to you later,

Gregg

Hi Elizabeth,

I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset 
management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or 
purchase/sale of commodities.  A little birdie told me that you worked on 
something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go.  
When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.

Thanks,

Letter

My main comment is that the letter states that "ENA has received the 
requisite mangagement approvals required to execute" the TPA and pay the 
Order Commitment Payment and the 5% payment.  I cannot sign off on this 
because I do not have any evidence that ENA has received such approval - you 
should have an ENA lawyer sign off on the letter and the authorization 
requirements of the TPA.    My initials are for the review of the documents 
to ensure that they comport with the requirements of the financing documents 
only.

TPA

In Sections 1(c) and (d) - "month's" should be "months" - I believe in this 
case we need a plural, not a possessive.

Should have a semicolon at the end of Section 3(a)(2).   The last sentence of 
3(a) is a little garbled - maybe the phrase "must be met" should be deleted.

In Section 5(b)(4), I suggest you add the phrase "unless otherwise agreed by 
the Parties" at the end of the sentence.

I assume that the "Order Commitment Payment" is really an option payment - if 
it is not, it should be made clear that it can be credited against the 
termination payment.

Thanks,

Rose

closing and good general editing cleanup.  I would like to get this out to GE

The "MOU" consists of the GE proposal #80518 w/ offer letter of August 12,
1998, and J.M. Bollinger's (President, Cogen Tech) acceptance letter of
August 14, 1998.  These letters set the framework of the agreement,
including payment / termination schedule.  Invoicing & payments began in
September, 1998..and have continued on that basis until each of the
individual contracts for Linden & "Midwest" were consummated.  In Dec., 99,
at Enron's request,we allocated  funds paid to date to Linden and the "third
unit".  We'll forward copies of above.

Karl Siverling

The collective memory at ENA is that there wasn't an MOU per se, just the
assignment and assumption agreement.

Kay

jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com on 06/05/2000 03:51:46 PM

Brian,
I spoke to Karl today, and we tried to find the "MOU".  All we have found
was the "Assignment & Assumption Letter" you mention.
In that document, the Enron and GE entities were; Enron Capitol & Trade
Resources Corp. and General Electric Company, respectively.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

I have a copy of the "Assignment and Assumption Letter"  where GE agreed
that
Cogen Technologies could assign the rights to purchase the Units to Enron
Capital and Trade Resources, Corp.

The initials at the ECT signature block is Doug Pedigo's.

I have always been a little confused when Karl Siverling talks about
voiding
an
MOU, because I do not remember ever seeing an MOU for the Cogen Tech
units.

Perhaps we could ask Karl to send us a copy of the document he intends to
void
to make the process easier.

Hi Nancy,

We are still on for Thursday with VEPCO in Richmond.  I would like for you to 
participate.  In addition, we would like the opportunity to meet with you 
before hand.  We can meet late Wednesday afternoon in DC.  How does that 
sound to you?

I look forward to speaking with you soon,

You should have also received the original GE agreements and acknowledgement 
letters.  The transmittal letter has been signed and is being faxed to you 
and delivered.

As you may be aware, since our last report to you, the Illinois Pollution
Control Board has issued a report following hearings it conducted this
summer and fall concerning peaker power plants in Illinois.  The report
contains a number of recommendations to the Governor, including suggestions
that rules be adopted to require air quality studies and public hearings as
part of the permitting process, and that additional measures be taken as
part of the permitting process to insure compliance with Illinois' noise
regulations.  PMRW continues to monitor these developments.

Hi Lisa,

I'm back, and will finish up these docs this am.  The notice provision does 
not require that all the closing documents be completed as of the date of the 
notice, although I expect to have the package finished anyway, including the 
CA II documents.

We expect the escrow to be funded today, so as far as I know we will want to 
give notice today, although it might be later than the am, depending on when 
the escrow is funded.  Ben, Fred, are you ready for us to give notice?

Kay

PS.  Laurie Mahon says "hello".

Kay,
I see that the Notice is dated January 10th with a closing on January 18th.  
If you are not back to clean these documents revised and CA II completed 
until Wed am, I don't see how we can provide Notice on the am of January 
10th.  Also, is the 18th an absolute purchase date so Catherine can work with 
Ben to calculate how much money goes to TurboPark and how much we pay to GE?

Notice Ag:  Does "Confirmed by" mean the same thing as "Consented to" 
legally?  Would think so but CSFB wants us to Consent so let's make sure we 
have the strongest of the two language formations.

Assumption Ag: Pg 2, Clause 1:  insert ")" after Administrative Agent.
  Pg 2, Clause 3:  insert "and otherwise with respect to the Property" at the 
end of the last sentence.

Bill of Sale:  Last para:  Need to insert purchase date at end rather than 
"January 2001."
       Schedule 1:  Insert ")" after "Assigned Equipment".

Look forward to knowing the final notice and closing date.

Here's a set of CA I revised docs.  If these are ok, we will get CA II lined 
up as well.

 << File: Assumption with GE ack(CAEDI)rev2.DOC >>  << File: Bill of 
salerev2.DOC >>  << File: Purchase Option Notice(CAED I)rev2.doc >> 

I'm on the road tomorrow, but should be back in the office on Wednesday am.

Kay

I'm attaching the notices for CA I and CA II.  Please pay particular 
attention to CA II, since it is the first time it has been circulated.  
Obviously, we will need to insert the final purchase numbers.

Lisa, I set it up so ENA is consenting, which tracks the language in the DCMA.

Jerry Fox reports that Peoples has heard informally that the ICC Staff may
oppose the Master Sales proposal on the grounds that : (1) the approval of
transactions with an affiliate (without complete definition of all terms)
raises a potential for abuse; (2) staff perceives that it will be unable to
ensure that abuse does not occur; and (3) because the transactions under
the agreement are in a competitive market, the addition of enovate as one
more participant in the market with have little incremental effect on
Peoples' operation, i.e., enovate is just one more participant among the
many existing players. (Note that Peoples data responses seem to suggest
the view reflected in item 3.)  There is a status hearing at 11:00am today
which should cover only scheduling. It is unliokely that any substantive
position will be taken today. The schedule is likely to call for some
additional discovery followed by a filing date for staff's evidence abd
recommendation. Peoples will have an opportunity to file "rebuttal" to
staff's position.  I will let you know later what happens at the hearing.

Attached is an edited file for the ABB/Fountain Valley agreement. I have 
removed and made revisions to several sections to make it specific to the 3 
units for Fountain Valley. Specific revisions include:

Exhibit B1
- Page 23, revise quantity from 6 to 3
- Pages 43 through 86, delete pages specific to other designs

As noted in the forwarded e-mail, the contact information in Sections 25.1 
and 25.3 needs to be revised to replace Purchaser -

Question in Section 6.7.2 on Address for invoices - Is NEPCO the intended 
location for invoices?

Sounds good, but if today isn't a good day, it is not a problem.

I would like to have a chance to read it, which I haven't.  I still finishing 
up the Intergen docs.

The reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how GE is going to 
react, which might result in some changes to the contract.  In the case of 
the LM's we had already agreed with GE concerning the terms applicable to the 
equipment after assignment.

Fred,

As we discussed, we need the physical addresses where the equipment in 
TurboPark is being stored.  As I understand it the equipment is in at least a 
couple of places, and we haven't advised the banks of that fact.

Hi Nancy,

There are some comments on the VEPCO ppa from our regulatory side.  I was 
unclear if you had seen these before.

Kay
Christi L Nicolay@ECT
06/15/2000 05:41 PM
Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:
I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times 
there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency 
power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would 
want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to 
replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get 
this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  
I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.
Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting 
transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its 
network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have 
to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the 
plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to 
supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin 
Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's 
network transmission to delivery to third parties.
Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent 
rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While 
VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that 
you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to 
transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only 
way to ensure deliverability to third parties.
3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an 
increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other 
sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission 
and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on 
best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase 
daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of 
receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as 
non-firm.)
12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that 
has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since 
FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant 
changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining 
transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this 
contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price 
covers that circumstance.
Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at 
most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any 
current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will 
pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this 
contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.

Christi--

This is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively 
early draft of the PPA.

I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and 
do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  
IN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up 
the regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue 
less contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at 
Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  

Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their 
gas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas 
from the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the 
NCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think 
that we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply 
working on some of the siting issues.

That being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or 
Jeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there 
are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  

Thanks.

Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based 
on the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did 
encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are 
noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and 
are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this 
goes to VEPCO.

Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be 
ENA or a special purpose company?

Definitions--  We included a defined term "Emergency Start-Up" (a start up or 
increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to 
include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.

Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy 
charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?

Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD 
will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, 
it would be best to define "commencement of construction" to avoid 
controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a 
placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is 
your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific 
remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that 
milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would 
be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 
days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the 
cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?

Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under 
this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement 
to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the 
Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take 
1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be 
pro-rated for the first year?

Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of 
Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the 
total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated 
that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other 
than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled 
maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be 
available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated 
that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why 
wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we 
included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during 
peak periods.

Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of 
Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we 
allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?

Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.

Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?

Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not 
have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do 
you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for 
now?

Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or 
would you prefer a shorter period?

Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step 
prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is 
"baseball" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's 
position or the other's.  Is that what you want?

Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it 
will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not 
recommend Virginia law for this contract.

Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please 
see the bracketed notes therein.

Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.

Sounds great.  I'm starving also.

Ok, made the reservation for noon under Adams.  I'll leave Carlos a voice 
mail asking him to meet us there ok (since he has a meeting).  This all ok 
with you?

I love Vincent's and it is close, so I say we go for it.

So, should I make reservations?  Is there somewhere else you'd rather go?  
I'm starving!

I haven't talked to anyone.  I've got 10 docs going out this am, but I'm 
almost finished.

Sheila can't go today because of work.  Carlos called, is he still going?  
It's your birthday lunch, what do you want to do.

Sounds good, but if today isn't a good day, it is not a problem.

I still plan to be out on Friday - guess I should use my discretionary 
holiday first.

I should be in NYC Wednesday  and Thursday.  I don't need you to do anything 
in that regard yet.

Thanks,

Kay

The summary for the Las Vegas LM 6000 turbines is attached.  This reflects 
GE's final comments on the numbers (both performance and dollars), and is 
ready to deliver after attaching the following:

 (1)  I have overnighted to Ron's attention the 1" or so stack of exhibits 
from the master contract.  Pricing and spares have been deleted.
 (2)  The payment schedule for the 4 machines.  Kent Shoemaker said that Ben 
J. should have the payment schedule.

Bill:  The performance numbers have been changed from those in the master 
agreement to adjust for altitude and the decrease in water injection.  Please 
confirm that these are correct.

P.S.  Sheila is right--you just have to stay on these guys until you get what 
you want out of them.  Kind of like bull riding, I guess . . . .

 

I'll hang it up.

Kay

fyi
yes, I think this is part of it. Also, for that reason, Ron Jolle, attorney
for the City of Chicago attended the hearing today and indicated that the
City would intervene. One likely reason for the concern over potential
abuse is that, after a lengthy delay, I understand that the ICC has again
turned its attention to rules of conduct for gas utility affiliated
interests. They had started a proceeding to work rules, but there had been
no activity for many months. The ICC Staff has apparently been reviewing
rules of conduct in connection with resumed activity regarding the rules.
                                         At the hearing today, Jerry Fox
and Mary Klyshaff represented Peoples and North Shore. ICC was represented
by John Feeley and John RIeichart. Ron Jolle represented the City of
Chicago. David Gilbert is the Hearing Examiner. (He's a good examiner.)
There was no substantive discussion re issues. The schedule is: Feb.
28-Staff and Intervenor direct; March 28-Company rebuttal; Apr. 5-11:00am
status hearing (this was included in the schedule primarily to permit early
conclusion in the event that there are no issues raised or that the issues
are resolved);April 27- Staff/Intervenor  Rebuttal; May 11 Company
Surrebuttal; May 23 10:00am hearing.   If there are disputed issues, the
hearing would be followed by briefing, issuance of an Examiner's proposed
order and biriefs/replies on exceptions.

Lee,

The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy 
the Enron project folks you have been dealing with.  

Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?  I would think that we 
could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be 
whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.  The banks won't care.

Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?

Please confirm that this will be the invoicing address for the 6 units bound
for Fountain Valley Project and 4 units pegged to LV Cogen Expansion.  Also,
we've still got a change order needed for Fountain Valley for the 6 Power
System Stabilizers and 2 Exhaust Stacks.  LV is also saying they will need 4
Power System Stabilizers, but haven't confirmed their order.

Thanks,

It looks like things are moving forward on the Intergen/CA deal.  If we can 
verify the status of the wires we will want to give notice today.  Fred Mitro 
is working on this and will give you a call to up date the status.

I have not seen the final numbers to plug into the notices.  Is this 
information available?

Kay
Kay:
 
We have received by fax a new letter from SEL to ENA advising that all three
Facility Agreements delivered under ENA's January 8, 2001 letter are
acceptable to SEL, subject to the addition of Exhibit H-2 training materials
(omitted from the electronic version of the facility agreements) identical
to that inserted in the forms attached as exhibits to the turbine letter
agreements.  I will have copies of Exhibit H-2 made and inserted as
appropriate.  
 
The notice letter resolves all of the issues presented by the letter
previously tendered.  This new letter dated January 9, 2001 establishes
today, January 10, as the deadline for SEL funding the escrow, and Thursday,
January 18, 2001 (due to bank holiday on the 15th) as the closing date.
 
Fred just reported that Lari Paradee has advised that the three wire
transfers funding the escrows have been sent and that Citibank has confirmed
to her that the two $16.1 million wires have been received, with
confirmation on the transformer wire still pending.  She is to circulate
confirmation numbers as soon as available.  Enron may wish to independently
verify funding.

Hi Lisa,

Sounds good to me.

We will be sending unsigned docs, with signature pages to be provided later?

Kay

Kay,
Catherine and I have spoken with the bank about the Notice.  Please have all 
the paperwork ready to go by 10 am CST tomorrow other than the Purchase 
Amounts.  I will provide my last comments to the docs this afternoon if Rose 
will pls do the same.  Approx. 10:30 am CST, Catherine will provide you the 
three Purchase Amounts for insertion.  You will then need to send the package 
to Shazia at CSFB, as Admin Agent, by 11:00 am CST on Thursday, Jan 11th.  
The closing will occur on January 18th so long as our money makes it to the 
Payment Account (Fred and Ben, this is in your court to insure).

Sent by: Enron Announcements
It is with mixed emotions that I announce my plans to retire from Enron 
effective 1 February 2001.  On the one hand, I will look forward to the 
adventures that retirement offers; but on the other, I will miss working with 
those of you whom I have come to know over the years.  I thoroughly enjoyed 
my ten years with Enron, and it has been a privilege to lead EECC.  I wish 
all of you and Enron the very best and continued success.

The closing dinner for the big financing will be on Feb. 8.

Just thought I'd keep you current!

Love,

Al,

When I asked the question, I was told that the invoices needed to go to 
Jody.  If there's a desire for the invoices to go elsewhere, it will need to 
be addressed with Lisa Bills, with Roseann Engeldorf being consulted.   I do 
not know if the financing documents limit or otherwise specify the handling 
of invoices.

Hope this helps.

Kay

I haven't talked to Ozzie today.  When I spoke with him last night, we were 
arranging to meet in NYC next Wednesday, and I told him we could celebrate 
there.

I expect to be out of town Wednesday and Thursday of next week (don't worry, 
Ben can ALWAYS find me).  I would like to review the stuff before I leave 
town.  Could I come over Tuesday and give it a look?

Do you guys think we need or should give Intergen the assignment docs and the 
bills of sale?

I can probably get out around 600.  I could probably leave sooner, but I 
wouldn't get anywhere any quicker!

Sounds fine to me.

My vote would be to give George courtesy copies.

Kay:

Of course - please feel free to come over and review the documents.
Everything is organized in preparation for the closing.  When you have a
minute, can you please advise of any comments to the membership certificates
and promissory notes circulated by e-mail from me 01-03-2001 with subject
reference "Closing Documents".  Once I have your comments, I can circulate
these documents to George, and I presume he will prepare the form of
promissory note desired by SEL.  

In response to your question on delivering the assignment documents to
George, I am somewhat indifferent.  In some respects, I am inclined to
provide courtesy copies of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the
Bill of Sale to George, as I would want an opportunity to review these
documents if I were in his position.  On the other hand, he has not
indicated any desire to be in the loop on this aspect of the transaction,
and we do not necessarily want to invite additional comments.  I'm leaning
toward providing copies, but perhaps John has a stronger opinion.

Do you have any comments on the letter agreement for the 7EA turbine?  I
thought Ben wanted to get this out.  Let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Pete,

Please send a copy of the FV break out contracts to Sheila Tweed (Al works 
for her).  She needs the info this am, and doesn't want to wait until Al gets 
in.  She would also appreciate a list of the outstanding issues.

I'll talk to you in a bit on the ABB override letter.  I don't think there 
will be much to it.

Kay

Sheila,

Here's the latest I have, but there may be another turn in the works.  I've 
asked Pete to send it to you, along with the GE.  I need to do an override 
letter to pick up the agency stuff as well.  I spoke with Lisa about that 
yesterday.

Peter--I'm attempting to get you a revised Exhibit A.  I'll confirm with Kay 
whether we need Jody Pierce as designated recipient of invoices, or whether 
we can have them sent to NEPCo so long as they go to Jody for payment.  There 
is no comma before the LLC after E-Next Generation. Is there any other info 
you need on the ABB breakout? We want to be able to execute it as soon as we 
get you this info.  Thanks.
 Al Larsen

These changes have been made.  To complete this agreement, we need (a) a
revised Exhibit A, (b)the response to the Don Hamond's question re.
Section 6.7.2 and (c) confirmation of whether it is "E-Next Generation,
L.L.C." or "E-Next Generation LLC".

Here is the FVP-specific info for the ABB breakout contract.

Attached is an edited file for the ABB/Fountain Valley agreement. I have
removed and made revisions to several sections to make it specific to
the 3
units for Fountain Valley. Specific revisions include:

Exhibit B1
- Page 23, revise quantity from 6 to 3
- Pages 43 through 86, delete pages specific to other designs

As noted in the forwarded e-mail, the contact information in Sections
25.1
and 25.3 needs to be revised to replace Purchaser -

Neil left to go hunting this am, Paige leaves for school tomorrow, leaving 
me, Michael and our new puppy (mid life crisis dog) to our own devices.  I'm 
taking the day off tomorrow, and Monday is an Enron holiday, so I'm looking 
forward to some Kay time, working in the yard (weather permitting), watching 
Oprah, etc.

Boys............whatcha gonna do?
They love that stuff.........
Missy, our friend Susie, and I went to the usual Elvis
impersonator thing at Chuy's on Richmond Monday night.
Walked into a full force cat fight on the way in...one
girl screaming Lesbian at the top of her lungs, and
dropping the "C" bomb all over the girl she was
beating up. Waiters had to get them out of the place
and into the parking lot.  Very exciting. 
Dinner with family and Dad's widowed friend Claude,
and his daughter Lisa who we have known forever.  Good
folks.
Any plans for you?

Hi there,

I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for 
GE's acknowledgement.  It is pretty close to what you saw last week.  It 
would be a big help if we could have these executed  by GE today or 
tomorrow.  A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals 
picked up from Lee's office.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached are electronic versions of the final docs for the CA Development 
transactions. If there are no other comments we will get the Enron 
signatures.  How many originals are needed?

Noticed was faxed to the Admin Agent this am.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Here's what I have on H-2.  Sorry Pete, I thought I had sent it to you 
previously.

Kay
lee.johnson@ss.ps.ge.com on 12/21/2000 04:25:08 PM
I'm forwarding this per my conversion with John Ayres as the Training insert
H-2

FYI.

I have reviewed the below document provided by Kay Mann.  While I realize the 
Chicago team is trying to proceed in an expeditious manner, there are 
concerns within the document which affect the financing and accounting 
treatment of Canada's Project Moore.  The items discussed below are focused 
on the 2 ABB turbines Enron Canada is interested in potentially acquiring.

From an accounting perspective (Herman and Roger, please correct me where I 
misstate something we talked about this afternoon):

 *  Any payment amount provided to PERC from an Enron entity must be in the 
form of an option premium.  If an Enron entity were to make any other type of 
payment to PERC associated with the purchase of the turbines, it would be 
considered a hard cost and the turbines would be put on Enron's balance 
sheet.  Once there, they could not be used in Project Moore since that 
Project must be kept off balance sheet.

 *  Enron Canada cannot just step into PERC's shoes under the WestLB 
Documents and Turbine Contract.  These documents were entered into at the 
beginning of 2000 and approved by PERC's accountants.  The AA team for Enron 
has been reviewing a considerable number of both sets of documents and the 
required language has changed quite a bit on both from early 2000.  
Therefore, both the WestLB Documents and the Turbine Contract will need to be 
amended to receive AA's approval to keep the turbines off Enron's balance 
sheet.

From a financing perspective:

 *  We are currently working at providing a Canadian lease structure for 
Project Moore.  From a cost perspective it would be best to wait until the 
structure is in place and have it purchase the turbines from WestLB/PERC.  
Without the DASH approved, the turbines will not be able to be purchased, no 
matter the Purchaser.  From the latest information I have, it appears that 
the DASH is scheduled to be presented to the Board approx. Aug 7th.  The 
Canadian structure should be ready shortly thereafter.  If there is a timing 
differential, our existing WestLB facility for Project Moore can be expanded 
to house the PERC turbines along with the existing N1s until the Canadian 
vehicle is ready.  This will be more expensive for Enron Canada than waiting 
until the Canadian vehicle is in place to purchase the PERC turbines since 
there will be two upfront "structuring" fees to be paid by Enron Canada.  
Given that the WestLB documents with Enron have already been negotiated and 
approved by AA, this appears to be a better alternative than "stepping into" 
PERC's shoes under their WestLB Documents and negotiating everything again.  
As for the Turbine Contract, it will need to be modified regardless of who 
the Purchaser is - WestLB or the Canadian vehicle.

 *  I realize PERC would like to keep all the potential deals wrapped 
together since they all involve Calumet Power LLC.  However, given the 
requirements for keeping the PERC turbines off Enron's balance sheet, it 
would seem to be cleaner for these turbines to be carved out and have Enron 
Canada enter into a separate Option Agreement with PERC, subject to 
satisfaction of conditions precedent, for the potential purchase of the 
turbines.  We have entered into several option agreements with vendors 
recently so the documentation is pretty standard and can be approved by AA 
quickly.  Although PERC would like a firm commitment from Enron, this will be 
difficult without the DASH being approved.   At the same time, PERC and ENA 
can continue to negotiate a contract for the rest of the potential 
transactions.

As for the rest of the Assignment and Option Agreement, I apologize for being 
out of the loop but would someone please update me on how you see these 
transactions being financed.  I want to insure that Finance and Accounting 
are up to speed with these transactions so that if ENA does move forward, it 
is a smooth process and balance sheet favorable.

I look forward to working with the team on finalizing the agreement(s) for 
PERC's review on Monday.

   

Here's where I am:

Kay

I think you can just include the electronc file and the appropriate person 
can print it off when they print the Word file with the rest of the 
contract.  I don't have any better idea than that.

Kay

Suz,

Please print four sets of originals of each of the documents you faxed this 
am (name in footers).  

Thanks,

Kay

I haven't seen the originals.  I can send you an email which has the name of 
the files, but I do need them printed so that the footer appears with the 
name as opposed to the temp file number.

Thanks!

Kay

I told them to bring the originals back to you because I thought you needed 
them.  Do you have them so I can come get them and do this for you.

Carolyn,

On the insurance, I would prefer that we go with set insurance requirements, 
$10m in coverage (without aggregate), deductible no greater than $25,000 for 
which they are responsible.  We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better. 
Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be 
responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine 
contract.  The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at 
closing.

Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them 
on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table? 

Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days 
after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something 
they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but 
we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it.  
Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the 
indemnities lasting longer.

I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2  years in this deal.

I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the 
facility agreement.

14.  I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the 
equipment is being acquired from ENA.  I would also eliminate "or any other 
third party" on the fifth line.

Defined terms:  "Commercial operations" isn't in the definitions of the 
turbine contract, although there may be a definition imbedded in their 
somewhere (an EECC specialty).  Please verify.

Do we intend to attach a form LLC agreement?

Thanks,

Kay

I just sent my comments to you and Carolyn.

I would like to have a chance to read it, which I haven't.  I still finishing 
up the Intergen docs.

The reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how GE is going to 
react, which might result in some changes to the contract.  In the case of 
the LM's we had already agreed with GE concerning the terms applicable to the 
equipment after assignment.

Is there any reason we would attach a summary of the master 7EA facility 
agreement rather than a redacted copy? Other than that, it looks good to me. 
Are you OK with us sending this out?

Also, it would be helpful to have all exhibits to send with the letter (i.e., 
LLC Agreement, Facility Agreement summary, escrow agreement, etc.) Please let 
me know the status of these.

Thanks,

Ben

Enclosed is a revised draft of the proposed letter agreement for the 7EA
turbines reflecting Ben's business points and the matters discussed in our
telephone conference earlier today.  Also enclosed is a blacklined copy
reflecting revisions from the December 15, 2000 draft of the prototype
letter agreement.  Although we have enclosed a blacklined draft reflecting
revisions from the final draft of the CA/ED-I letter agreement, this is
difficult to read due to our re-arrangement of the reps and warranties.  If
you have any questions or comments, please advise.  (I have received the
courier package with the GE Facility Agreements).

Bodie.  I like Bodie.  Here Bodie, you a goooood booy Bodie.  I'M NOT 
KIDDING!!!!

I'd go with Bubba, but that's what we call our cat.

Pete,

I have a question.  Is it necessary for the amount of consideration to be 
listed in the final lien form (exhibit R or S, something like that)?  If so, 
what amount goes in there?  Will this defeat what we are trying to do in 
keeping the original price a supposed mystery?

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is the GE override letter to accompany the facility agreements. 

I'm trying to figure out the ABB form.

Kay

I would think that the  LOC's for #s 2 and 3 should be for CA Energy 
Development I and CA Energy Development II, since we will close on those 
transfers next week.

ckm

The accounting group received a set of 3 faxes from GE with information on 
Letters of Credit issued by GE with E-Next Generation as the beneficiary.  
These documents need to be countersigned and I don't know if anything else is 
required to "activate" the LOCs.  I'll fax copies to you all.
The documents are:
LOC 1: $4,289,200  (for the 6 Fountain Valley turbines, since the amount is 
5% of the total turbine cost)
LOC 2: $717,600  (for Intergen turbine 1)
LOC 3: $717,600 (for Intergen turbine 2)

This is in accordance with the LM6000 purchase agreement (Section 6.1.3) 
where GE must provide Retention Letters of Credit (the Retention Amount is 5% 
of the purchase price) when E-Next Generation pays GE the final progress 
payment (this final payment is scheduled to go out on 1/16/01).

The LOC docs need to be counter-signed within 30 days and then forwarded to 
the E-Next Generation, since they are the beneficiary.

I see your point that the put should be higher up on the list.  In my 
opinion, this will be the biggest issue with ABB. 

I think the put to ABB should be at $3 MM US and the term 6 months from 
agreement execution, as a first cut.  Let's put this higher in the list 
(right after the cost items).
The "law" items probably need cleaning up as you suggest Kay - the first 
dealt with overall Cdn laws and statutes, the second to specs and standards 
and local laws.
The force majeure item (11) should just say that costs for handling through 
storage due to FM shall be at the cost of Seller, if Seller is claiming 
party. 

	
	

I've made a rough stab at an exhibit to capture the changes which are 
necessary for the ABB contract.  Please comment on the attached, suggest 
changes, etc.  

I will add a rep. or condition about receiving all the change orders, etc, 

FYI, I will be working on this over the weekend, should you care to comment.

Kay

The practice has been for someone from Enron familiar with the project (not a 
lawyer) initials each of the pages for both contracts, inlcuding exhibits.  
So, we need to make arrangements for that to happen.  Each of GE and ABB do 
likewise.  So, who is the lucky person for your project?

Kay

Kay--Would you like us to get you signature pages (for the GE and ABB 
breakout contracts) on behalf of ENA from here, or is it more efficient or 
uniform if you get a signature there before getting them to GE and ABB?  
Sheila needs the fully executed agreements for TurboPark, so let me know.

Attached is the GE override letter to accompany the facility agreements. 

I'm trying to figure out the ABB form.

Kay

It doesn't need to be a VP.  It was a function previously performed by EECC 
contracts people.  Ben initialled on the Intergen form, and John Ayers (I 
think a develop engineer) initialled for ESA.

I'm off on a day of vacation this am (the Enron kind), so I picked up email 
early.

Kay

If you need a VP , Jake Thomas.  Otherwise, Jeff Slaughter.  FYI, I'm getting 
the "disconnect" on the heat rate guarantee evaluated this morning.  You 
certainly are up early this morning..

Hi Kathleen,

I left a stack of initialled docs on the appointed chair in my office.  If 
you will email me Janet's telephone number, I will call and leave a voice 
mail about you bringing her the docs to sign.

Thanks,

Kay

I agree.  Please revise the form accordingly.

Thanks,

Kay

I have reviewed both the ABB and GE Agreements and have spoken to Paul
about this issue.  I do not believe it is necessary for the amount of
consideration to be listed in the final lien form. I believe that ABB
and GE can simply acknowledge that Seller has been paid in full or that
Purchaser has paid all sums owing to Seller under the agreement, or
similar language.

Fred and Rebecca should be talking to Accounting about this. Do you want me 
to respond to your email and copy them?

ckm

Have you talked to Karl yet?  Do you mind calling him?

Thanks,

Kay

I think your suggestion about the effective date was quite logical, but it 
seems to me that it is more of a Sweetgum issue than ours.  Unless you think 
we have a problem, I'm ok with going along with George on this.

I presume the original LLC agreement  allows for either the Member to sign or 
an Officer of the LLC.  I also assume that Janet Dietrich is an officer of 
both CA's.  Therefore, I'm fine with your suggestion. 

Kay

Kay:
 
George has prepared a promissory note to be executed by the LLC payable to
SEL but has not received comments from Doug on this yet.  I requested that
he get that to us in order that we might include it in the package out to
you later today.
 
With regard to the date in the LLC Agreement, George proposed that we delete
altogether the "effective date" paragraph set forth in Section 2.5.  He is
reluctant to provide an effective date of midnight after the closing date,
as he thinks all of the documents should be effective simultaneously.  I am
okay with this.  What do you think?
 
Per your request, we have prepared LLC certificates using the pre-printed
share certificate forms in the minute book.   These pre-printed forms
provide that the share certificates are to be signed by the "member."  We
typically see share certificates signed by designated officers of the LLC.
Unless you instruct otherwise, we will strike through the word "member"
beneath the signature line on the share certificate in order that an LLC
officer can sign.  
 
Please advise of any comments on the promissory note to be executed by the
LLC payable to ENA.  Thanks.

out from Janet's comment that I did not get Ben's initials on the documents.

work on for Stuart.  I think I will go by Hebert's on the way home!

K-

I think we will be staying in Richmond.  At least that was the plan as of 
Friday afternoon.

Heather Kroll will be meeting with us.

Kay

That will be fine.  I'll reserve a conference room--just let me know when to 
expect you.  Our office is at 2000 K St, N.W., Suite 500.  Do you need any 
help with hotel reservations?

Hi Nancy,

We are still on for Thursday with VEPCO in Richmond.  I would like for you
to participate.  In addition, we would like the opportunity to meet with
you before hand.  We can meet late Wednesday afternoon in DC.  How does
that sound to you?

I look forward to speaking with you soon,

Kay

Ok, I'm out of it.  Where's she going?

Please do what you can to find out what is going on. I know you forwarded 
these to Carolyn, but I would still appreciate it if you could investigate, 
or ask Carolyn to do so.

Kay: We recently received payment of our June, 2000 invoice. Previously, we
had received payment of the September, 2000 invoice. This leaves
outstanding the invoices for July, 2000 (30492348; $9,810.19); August, 2000
(30502885; $3273.75); October, 2000 (30526950; $1819.73), November, 2000
(30539817; $1510.45); and December, 2000 ($1675.29). At the request of your
assistant, I forward the information re the invoices through November to
the Enron accounts payable help desk, but I did not hear back. Anything you
can do to expedite payment of theses invoices would be appreciated.

Hi Elizabeth,

Congratulations on your promotion!!!!!

Unless someone else volunteers, I guess I'll do the ABB override letter.  
I've mentioned it to Pete Thompson, but he is in our offices today, so he 
can't do it.  Rob Taylor did the initial draft of the GE version, but Rose 
finished it, with a bit of help from me.  It should be a fairly short letter.

ckm

Kay, Al has called Peter to redline the execution drafts against the master 
contact, whether or not that's the last  draft that Lee has looked at.  
Actually Al doesn't believe that Lee as seen any draft of the breakout 
contract for Fountain Valley.  The banks need to see it redlined against the 
Master contract.  Also, who do I call to get the ABB override agreement?  We 
are trying to get signoff first thing Tuesday am so that E-Next can sign 
these before we do the rest of Fountain Valley.  So all of the breakout 
contracts (GE and ABB) and their respective override contracts need to be 
finalized and executed pronto. I'm leaving voicemails with Lee and Kent.  
Would you check with ABB?  Is it Mike Sandridge?

This is where I will be this afternoon.

Kathleen,

There were three original assignment and assumption agreements:  One of CAED 
I (GE) and two for CAED II (one for GE, one for ABB).  I only see two in my 
packet, and only two are referenced in the transmittal letter.  HELP!!!!!!!!  
This is obviously urgent.

Kay

I thought that someone retrieved the originals (which has been signed by GE 
but not Enron) while I was in Ft. Worth for my dad's surgery. Marty mentioned 
that you were looking for them, so I thought  he had given them to you (he's 
out this week).  I have not seen the termination agreement since I returned. 
Did you and John leave fully executed termination agreements in my office?  
Maybe someone else picked them up.  

I can't tell you what's going on with the assignment.  Perhaps Peggy Banczak 
can help out with that.

Kay

Brian D Barto@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
07/17/2000 08:00 AM
Schroeder and I left two signed originals with you, so what does "processed" 
mean.  Yes, thankyou for asking, GE has received their fully executed 
original, and therefore should be prepared to issue the invoice to 
Purchaser.  But I have not seen the invoice yet.

What is the status of the assignment of the GE contract to Mitsui?  Did the 
invoice go to them?

I haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk.  I 
just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed.

Thanks,

Kay

I'm thinking that the 1st paragraph of the GE override letter needs 
massaging, since it refers to the master agreement.  I'll be glad to do it 
when I can, but I'm knee deep in the ABB agreement at this point.

Kay

The Intergen LOC should be in CAED I and CAED II's names, issued after 
closing on the 18th.

The PSCO deal team should handle the PSCO LOC, which should be in the name of 
the PSCO project company, I think, after that deal closes this week.  Al 
Larsen and Sheila Tweed can address these.

Hope this helps.

Kay

   
	
	

Kay

In the letters of credit from GE for the PSCO and Intergen turbines, it 
states that the beneficiary must countersign the three documents within 30 
days of 1/10/01.  The beneficiary is listed as:

E-Next Generation, L.L.C.
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002.  

Does this mean that  the documents need to be signed by someone from ENA and 
then forwarded to E-Next Generation or just sent straight to E-Next 
Generation?  Also, does anything else need to be done to "activate" the 
Letter of Credit?  It appears from the documents that nothing else would need 
to be done unless it were necessary to draw on the account for some reason.  

Please advise on who needs to sign the three documents and if any other steps 
need to be taken in regards to them.

Thanks,
Rebecca    
	
	

Sent by: Ben Jacoby@ECT
Fred / Rebecca:

Please follow up on this with Kay. Thanks.

Ben
The accounting group received a set of 3 faxes from GE with information on 
Letters of Credit issued by GE with E-Next Generation as the beneficiary.  
These documents need to be countersigned and I don't know if anything else is 
required to "activate" the LOCs.  I'll fax copies to you all.
The documents are:
LOC 1: $4,289,200  (for the 6 Fountain Valley turbines, since the amount is 
5% of the total turbine cost)
LOC 2: $717,600  (for Intergen turbine 1)
LOC 3: $717,600 (for Intergen turbine 2)

This is in accordance with the LM6000 purchase agreement (Section 6.1.3) 
where GE must provide Retention Letters of Credit (the Retention Amount is 5% 
of the purchase price) when E-Next Generation pays GE the final progress 
payment (this final payment is scheduled to go out on 1/16/01).

The LOC docs need to be counter-signed within 30 days and then forwarded to 
the E-Next Generation, since they are the beneficiary. 

-Catherine
x3-9943

Here's my stab at it:

I'll be in an off site the rest of the day.  I have no pride of authorship.  

I'm unclear which entity will be signing the agreements, so I've left some 
[]'s.

GE posts an LOC in lieu of retainage.

What is this for?  The project entity for PSCO is Fountain Valley Power, 
L.L.C.

Please cancel the hotel.  I suspect the whole trip will cancel, but I don't 
want to give up the flights yet.

Kay

Hi.

My trip was postponed until next week.

There's a happy hour (official/formal) for my client groups.  It would 
probably be a good idea for me to stop by, but it isn't mandatory.

FYI.  Seems like this is something you should ok.

Here is the revised, and final form, of the ABB override letter for use in 
conjunction with the FVP breakout contract for FVP.

Al,

If the transformer contract will be assigned later to a wholly owned sub of 
E-Next (aka the project company) it would seem that the Transfer Date should 
probably be redefined to reference an assignment to an unaffiliated company.  
Same thought on the GE override.  This is because the override will still be 
in effect if E-Next owns the equity in the assignee.

At the end of the day, we've got $25 million in a CT without a generator. ENA 
will get saddled with these costs if we do not find a resolution either 
through a buyer or a settlement with SW.

I really hope we can focus on this in the next couple of days. FYI, both 
Chris Booth and Ron Tapscott have been drafted on this effort. 

Thanks,

Please attend a meeting at 1:00 PM on Wednesday, 17 January 2001 in EB3143c 
to discuss the latest status of the Westinghouse 501D5A Generator set.

Please let me know ASAP if you are unable to attend.

Thanks,

Chris Booth

I feel fairly confident that you received change orders 1-4.  If not, please 
advise.  One of those change orders changed the delivery dates for the LV Co 
Gen equipment.

The Guaranteed Delivery Dates in Section 10.2.1 were taken from the
original agreement.  I am not aware of any change order modifying those
dates.

I'm reviewing.  Are dates in Section 10.2.1 correct?  Lee, I'll forward
you
my comments separately.

At the request of Peter Thompson, attached is the blacklines of the
GE/Facility Agreement showing changes from the Original Form Agreements
and the Execution copy.  Peter will be out of office today, therefore,
please contact Chris Cobb at (202) 662-3016 if you have any questions. 

 <<Comparison of GE Facility Agmt with Original Form Agreement.DOC>> 

Here's the latest from GE.

When I spoke to Rob Stevens, he had a question about whether Mitsui needed to 
review the final drafts of the GE agreements. I don't know the resolution of 
that issue.

As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days 
of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the 
contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui 
can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.  Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui 
bought in on the payment plan?

I do not know the status of the tax issues raised by Jeff. I would also like 
to make sure that Jeff agrees with the mechanism of superseding the prior 
agreement with GE.  

Kay

jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com on 06/06/2000 09:47:54 AM
Kay,
I'm faxing to you the documents highlighted in RED, below.
So, it looks like we need to supercede these documents, along with the
assignment and assumption agreement. 
I believe the entities I mentioned yesterday are still applicable.  
If you have a different opinion, let me know.
Give me a call at 518-385-7722, and let's get the documents in condition to
be signed today or tomorrow.

The "MOU" consists of the GE proposal #80518 w/ offer letter of August 12,
1998, and J.M. Bollinger's (President, Cogen Tech) acceptance letter of
August 14, 1998.  These letters set the framework of the agreement,
including payment / termination schedule.  Invoicing & payments began in
September, 1998..and have continued on that basis until each of the
individual contracts for Linden & "Midwest" were consummated.  In Dec., 99,
at Enron's request,we allocated  funds paid to date to Linden and the "third
unit".  We'll forward copies of above.
Karl Siverling
The collective memory at ENA is that there wasn't an MOU per se, just the
assignment and assumption agreement.

I spoke to Karl today, and we tried to find the "MOU".  All we have found
was the "Assignment & Assumption Letter" you mention.  In that document, the
Enron and GE entities were; Enron Capitol & Trade Resources Corp. and
General Electric Company, respectively.

Jeff Smith

Mom was asking my about cake, and I don't know what is on the menu for 
dessert.  Guess we can ask for cake.  Neil thought we should have cake at the 
PH.  Guess that makes sense, too.

You want to coordinate on when to get there? That may be too out of character 
for all of us, but we can aspire to organization.

It is hot here, too.  The wind in the afternoon is really oppressive.  Dry 
heat - HA!  It is still darn hot.

I cringe at the thought of Six Flags.  I'm sure Paige can be bought.  She 
went recently and had a big time.

Hope your week is quiet.

Love/hugs, etc, to all,

Kay

Hi!

We are back from Six Flags. I don't know what it is about us, but we always
seem to end up in Theme Parks when the temperature is over 103. We call that
Crowd Bustin' Temps! We had a great time and we are completely exhausted.
The girls are getting ready for bed without even complaining. It was fun to
go, but if I were you I would hire Paige to take Michael there! It has
changed since we were kids, but it is really a teenage heaven -- I think
there are like 8 HUGE roller coasters. Did you know that it isn't fun
getting nauseated anymore?? Pink Things still taste great and the Gunslinger
Show is still funny!

We didn't really see much of mom and dad until today. It was nice chatting
with them. I can tell that Mama is getting a little bit of cabin fever.
Tomorrow she starts her exercise class and she's going out for lunch. When I
called her when we got home she said that Daddy's leg was feeling much
better. I could tell that the knee incident on Friday really upset them
both. I think they were afraid that it wouldn't get better. But, it seems
like it is better now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Mother is really looking forward to the surprise birthday. We gave dad a
copy of the movie My Dog Skip for his present while we were there, complete
with his birthday card. (Just to muddy the water a bit!)

Now, let me see if I can remember the things Mama wanted me to tell you. I
know that she wanted me to tell you that she won't be able to stock up on
soft drinks, juice or other things like that since it would make Daddy
suspicious. I'll probably bring Pop Tarts for the kids breakfast on Sunday.
Plus drinks and juice.  Also, do you know if we will be having birthday cake
for desert? If not, let me know and I can always bring one. I'll bring Bud
and wine and kid drinks. Anything else?

I can't believe we were able to go and visit and not spill the beans. That's
pretty good for us!

I wish we were still on "vacation", but I guess you have to come back to the
real world sometime. When we got home we had phone messages from Bobby's
sister and aunt and a note from his dad. I think I'll wait and talk to them
tomorrow. They take a lot of energy you know!

Tell your family hello for me. We are all looking forward to seeing you guys
at the pink house!

Love you!

Lisa

sorry

Here is the Change Order number 4 that I should have sent out earlier.
Lee,
stated on the phone call today that there may be additional comments, so
please reply to all if there are so we can revise the Facility Agreements
accordingly.

Kent

Didn't I tell you - I love outside counsel!!!

See you tomorrow
Kent

CST.  That was right, right?

I'm going to have the outside lawyer involved for the purpose of turning
the revised draft, so long as you don't have an objection
(objecting=volunteering to turning the next draft!)

Kay

Is that 3:30 CST? If so, I'll be ready.

Gentlemen:

Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB.
It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.

It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me
otherwise.  I'll get back to you with the location.

Kay
Enclosed please find clean and blacklined versions of the GE Contract.
The blackline of the Agreement identifies the changes from the draft I
sent you. Note that no blackline of the Exhibits was necessary because
it contained no references to WestLB.

At the end of the day, we've got $25 million in a CT without a generator. ENA 
will get saddled with these costs if we do not find a resolution either 
through a buyer or a settlement with SW.

I really hope we can focus on this in the next couple of days. FYI, both 
Chris Booth and Ron Tapscott have been drafted on this effort.

Please attend a meeting at 1:00 PM on Wednesday, 17 January 2001 in EB3143c

Pete,

I'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by NEPCO/EECC (our 
affiliate).  From what he has sent me, it does not seem that the Fountain 
Valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for plants 
comprised of 6 or more units.  It would seem to be applicable in this case.  
Was it deleted intentionally?

Thanks,

Kay

At the request of Peter Thompson, attached are the blacklines of the
ABB/Facility Agreement and GE/Facility Agreement showing changes from
the Original Form Agreements and the Execution copies sent to you on
Friday, January 12th. Peter will be out of office today, therefore,
please contact Chris Cobb at (202) 662-3016 if you have any questions.

    Al, you also mentioned January 3rd. as the date Peter was looking
for the Agreements.  If this is correct, could you let Chris Cobb know
and specify whether that is to be the effective date.

Enron is entitled to an additional output guarantee when we have 6 or more 
units installed in a facility.  Peter missed the point, and I didn't catch it 
because I really didn't look at FV very closely at all.   Rigby caught it.  
He disagrees with how we massaged his original language for this additional 
guarantee, and I will try to figure out his point.

No.  I apologize. I do not know why it was deleted.

We really need to get on top of the situation with the 501D5A. I believe SW 
is now taking the position that the generator was delivered under the terms 
of the contract, and risk of loss resided with us at the time of the "event". 
I furthermore understand they are taking the position that if we want a 
replacement generator, that we need to execute a change order. Kind of makes 
you feel like you're getting squeezed...

Thanks. Gregg sent this over on Friday.  I will get back to you by tomorrow
with any comments.

Just wanted to confirm that we are moving ahead for the Intergen closings.  

Lisa, I spoke with Karl, and he has promised to let me know if there any 
hitches on their end.  His preliminary assessment was that everything was ok, 
but he wants to check.

Ben, Kathleen will be bringing the documents to you to initial this 
afternoon, then I will sign off so Janet can execute the documents.

Rebecca, please confirm that Carolyn has the final wiring instructions for 
the movement of money out of escrow.  

I presume that we would like to close early enough to see money move 
tomorrow, since the payoff amounts have been calculated based on closing 
tomorrow.

I don't know what is required to make the payoff to TurboPark, so I hope 
someone knowledgeable is handling that end.

My trip was postponed, so I'm around.

Wow, Rebecca was reading my mind!

Hi Chris,

Happy New Year.  Hope all is going well with you.  We miss you!

I heard a rumor that the UI deal had an asset management aspect to it.  The

I'm trying to get my hands on any docs which might give some insight into 
some  different approaches.  Do you have anything you can email me?

You raise a very interesting question on how EECC and ENA will interface in 
the future.  

I understand that ENA now has a Technical Support Group (something like 
that), and some of the folks are EECC personnel who have transferred to ENA.  
I do not know their function or role.   

As for the integration of EECC legal comments into a document, I would say 
that it would depend on the comment.  Essentially, the deals are ENA deals, 
not EECC deals, which means ENA has decision making responsibility.  Also, 
ENA is the project sponsor/owner (until sold), and NEPCO is usually the 
contractor.  The conflicts arise when NEPCO (usually not EECC on ENA deals) 
is asked to wrap certain contracts, so EECC or NEPCO takes a position as a 
contractor.  So it is difficult for EECC to act as the owner's engineer and 
the EPC contractor.

Another interface issue is that EECC contracts personnel do not typically 
involve the EECC lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the 
negotiation process.  Perhaps this has changed since I left, but that was how 
things worked when I was with EECC.  

On the finance/deal lawyer front, my question is who deals with the lenders 
and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place?

I'll let you know if I think of anything else.  I suspect Sheila will have 
some insight, also.

Kay

Rose and Kay,
Lisa has asked for a meeting between ENA and EE&CC to talk about how both 
companies are going to interface now that we are all on the same team.  We 
are still in the brainstorming stage, trying to think about the agenda for 
the meeting, and what the ENA representatives should say.  I've attached both 
an agenda and a first crack at the Project Development Process as we see it.  

It would be GREATLY APPRECIATED if you could provide some comments on how you 
envision EE&CC and ENA working together on projects, especially how you see 
the Legal teams interfacing.  I tried with a few bullet points, but please 
feel free to delete, add, amend, rewrite, etc...  I'll fax a synthesized 
version of your comments to Lisa at the  end of today.  Thank you in advance 
for your suggestions.

	Antitrust Division Won't Challenge
Electricity Distribution Cooperative

WASHINGTON (BNA) -- A proposal by 17 rural Arkansas electric power 
distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to 
retail customers passes antitrust muster, according to a Jan. 10 business 
review letter by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which could 
find no lessening of competition in any electric power market. 
The distribution cooperatives are 17 nonprofit cooperative corporations 
formed under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of Arkansas to provide 
electric service predominantly to rural consumers. 
Each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member/consumers 
that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income 
to its member/customers. 
Due to the 1999 enactment of the Electric Consumer Choice Act, which mandates 
competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as Jan. 1, 
2002, the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within Arkansas 
will change greatly. Consumers now purchase electricity only from the 
regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is 
located. Under the Act, a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric 
energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace, and the consumer's 
incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer's 
door under regulated distribution charges. 
The new legislation's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing 
activities--which will be completely competitive--from the electric utility's 
regulated transmission and distribution activities. To ensure that the 
utility's marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its 
relationship with the utility, the Act provides that employees engaged in the 
transmission and distribution system operations are required to function 
independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at 
retail. 
The act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard 
service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an 
alternative energy service provider. Distribution cooperatives, under the 
act, may serve these consumers, referred to as default consumers, directly or 
they may assign them to an affiliate. The rates for the standard service 
package will be a market rate, unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer 
a regulated rate approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission. 
The proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to 
create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers 
throughout Arkansas. All retail marketing activities outside the traditional 
local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through 
the joint marketing venture. If a distribution cooperative decides to 
withdraw from the joint venture, it may compete with the joint venture for 
any and all consumers. 
The proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide 
individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its 
default customers to the joint venture. 
Each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric 
power generating capacity in Arkansas, and the combined generating power 
capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of 
the total generating capacity in the two areas of Arkansas in which the joint 
venture is likely to market. 
The joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give 
it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets 
than would be attainable by individual members. 

Procompetitive Effects

In the business review letter, Acting Assistant Attorney General A. Douglas 
Melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not 
appear to have any anticompetitive effect. 
He commented that "while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as 
potential entrants into each other's local retail markets, regional markets 
and a state-wide market, their small size and relatively high operating costs 
make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that, if 
they tried to enter, they would offer effective competition." 
Melamed added that "the existence of other, larger potential entrants into 
[the local retail markets] would significantly diminish, if not eliminate, 
any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture 
proposal. It seems at least as likely, if not more so, that the joint retail 
marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an 
additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the 
distribution cooperatives." 
The business review letter is available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/--the 
Antitrust Division's Web site-- and a file containing the business review 
request and the division's response may be examined in the Antitrust 
Documents Group of the Antitrust Division, Suite 215, Liberty Place, 325 7th 
St., N.W., Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20004.

I'm available anytime.

   

Thomas, given that I just put a call into you on the same subject matter, it 
would be helpful for my benefit, accounting's and legal's benefit and to try 
to be timely for the People's development team, if you would arrange a 
meeting as soon as possible so we can all get on the same page.

Thanks, Lisa

Are you available for a meeting today to discuss the captioned?   The lawyers 
are a bit unclear as to what the commercial ends and means are w.r.t. these 
turbines - e.g., do we have a DASH - do we want an option vs. a purchase, are 
we "stepping in" to the People's WLB structure or are they keeping the 
financing for "our benefit", etc?

Hi Charlotte,

We've been invited to someone's house for dinner on Feb 2.  Can you take care 
of Michael?  The dinner is in River Oaks, so we could just drop him off.

Michael  got a hair cut this weekend.  I think it makes him look taller.  I 
wish it worked that way for me!  It is very short, and I think very cute.

Kay

Good  morning,

Enron's finance people are asking about the status of the turbine contract 
for Pastoria.  Since Sheila is on vacation I thought I would check with you.  
Is it in final form, and if so, has it been executed?  It would be a big help 
to get an electronic version sent to me.

Thanks,

Kay

Your vote?
   Sounds fine.  It's on my book.  Tomorrow, do you want me to take him
home or to my apartment.  I promised him something fun.

hope you were satisfied with us.

Could you and Neil come to our house for dinner on Feb. 2?

I haven't confirmed with Mark that the trip is still on, so there is still

Hi there.

Is this required by our agreement, or just a nice touch?  We have a fairly 
long list of people who we would have to track down, and it seems to me that 
these people can be replaced (or have been) without the formality of 
resigning.  I'll send you the list separately.

Thanks,

This is the contract that we said would be the jumping off point (an accurate 
description) for our GE discussions.  As I recall, we need to give it the off 
balance sheet treatment before it is distributed to the masses. Rose, can you 
take responsibility for the basic OBS stuff?  I suggest we discuss assignment 
and indemnity separately (and soon).

My assistant is setting up the legal team's conference call for Wednesday at 
830.  Details to follow.

Hi guys,

Could someone send an electronic file of the execution copy of the Coyote 
Springs contract?

Thank you,

Kay

Are you ok?

ckm

I didn't go back and check, but I believe the bills of sale or the 
assignment/assumption agreement may help, as one of these should have the 
serial number.  I think you may have a spread sheet that ties serial numbers 
to unit numbers.  At least I hope so!

Let me know if this doesn't get you what you need.

Kay
Attached are the documents that you asked me to change the signature line:

Here 'tis.  I don't think it compared the charts, but it found lots of other 
things to compare.

I think you should send them back to Lee and let him dispose of them.

Here's something to look at.

Kay

I figure longer life expectancy is just to make up for all the crummy female 
days we have.  We probably have the same number of quality days as men.  If 
that!

I don't know what's wrong with me!  The last three weeks I've been gaining 
weight steadily even though I've been working out and watching what I eat.  
Something is going on.  Today, I had to go to the gastro for my hernia and 
the fact that colon cancer runs in my family.   He took blood to check my 
organs, etc.  He also gave me my prescription for Prilosec and Vioxx (for 
arthritis).  I'm coughing and it feels like bronchitis so I'm going to the 
allergist tomorrow.  Thursday is the big day, fight with Dr. Hamilton over 
whether it's hormones, do I need a hysterectomy. get this weight off of me, 
stuff like that.  I'm miserable and I know it's not fat because it's come on 
way too soon.  Johnson said it could be a reaction to getting off the Prozac 
and I might need to get back on it.  I did lose a lot of weight when I got on 
it but the hormones had put it on me in the first place.  Being a woman is so 
hard!!!!!!!!!  Let me rephrase that, an aging woman.  The doctor even said so 
today.  He's a cutie too so if you ever have an ulcer or hiatal hernia, I 
highly recommend him.  He's really a great doctor, very thorough and you 
odn't have to take your clothes off all the time.  I love that!!!!

I saw pictures on the tv screens on one of the floors, but I didn't hear 
about the capture.  How did they do it?

They have 4 of the Texas 7!
Happened in Woodland Park, CO this morning and they think they have a good
lead on the others. They claim they have the leader also. Woodland Park is
just west of Colorado Springs.

This term sheet relates to a new deal of Mark Bernstein's.  We haven't 
responded to it yet.  I suspect you will be consulted about it soon, so I 
thought I would give you a heads up.  Roger and Herman have heard a bit about 
the project, and Joe D has been briefed.

Looks like more for TurboPark.

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Applied Finance - January 25 & 26, 2001 in EB552     Cost:  $700.00

If a better understanding of Enron's transactions (a deal) that involves 
Enron's financial as well as commercial participation with another business 
entity would help you do your job better - this course was designed for you. 

This course will give you a firm grasp of basic finance but in the context of 
Enron's commercial and financial transactions.
The objective of this class is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, 
to help you understand how basic financial principals contribute to the 
structure of a deal and provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that 
you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

To register for any of these classes, click here (), or call 713 853-0357.

This needs to be "TurboParked" (parties changed, GFinance advised).  Is there 
any special deal on payment for the change order?

I'll figure out how to change the signature lines, etc.

Chris,

On behalf of Matt Tezyk, please find attached below the Blue Dog Change Order 
for ENA's signature.  This had fallen through the cracks and Matt said that 
you would be handling it for me.  Thank you very much.

Once ENA has signed off on two (2) originals of the Change Order, you may 
return them to me at 3AC 712A.  I will then forward them to Jeffrey Darst for 
his signature.  Copies of the fully executed change order will be distributed 
upon return from GE.

Kay,
Lisa asked me to see if you would represent ENA Legal at the meeting between 
EE&CC and ENA on Monday, Jan 29th.  Having worked at both companies, you 
would add a lot of insight to the crafting of a "new project development 
process".  The agenda is for Ozzie, Mike Coleman, Lisa and you to give brief 
presentations (5-10 minutes each) on the project development process, with 
recommendations on changes to be made.  You've already seen the notes, but 
I'm attaching an updated version.  

Please let me know if you will be available and if you want to change any 
discussion bullets and/or recommendations.  The most recent message had the 
meeting taking place on Monday, January 29th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm (with 
lunch provided).  Megan will let everyone know which room will be reserved.  
There is also a pre-meeting tomorrow (Wed) at 10:30 am in EB 2868 (it should 
only last 30 minutes).  Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi there.  

Gentlemen,

I have made the revisions to paragraphs 16 and 22 as suggested.  I have also 
changed the state designation of the Tarheel notary to Texas.

If this version is acceptable, we will execute originals and forward to you.  
Do you need more than one original for the optionor?

Thank you,

Hi Kay.  How are things??  I'm trying to educate myself (always a scary 
proposition) on moving equipment out of TurboPark, since hopefully we will 
have the need to do that soon for Pastoria.  Any further thinking on the 
whole topic beyond what you've provided below?  Like where I can find forms 
of the B of S and Assignment docs?  And, did you do the docs, or does finance 
(I kind of assume we take the laboring oar on all of these, but thought I'd 
see what your experience proved to be).  Please give me a ring when 
convenient.  Thanks.

Kay Mann@ENRON
01/03/2001 07:03 AM
I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, 
with a simultaneous sale of  80% of the equity to a third party.  This deal 
is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark 
and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.  I thought I would 
share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy.

Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to 
take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is 
required.

There will be other documents involved as well:

Bill of Sale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment)

I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to 
come on this one.

As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised.

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.

Thanks,

Kay

I have attached a letter we plan to send today (or, tomorrow at the latest) 
and require copies of letter's from SW that Dan Schultz references in his 
Nov. 10th letter.  In addition, there is another matter regarding other 
correspondence we need to have in hand that other letters reference.  Most 
notably, a reference to a request from Scott Laidlaw (dated January 12, 2001) 
noted in Lynn DeKrey's letter on January 18, 2001.

Absence of this correspondence jeapordizes our claim!  We need to close the

Please see if you can get me 30 minutes via phone with John Klauberg at 130 
today.  He mentioned in his voice mail that he might want to bring in someone 
else from his firm,  which is fine.  Mark Bernstein will also be on the call.

I'll call him at 130 (CST) if he is available.  

Thanks,

Kay

So are you Gold?  If not, go ahead and use the miles if you want.  

Nancy,

I believe we are scheduled to start at 900am Thursday.  I had a voice mail 
from Heather that said she was planning to spend the night Thursday in case 
the meeting went long, or we wanted to continue on Friday.  I haven't heard 
where we will be staying. 

As for the interconnection agreement, it would be great to have a internal 
working draft this week.  That way we can discuss it with Heather and make 
good use of our time.  Also, we could  have some general, preliminary 
discussions with VEPCO about it, if we feel ready.  

I've been trying to get a form from someone around here, but haven't had any 
luck.  Perhaps someone BP's Houston office has an "Enron form".  Sheryl 
Gussett's name is next to "interconnection agreement" on our document team 
list.

Kay

Will you still be planning to come to DC to meet on Wed afternoon?  Also, is 
there a time for Thursday's meeting?  It's approx. a 2 hour drive from DC, so 
if the meeting is scheduled to start very early on Thursday, I may also need 
to come down on Wednesday eve.

One other question.  What is your timing on the interconnection agreement?  I 
have been assuming that it is not on the agenda for Thursday, although I do 
plan to work on it this week.  Thanks.

I'm glad that Michael had the opportunity to meet Dr. B.  Thanks for making 
that happen.

Tomorrow is fine.

Kay-Carolyn is out until tomorrow.  She has the originals.  Can you wait
until then?  If not, I'll retrieve them.

ENA Legal (TBD)
1. ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the 
transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related 
agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development 
Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project 
(O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement, 
etc.).  

2. ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and 
development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all 
legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as 
required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.  

3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax 
in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as 
required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the 
structure.

Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA:
1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting 
documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been 
agreed.  
2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at 
the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same 
project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of 
any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance 
with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained.
3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next 
draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with 
the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to 
vendors.
4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to 
both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as 
possible.  Forms of "standard" agreements should be discussed/agreed to 
enhance consistency.
5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction 
which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should 
be prepared by EECC.  EECC should provide information concerning the 
existence of such service agreements.
6.  ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in 
drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts 
personnel have been tasked to prepare. EECC Legal can assist by providing 
input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts.

Just got it, so I haven't read it.  Please let me know what you think.

interests in one or both of the following project entities:

Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG 
before Christmas.  At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at 
Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities 
Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power.  
Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but 
Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December.

I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in 
proceeding with a transaction in the near future.  I will forward you a copy 
of this letter for your records.  They have verbally indicated that the 
Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them.

I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and 
transfer things from Lisa to yourself.  Please call me to discuss the SPA 
once you have reviewed the appropriate documents.  I will be in Chicago 
tomorrow.  I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a 
voicemail.  I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday.

Here's the latest from GE.

When I spoke to Rob Stevens, he had a question about whether Mitsui needed to 
review the final drafts of the GE agreements. I don't know the resolution of 
that issue.

As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days 
of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the 
contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui 
can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.  Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui 
bought in on the payment plan?

I do not know the status of the tax issues raised by Jeff. I would also like 
to make sure that Jeff agrees with the mechanism of superseding the prior 
agreement with GE.  

Kay

Kay,
I'm faxing to you the documents highlighted in RED, below.
So, it looks like we need to supercede these documents, along with the
assignment and assumption agreement. 
I believe the entities I mentioned yesterday are still applicable.  
If you have a different opinion, let me know.
Give me a call at 518-385-7722, and let's get the documents in condition to
be signed today or tomorrow.

Jeff Smith

The "MOU" consists of the GE proposal #80518 w/ offer letter of August 12,
1998, and J.M. Bollinger's (President, Cogen Tech) acceptance letter of
August 14, 1998.  These letters set the framework of the agreement,
including payment / termination schedule.  Invoicing & payments began in
September, 1998..and have continued on that basis until each of the
individual contracts for Linden & "Midwest" were consummated.  In Dec., 99,
at Enron's request,we allocated  funds paid to date to Linden and the "third
unit".  We'll forward copies of above.

The collective memory at ENA is that there wasn't an MOU per se, just the
assignment and assumption agreement.

Here is one option.  The problem would be getting him picked up when I'm out 
of town.  Charlotte might be able to help.  Also, there's the Presby church.  
I wonder if SOTW has something.  He might enjoy a visit.

At this time it appears that I will be going to NYC on Wednesday, returning 
Friday afternoon or possibly Thursday night.  I'll miss the Turbopark closing 
dinner, which is not all bad, as it will save me a lot of calories and a 
headache.  I will miss getting the pat on the back.  I didn't want to miss 
Michael's open house, though, as that was more important.

Hi Charlotte,

We are starting to check out our options for the summer, and one of the 
things we are considering is the day camp that Enron is involved with.  They 
pick up and deliver from the Enron building, and I was wondering if you might 
consider picking Michael up from here (Enron).  I suspect most days he could 
go to your place.

I have no idea if this is the direction we will go, but I thought I would run 
it by you early on.  I have to think about how much travel I might have, as 
it might be hard on Neil to take Michael downtown in the morning.  Paige has 
applied for a job at Enron, though, so if that worked out we would be in good 
shape.

Here's a link.   They have some neat themes.

well.

Thanks,

Kay

Hey, we all can use a little money.  Life doesn't seem to get any cheaper.

Hello ladies.

I have the signed original (all parnters have signed) of the going out of
business documents for Anglers.  What is next?

Honey, Kay seems to think there is one more form of some kind, plus a filing
fee.  What do you know about those items?  I'm ready to make a final
distribution and let you close out the account.  I'll be happy to deliver
these papers to whomever is the appropriate person, agencey, etc. and help
in any way to stop the insanity.
Can we obtain the final cost for filing the papers, keep that in cash and
make the final checks out?

My Anglers papers show the following percentages, just in case you've gotten
rid of your files:

Alves         21.775
Ashworth        4.265
Bailey         10.895
Dill         10.895
Lockwood      15.235
Mann           4.265
Napoli         10.895
Turner         21.775

And......Kay, before you start making some smart ...comments,  I don't need
the money and in fact I'll buy the first and last bottle of Krug if we can
get together for a final distribution ceremony.

As I always tell Dill (a.k.a. Mokhtar, his new Egyptian
nickname).......Praise Allah.

Gerry Turner

We have 4 of each of these available at $19 (or whatever face value is).  
Just let me know what you want to do.

   This sounds good.  I would love for him to participate.  Since it
would be at Enron, I can't see any problem.  If you were out of town, I
could take him home or work it out with Neil.  Anyway, if Paige is accepted,
I would be happy to be backup.  Since the pickup is at Enron, in case of an
office emergency (which I seriously doubt), I could pick Michael up and
bring him to my office for the short time required to finish the job.  As I
said, I think this is moot, but we would have it covered from all angles.

Well,  there's an argument to be made that the remedy for breach of an option 
agreement is us suing them for specific performance, ie, making them sell us 
the land.  Since we shouldn't have any obligations under an option agreement, 
I don't worry about arbitration.  Let me think about it, though.

   
	
	

For some reason we did deleted the Arbritration Paragraph in the 
Electrocities Option Agreement.  Shouldn't I add it to this new Option (seems 
kind of important).

Good idea about taking the sausage.

Are you going to the store?  If you do, I could use some Diet Coke, silver

Reagan,

Attached is the revised North Carolina form of Option.  It has been confirmed 
that the Option renewal payments must not exceed 5% of the purchase price.

.

Ok.  My hubby tells me the tickets you want are available, and he'll put your 
name on them, so to speak.

Kay,

If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
would like to purchase those.

Do you mind checking to see if you have 2 tickets for March 1 (Def Leppard), 
if you do I would like to purchase those also.

Just let me know.

Thanks so much!

I am soooo sorry I made a mistake.  My daughter's schedule will allow her to 
attend Clay Walker - not Def Leppard.

If you still have 2 tickets for February 13 (Clay Walker) I would like to 
purchase those.

If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
would like to purchase those.

Sorry for the confusion.

Thank you!!

Ann,

I'll be there.  

Thanks,

Kay

Any idea what the going rate is for a limo on a Thursday?  Nothing 
extraordinary needed, just your basic version.  

Thanks,

Kay

It should be under Diaz, Ann, if she got an invite.  Surely she got invited.

Corey,

Thanks.  Was the doc based on any previous Enron transactions?

Thanks,

john - thanx for your time on phone this afternoon.

a) just received cc of letter from westinghouse.  in it, they assert that:

"title to the existing generator passed to enron upon delivery into the 
united states.  delivery occurred at houston on or about 23jul00.  as 
required by the contract and incoterms 1990, risk of loss to the generator 
passed to enron when the generator arrived (ddp) at houston while the 
generator remained on board the common carrier.  the generator was delivered 
in an undamaged condition.  title and risk of loss passed to enron before the 
water damage to the generator occurred."

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

b) per the contract between enron and westinghouse:

section 15.1.2 title to Equipment - Title to the Equipment will pass to 
Purchaser immediately upon entry into the united states.
section 15.2 risk of loss - Seller shall bear the risk of loss and damage 
with respect to the Equipment until delivery of the Equipment to the Delivery 
Point in accordance with Section 3.2.1.  Seller shall be required to inspect 
the Equipment for damage at the Delivery Point.
section 3.2.1 - Seller shall cause the Equipment to be delivered to the 
Delivery Point on a DDP basis in accordance with Sections 10.2.1 by the date 
set forth therein.
section 3.2.2 - Seller shall be responsible for delivering the CT-Unit DDP to 
the: (iii) u.s. port of export by any means of transport.
section 3.2.3 - Seller shall perform customs clearance for the Equipment 
through u.s. customs and pay any import duties.
section 10.2.1 Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date - Seller will cause the CT-Unit 
(author's note - includes the generator) to be delivered in an undamaged 
condition in accordance with the Specification-CT to the Delivery Point (DDP) 
in accordance with Schedule I below (the Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date).  
(author's note - the date specified in the contract was later slipped per 
agreement with enron).
section 10.2.3 Completion of Delivery - delivery of the CT-Unit to the 
Delivery Point shall be considered complete for the purposes of Delivery 
Liquidated Damages as it pertains to the delivery of Major Components 
(author's note - includes the GT and generator) when the last Major Component 
of such CT-Unit is delivered DDP to the Delivery Point in complete and 
undamaged condition.  ...  Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the 
Equipment for condition of the Equipment upon actual delivery.  Purchaser 
reserves the right to reject damaged Equipment at any location; however, in 
the event a portion of the Equipment is damaged or defective upon delivery to 
the Delivery Point, Purchaser after making an initial assessment of the 
damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect 
the installation , operation, performance, reliability, efficiency, and 
warranty of the damaged Equipment may either:
(i) reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the 
preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept 
delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred, 
or
(ii) after taking into account such criteria and Seller's proposed plan for 
correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section 9.5, declare that 
delivery has occurred: in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or 
defect, it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical.

c) facts of the case, as we know them:

common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of 
houston approx. 14jul00.  i.e., that was the ship's estimated time of arrival 
(eta).
westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about 23jul00.
enron representative (frank cervenka) went to CTSS (i.e., the westinghouse 
facility here in houston) on friday, 21jul00 to inspect the combustion 
turbine.  during that inspection, westinghouse employees informed him that 
the generator had salt water damage at the port.  as a result, the following 
monday, 24jul00, he visited the port of houston with the siemens-westinghouse 
insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator.  note - this was just a 
cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged.  the full 
extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time - 
e.g., repair or replace were still viable options.
enron received formal notification (faxed letter) of the damaged generator on 
approx. 18aug00.
enron has already made progress payments to siemens-westinghouse in the 
amount of 95% of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator.
DDP, per incoterms 1990, means delivered duty paid.
Westinghouse, despite 2 prior requests from enron, has not provided copies of 
the customs clearance documentation.  i.e., we don't know the exact date that 
the generator cleared customs, or if it cleared customs.
title means ownership, but does not imply either risk of loss or care, 
custody, and control.  with title comes both ownership and the responsibility 
for payment of taxes.

d) info not known by enron:

when did ship come into port?
when did damage to generator occur?
when, or if, u.s. customs duties were paid?

f) info known by enron:

generator is a total loss, as determined by westinghouse.
per section 10.2.3 of contract, enron was not given the formal opportunity to 
inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port.  as 
recalled by matt tezyk, westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing 
that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred.  
(author's note - matt to find cc of that letter).

g) enron's assertions are that:

DDP was not satisfied.  i.e., delivery of the generator did not occur in 
accordance with the terms of the contract.
title (i.e., ownership) remains with siemens-westinghouse.
risk of loss remains with siemens-westinghouse.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

john - plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon 
under separate cover.  we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery, in 
accordance with the contract, of the CT-Unit occurred or not.  plz call with 
any questions.  regards.  scott.

Lisa Bills and I spoke concerning this transaction, and what kind of document 
we can put in front of Peoples at this time.  Here are the highlights from 
our conversation:

Enron can't enter into a binding commitment to purchase the equipment without 
putting the Moore project on the balance sheet.  Therefore, either WestLB 
needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an 
option agreement.  There is room in the WestLB facility for the turbines; 
however, RAC needs to approve the purchase.  Lisa advises that Transaction 
Support (Herman or Roger) needs to buy in as well.

I understand we would like to present a binding agreement to Peoples 
tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the 
Moore project off the balance sheet. 

I'm available to discuss this.  Lisa advises that she will be in tomorrow as 
well.

Lisa, please correct me if any of this is not accurate.

Kay

I was supposed to make a "To Do" list of the World Hunger Team:

Limit of liability/Indemnity - Steve has provided a draft.

Assignment - although we reached an accord for TurboPark purposes, the basic 
issues remain for discussion.

Confidentiality - Mike has circulated a revised draft.

Termination - This ones on my list.

Warranty - Scott has some comments to discuss.

We also discussed streamlining the time lines, etc.

Kay

I don't think Carolyn needs them, but I will think about it.

   
	
	

FYI, I received the docs from Wiener today via federal express.  I'll get 
with you on Monday and send them to Carolyn (or whatever you want).

Hi Clark,

Good to hear from you.  I'm headed to NYC this week, so lunch doesn't look 
good.  I would love to see Nancy, though.  She did a very nice job for us.

I can't find any information on Corey.  Can you give me a little background 
information?  I couldn't find him in the BP directory or website.

Hope all is well with you, and I hope we can get together soon.

Kay

Hope all is well.  I know it has been a while and I was hoping to catch up.  
Corey Brown left me a message that you had called to ask us to work on a 
couple of divestitures in Illinois, and I wanted to thank you for keeping us 
involved.  As I have said before, we really like working with you all and 
want to be as much help as possible.  I have expanded our group so that we 
can provide more flexiblity and have greater availability to you.

Would you have time over the next week or so to grab lunch and catch up?  
Nancy Wodka will be in town on Tuesday and Wednesday, and I was wondering if 
one of those would work for you?  There is an outside chance that I might 
have to go to NC on Wednesday, but Tuesday should be fine either way.  Let me 
know if one of these works for you or if another time would be better.

Look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

Per Barbara's request, here's a summary of much of what I'm working on:

Co Op City asset management arrangement:  In this deal, Enron would build a 
small power generation facility for a housing co op in the Bronx, Co Op 
City.  We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas), 
market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake.  
We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the 
balance sheet and maximize the mark.  We are working on  a term sheet, and I 
will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer.  
Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO 
Houston is  involved.  I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would 
like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.  

Sell of two development projects in Illinois.  Two of the sites we have 
developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me 
about supporting the transaction.  Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted 
Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of 
experience of the person they have designated.  I've asked Clark Thompson for 
some information on his background.  

SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the 
equipment.  We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of 
this equipment.  We are also trying to sell the equipment (a 
turbine/generator set) to Calpine.  

Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a 
company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.  We 
received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw.  
We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them 
buying 26 megawatts. We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and 
the project development agreement with the State.  It is quiet right now, as 
funding is figured out.

There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.

GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a 
standard contract for buying turbines.  I've heard a rumor that we will be 
buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.  

I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.

Well, there's no instant gratification with that, although it is logical.

If you would like new carpet then I think we should get new carpet. Do we
want to let Rosco get a little older so accidents are less likely?  NM

Kay,

Attached is the final draft of the Two-Train Contract for the Pastoria
Project.  The parties have agreed in a side letter to complete the contract
for the third train (which should be nearly identical) by July 31, 2000.

The execution copies of the Two-Train Contract were signed by GE and
returned to me today and should be on their way to West LB tomorrow for
execution.

There were two changes to the Two-Train Contract that were hand marked by GE
on the execution copies and are not reflected in the attached electronic
copy.  Both are minor.  The first is that in the Notice provision (Article
XXV) the name, telephone number and and fax number for the GE contact person
is crossed out with an indication that the person will be named at the Order
Definition Meeting.  The second is that the Xonon Technoloy was excepted out
of Section 30.12(f), which is the provision stating that the equipment sold
by GE under the contract is of the same type, model etc. sold to other GE
customers and has no demonstrated trends of failure.

Please call me with any additional questions.

We do not have a current CA with PB.  I will have one in the am to send out.

Do you want Jude, et al to look at the EPC contract stuff?

Absolutely.

Lisa,

I've made some preliminary suggestions on the term sheet. We will have some 
comments on the asset management attachment, but I don't have those together

In looking through our files I don't find a confidentiality agreement.  
Therefore, I'm attaching a draft of what we would like to have executed so

It looks like your memory serves you well.  Section 6.8.2 allows the Managing 
Member to designate officers of enovate.  I revised the original appointment 
declaration you prepared to reflect Laura as VP.  Take a look at it and let

at your convenience.

$25?
Friends and Colleagues,

I want to apologize in advance for the impersonal nature of this request; 
but, I believe that the potential results may justify the means.  I am 
requesting that each of you strongly consider making a contribution to the 
American Diabetes Association.  My sister, Valerie, who is a school teacher 
at the Rice School has organized a "School Walk" to benefit the ADA.  
Although I am always reluctant to solicit contributions from my friends and 
co-workers, I feel emotionally compelled to do so this time.  In addition to 
my sister's involvement in this fund raiser, my brother Steven was diagnosed 
several years ago with Adult On-Set Juvenile Diabetes and I have seen first 
hand what a terrible disease this can be to manage.  There is good news, as 
many of you know.  The research in this area has made great strides in recent 
years and I am encouraged that someday soon there will be a cure.

In this regard, I would truly appreciate any contribution that each of you 
might be able to make.  Something as small as $5.00 would be great. (although 
if your pockets are full and you want to give more that is ok too)  I would 
be forever grateful if, through the donations that I am able to collect, I am 
able to make a difference.  Please feel free to send your checks via 
inter-office mail or stop by if you wish.  Thank you for your consideration.

With much appreciation,

Stuart

I ran a redline from the last version I had electronically. 

I've forwarded the current version to Herman for his review and approval.  
Due to some of the changes, Enron may need some revisions as well.

Here we go with a renewal that puts us to 7.6%, but the purchase price is not 
so much.
	
	

Kay,

The payment that is due on Saturday will put us at 7.631%.    I really would 
like to Federal Express out tonight because the November payment got lost in 
the mail and I had to order another check to send to them.  Please advise.

Hi David, 

The owner is willing to do this cost plus.  Do you have a cost plus form that 
you like?  

It was good to see you yesterday, by the way.  

Do you want me to include you on follow up emails on this?

with the sale we have agreed to not contest Siemens Westinghouse retaining 
the Blue Girl reservation payments.  SW has asked that LJM sign off on the 
agreement, and Rose has suggested that I send the original agreements to you, 
and indicated that she would help coordinate signature.

Your help is appreciated.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

I've sent it to the Finance group who will obtain LJM signature.  If I have 
any problem (ie, it looks like it won't be done this week), I'll let you know 
so maybe you can expedite on the commercial side.  I'd like to give them a 
day or two first.

Kay

   

That's the correct amount.  The payment is due, according to the contract, 
"10 business days of complete execution of this agreement". Kay is getting 
the last sig now.  Kay, can you advise when you expect execution?

Mitch

Mitch -

We are trying to finalize the costs for the 2000 peakers and Mike Miller said 
that you are working on the settlement with Westinghouse.  Is the amount 
still estimated at $1,567,099?  Do you know when this payment will need to be 
made?

thanks,

Sorry if I'm a little late in the day.  I feel into marathon meeting mode 
today.

Here are my observations of the GE contract.  I tried to confine it to 
significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along.

General Terms and Conditions
I don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for 
performance/warranty issues.  Final payment is made at shipment, with the 
Buyer having the benefit of a 10% retention bond; however, the retention bond 
expires at Provisional Acceptance.  There is no financial leverage for Final 
Acceptance or the warranty period.  Also, usually provisional or final 
acceptance requires that GE provide the operating manuals.

The assignment language (8) is somewhat narrow.  I don't know the deal, so I 
don't know how it fits. It can help to have language which allows for free 
assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full, whichever occurs 
first.  Also, the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment 
security, in lieu of the buyer guaranty.  Again, I don't know the deal so 
this may be fine as is.

The contract incorporates GE's proposal as a  part of the contract, but does 
not give an order of precedence.  I haven't seen the proposal or any other 
technical exhibits, but sometimes these can be very self-serving.  Therefore, 
you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit.

Warranty.  The language is a bit confusing to me, especially the interplay of 
the 1st and 2nd paragraph.  Also, the "outs" they have are very broad.  It is 
better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in 
accoredance with their written instructions (alternatively, industry 
practice).  Also, they have an out if repairs are performed without their 
permission, but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a 
warranty claim.  A statement that they must provide a service engineer within 
3 days or so might help.  I also suggest being clear that 1.2 applies to 
warranty obligations, but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty 
problems need to be explicit.

Excusable Delay. (15) I would delete "indirectly" from the 3rd line.

Provisional Acceptance. I don't understand the phrase "only to the extent and 
proportional share".  Does this mean that GE may not be liable for the full 
LD's, or that the buyer has to prove  a right to collect LD's?

Litigation. The dispute resolution (mediation then  litigation) is not 
consistent with the usual arbitration route we request.

I didn't take a hard look at LD's, since I assumed these are settled.

13.6 Enron typically gets more precise language than this.  For instance, I 
would delete or clarify the phrase "including that due to environment or 
operation", as being vague.  13.6 (i)The phrase "proper storage, 
installation, operation and maintenance" should be as defined by GE's written 
instructions, or at least based on industry standards. 13.6 (ii) could 
conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair, then not allow us to 
get someone else to do the work.

14.1  The last line should include the words "strict liability" after 
"negligence". GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they 
introduce.

This is a quick look.  If you need more detailed information (and you think 
there's time to negotiate further), I can look at it in more detail.

I spoke to Jon Stroble of El Paso today and he as agreed to delay signing this
agreement until next week.   We need to get him any comments by close of
business on Monday, July 17.    Can you please review and get me comments 
ASAP.
thanks and sorry for the short notice.
Cory,

Please see comments in attached file.  I changed the date to July 14th
assuming we can sign on this date.

 <<agree_6_13_00.doc>>    <<TsCs_6_28_00.doc>>      <<pricing_06_23_00.xls>>

I'm hoping you can rewrite these files incorporating these comments as well
as Shelly's comment below and Mike Neuman's comment from his 6/28 email
copied below.

Parent Guarantee-We feel the dollar amount for the parent guarantee should
be raised from $33Mill to $37mill to allow us some room in case of change
orders.  In any event, the Contract Price is approximately $35mill.

Thanks,
Jon

          -----Original Message-----
          Jon and I met with East Coast Power this morning to discuss
the contribution by El Paso of the GE Turbine for the Linden 7 Site.  The
assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the
assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word
affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a
49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate.  I
would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the
word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East
Coast Power L.L.C.).  Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like
to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue
when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El
Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an
ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the
presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this
with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP.  Finally, I
would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment,
we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP.

Hello Kay -

It's been a long time since we've last spoken and I hope things are well.
In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related
to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly.  I finally
have reviewed them and have a couple comments.

The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a
confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.
However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular
agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in
connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual
relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's
and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes
are my attempt to clarify the usual text.

Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has
resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your
attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.

I think we scared him.

I spoke to Sheila and Steve a few minutes ago and we all agreed to
reschedule the meeting for next week.  Steve is to check with his guys as
to what day/time will work for GE next week and I will do the same with the
Enron folks.  Steve and I hope to coordinate and firm up the schedule this
Friday at which time we will notify each of you.

The weekly GE conference call will go forward today at 1:30 p.m. CT.  For
those of you in Houston, EB38C1 has been reserved.

DIAL IN, 1-888-285-4585, PART CODE 536220

I made it to NYC with no problem.  The weather is nice enough, but windy.  
I'm on my way to a meeting.

Fred,

If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to 
the form, then duplicate it.  Do you see any problem with this? I will have 
to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.  I 
brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form. Have 
they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still 
kicking tires?  I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's 
most important, especially since I'm on the road.  Do we want to continue 
marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination?  
I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.  No TurboPark!!!

On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the 
customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.  Monday would be 1000 
times better, if this is at all possible.  In that won't work, I will have 
more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

I have been talking with a developer at Constellation Power in Baltimore 
regarding their interest in our development entities in several eastern U.S. 
regions.  He indicated that their interest in Illinois is low, but that they 
have a higher degree of interest in our development projects in the following 
areas:
 
 Missouri
 Georgia
 TVA region
 Louisiana

Please prepare a draft CA that I can forward to Constellation for their 
review.  It should encompass the above 4 regions.  The CA should also include 
the following:

Unilateral language (Constellation keeps ENA information confidential - ENA 
not obligated to do the same for Constellation information)
No non-compete language
Texas law governs (let's start with this - and I'll default to New York law 
if Constellation balks at Texas)
2 year term
Counterparty:   Constellation Power
Contact: Mr. Todd Jaffe

Call me to discuss.  If you are tied up in NY, can Kathleen prepare this 
using one of our recent CA's with other developers? (i.e.Entergy)

Let me know.

Fred

OK.  Friday was going to be really difficult for me anyway.

Gentlemen,

As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which 
has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power 
plant.  We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and 
since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use 
something that is acceptable to NEPCO.  I will then take the laboring oar in 
order to get a working draft prepared for this project.

As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment:
Get their parents to
 tell them a story with a moral at the end of it. The
next cay the kids
 came back and one by one began to tell their stories.

Janey said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of
egg-laying hens.
One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket
on the front seat of
the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the
eggs went flying and
broke and made a mess.

"And what's the moral of the story?" asked the teacher.
"Don't put all
your eggs in one basket!"

"Very good," said the teacher.

Next little Lucy raised a hand and said, "Our family
are farmers too. But
we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen
eggs one time, but
when
they hatched we only got ten live chicks and the moral
to this story is,
don't count your chickens until they're hatched."

"That was a fine story Lucy

Johnny, do you have a story to share?"

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my Aunt
Karen. Aunt Karen
was a flight engineer in Desert Storm and her plane got
hit.  She had to
bail
out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle
of whiskey, a
machine gun and a machete. She drank the whiskey on the
way down so it
wouldn't
break and then she landed right in the middle of 100
enemy troops. She
killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she
ran out of  bullets,
then she killed twenty more with the machete till the
blade broke and then
she killed the last ten with her bare hands.

"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "what kind
of moral did your
  Daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Stay the Hell away from Aunt Karen when she's been
drinking."

Here tis!

It doesn't look like it is going to work out to meet  today.  We should be 
back next week, though.

Kay

Many thanks.  

When I first started in the E & C bidness all our company did was cost plus 
work.  I may have some old exhibits about how the mulitplier was used to 
capture benefits and burdens, both for field people and home office.  You 
know the goal is to never create an original document!

Davidlu@nepco.com on 02/01/2001 12:23:43 PM
Kay,  I got your message this morning.  Enjoy the big apple.  I presume you
got my mark ups on the term sheet.  I am investigating with the NEPCO folks
if they have any particular form of cost plus contract.  JWVS just informed
me he had one that he will forward to me.  I know from past history that
NEPCO is not set up from an accounting viewpoint to give a lot of detailed
breakdown of costs in terms of labor hours, burdens and benefits since they
are calculated and charged to a project based on assignment of people.

I'll stay in touch.

I'm in NYC, returning tomorrow.  Neil hasn't mentioned Mac calling, but I 
really didn't think we would hear from him again before today.

We meant to leave the stereo - hope you don't mind.  Paige got a new one for 
Christmas, and her old one seemed perfect for the Pink House.  

We enjoyed our visit also.  Thanks for everything.

Sorry to hear about the girls.  Tis the season.  I hope Lisa has a nice 
birthday tomorrow, even with sick kids.

Gotta go meet someone.

Love,

Kay

HiKay Kay. Just a short note since we are not sure if you are in Houston.
We sure found alot of goodies when we got here. The music center is great.
Did you intend to leave it here ? We REALLY enjoyed your,Michael and
Roscoe's short visit. Lisa sent an email yesterday saying the girls were
sick. Annie had 102 fever. Have you heard from Mac lately? Love to
all.Mother

You might hear from Mac tonight (hope so!).  You can give him my cell phone 
for when he gets in, and we can leave a key under the doormat.

Gotta go meet Mark.

Love,

Kay

Great! This will give you some free time a home.

Yes, but let me review it  before anyone else sees it.

Thanks,

Fred, do you have an address for Dynegy?  Kay, do you want me to do a draft 
of this?

K-

Fred Mitro@ECT
02/01/2001 02:32 PM
Kay:

I talked with Gary Hickey at Dynegy this afternoon regarding their interest 
in doing a deal involving one or both of the following:

 1.  Purchasing 100% of the member interests of an ENA development project,

 2.  A transaction involving generation equipment (7EA, W 501D5A, or LM 6000)

Gary is a V.P. over Dynegy's eastern U.S. and International Development 
group.  He indicated that their preferred areas for a development project 
transaction would be in the SERC, PJM, and Illinois regions.  I described the 
equipment available for transactions and Gary said that he would take a few 
days to look into it and get back to me.

Please draft a CA that would encompass these potential transaction 
structures.  I am sure that Enron and Dynegy must have a form of CA that has 
been agreed upon in the past.  Let's see if we can use that form with only 
the minimal required changes.  Please forward me the draft so that I can get 
it to Gary by Monday.  I am cc Kathleen as she is looking into the 
Constellation Power CA for you.

Thanks,
Fred

Not yet.  We are working on a solution.

Do I need to get involved?

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	01/22/2001 04:50 PM
		
Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is a legal memo regarding Westinghouse's delivery obligations with 
respect to the 501D5A gas turbine generator package.  I will forward you an 
additional copy by fax.

TFAH  

I hope that spelling your name correctly will help this get through to you.

Kay

Here's the latest from GE.

When I spoke to Rob Stevens, he had a question about whether Mitsui needed to 
review the final drafts of the GE agreements. I don't know the resolution of 
that issue.

As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days 
of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the 
contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui 
can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.  Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui 
bought in on the payment plan?

I do not know the status of the tax issues raised by Jeff. I would also like 
to make sure that Jeff agrees with the mechanism of superseding the prior 
agreement with GE.  

Kay

jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com on 06/06/2000 09:47:54 AM
Kay,
I'm faxing to you the documents highlighted in RED, below.
So, it looks like we need to supercede these documents, along with the
assignment and assumption agreement. 
I believe the entities I mentioned yesterday are still applicable.  
If you have a different opinion, let me know.
Give me a call at 518-385-7722, and let's get the documents in condition to
be signed today or tomorrow.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

Thank you.  That would be helpful.
Kay

karl.siverling@ps.ge.com <mailto:karl.siverling@ps.ge.com>  on 06/06/2000

The "MOU" consists of the GE proposal #80518 w/ offer letter of August 12,
1998, and J.M. Bollinger's (President, Cogen Tech) acceptance letter of
August 14, 1998.  These letters set the framework of the agreement,
including payment / termination schedule.  Invoicing & payments began in
September, 1998..and have continued on that basis until each of the
individual contracts for Linden & "Midwest" were consummated.  In Dec., 99,
at Enron's request,we allocated  funds paid to date to Linden and the "third
unit".  We'll forward copies of above.
Karl Siverling
The collective memory at ENA is that there wasn't an MOU per se, just the
assignment and assumption agreement.

Brian,
I spoke to Karl today, and we tried to find the "MOU".  All we have found
was the "Assignment & Assumption Letter" you mention.  In that document, the
Enron and GE entities were; Enron Capitol & Trade Resources Corp. and
General Electric Company, respectively.
Regards,
Jeff Smith

I have a copy of the "Assignment and Assumption Letter"  where GE agreed
that Cogen Technologies could assign the rights to purchase the Units to

Here's a revised draft of the agreement with Peoples.

Kay

How's about we talk about it?  I think that's more efficient.  As long as we 
talk before the next call, we should be in good shape.

Kay

Could I please get your feedback on the comments I sent to you re the 
Indemnity, LOL and Nondisclosure provisions so that I can consolidate and 
send our comments to GE on Monday (unless of course you took these up with GE 
in the last call that I missed).

Thanks,

Scott

Hi there. This came in while I was on the road.

Mac mentioned his girlfriend, but he didn't mention the Rice thing.  Hmmm.  
We would love to have him at UH, since he won't aim any higher, and we thing 
it beats SWTS.  He and his friend were wonderful house guests.  

I hope no one got worse on your b day.  Many happy returns!

Love,

Kay

Hi Kay! How are you guys doing? We had hoped that maybe we would be coming
over to Houston Saturday to see UT play baseball and then maybe try to see
yall Sunday before we drove back. BUT! As luck would have it, Annie, Katie
and Bobby are all various degrees of sick.

So, unless there is miraculous improvement in the next 24 hours, it looks
like we will be staying in Austin. Oh well. We hope to make another trip
down there before too long.

Well, I'm due at school, but I wanted to say hi and tell you that we won't
be coming down. I hear that Mac is coming down? That's great. I hope that he
likes what he sees at UH. You know his girlfriend has been offered a
scholarship to Rice, I think.

Anyway, Have a great Ground Hogs Day. It doesn't feel too different to be
40, rather than 39 and 364 days, so I guess I'll make it through the day.

Take care and tell everyone hello!

Love you!

Hi there.

Nothings comes off the list.  New additions are as follows:

New transaction with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, relating to the creation of 
a jointly owned control area to address generation,  transmission, and retail 
load delivery.  It is brand-spanking new, so I don't know much more than 
this.  It is being handled by Ozzie Pagan.

New opportunity with New Jersey Natural to develop projects using Fuel 
Cells.  Heather Kroll is the contact.

Sale of Blue Dog (GE) turbine.  Likely buyer (at last word) is NRG.  Could be 
complicated if GE protests.

There's a rumor that we are buying some new turbines from GE, but I haven't 
been contacted.  The rumor came from 
GE reps, who asked if I was working on it.  Sheila isn't handling, either, 
last I knew.

Everything else is the same.  I expect to be in NYC in the middle of the week 
to continue negotiations on the Co Op City deal (with Mark Bernstein).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Per Barbara's request, here's a summary of much of what I'm working on:

Co Op City asset management arrangement:  In this deal, Enron would build a 
small power generation facility for a housing co op in the Bronx, Co Op 
City.  We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas), 
market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake.  
We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the 
balance sheet and maximize the mark.  We are working on  a term sheet, and I 
will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer.  
Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO 
Houston is  involved.  I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would 
like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.  

Sell of two development projects in Illinois.  Two of the sites we have 
developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me 
about supporting the transaction.  Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted 
Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of 
experience of the person they have designated.  I've asked Clark Thompson for 
some information on his background.  

SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the 
equipment.  We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of 
this equipment.  We are also trying to sell the equipment (a 
turbine/generator set) to Calpine.  

Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a 
company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.  We 
received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw.  
We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them 
buying 26 megawatts. We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and 
the project development agreement with the State.  It is quiet right now, as 
funding is figured out.

There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.

GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a 
standard contract for buying turbines.  I've heard a rumor that we will be 
buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.  

I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.

Kay

This is a slam dunk. Don't screw it up.

Ok, seriously.  Carlos, you missed a wonderful evening on Friday.  John, it 
is hard to believe that  you could have acutually have married UP.  Good for 
you.  Please thank  Debbie for a perfect night.  

John, more details on the platimum AMEX with President's Club membership.  
For real?

I'll process the assignment to John on Monday.  I don't expect a problem, and 
am ready for it if it surfaces.  No big deal.

Kay:

I don't see a problem with reaching agreement on one form (Kendall LLC) and 
then duplicating it for the Titan project if we transact on both.

I am expecting a call this morning from PSEG's developer to discuss site 
visit(s) and the due diligence binder(s).  I believe that they are serious on 
moving forward on the Kendall project.  I will determine their interest in 
transacting on the Titan project.

Since we are not asking for any money down, I would like to be able to keep 
marketing the sites until the transaction closes.  

It is still unclear to me how the closing would go on this deal.  Would they 
sign the SPA and wire the money simultaneous with our signing over the LLC 
member interests or would these events occur on two different dates?  Let me 
know how you see it happening.  It seems to me that we could make it all 
happen at one time.

On the NRG call, I am waiting to hear back from NRG.  Based on my discussions 
with them yesterday, Friday is looking like a tough day for the call (Ben is 
unavailable in the afternoon and the NRG guys are travelling in the 
morning).  Either it will happen Friday afternoon without you/Ben (commercial 
issues only) or we will set it up for Monday.

Fred

Kay Mann@ENRON
01/31/2001 07:42 PM
Fred,

If we have the same purchaser for both, it would be a lot easier to agree to 
the form, then duplicate it.  Do you see any problem with this? I will have 
to have the electronic form emailed to me, then I can make the changes.  I 
brought the hard copy, but I don't have access to the electronic form. Have 
they indicated if they want to go forward with this, or are they still 
kicking tires?  I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's 
most important, especially since I'm on the road.  Do we want to continue 
marketing the sites during the time period between signing and termination?  
I don't think 3 weeks would be a problem after signing.  No TurboPark!!!

On the issue of the conference call Friday, I have a meeting with the 
customer which starts in the am, then I'm on the road.  Monday would be 1000 
times better, if this is at all possible.  In that won't work, I will have 
more details about timing of my Friday meeting tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

I  checked all my emails, and I don't have any indication that I 
received/reviewed this version of the document.  The redline is the redline 
against the last version I have on file.  If the other folks sign before it 
has been reviewed internally, it is possible that changes will be required.  
It won't be extensive.

I will ask Karen Way to call me before making changes to drafts, or at least 
advising me via email so that things will flow more smoothly.

Kay,

I don't get why we're changing this document at this time.  This deal has 
already been signed by the landowner and Herman said it was o.k. as it 
stood.  
The only thing we decided to do was keep track of our renewal option since at 
the time it comes up we will exceed the 5% deal. 

Kay Mann
01/30/2001 01:10 PM
I ran a redline from the last version I had electronically. 

I've forwarded the current version to Herman for his review and approval.  
Due to some of the changes, Enron may need some revisions as well.

Kay

This should be good enough.

Thanks,

Kay

Ben Jacoby has asked me to follow up with you on the GE LM 6000 LOCs.  

I have been in contact with GE, asking them to reissue the E-Next Generation 
LOCs in the names of the appropriate project companies.  In order to do this, 
GE requested that we send them the original  LOCs.  Upon receipt of the 
originals, GE also requested a letter from E-Next Generation cancelling the 
original LOCs.  

After discussing the matter with Catherine Clark in Global Finance, she and 
Lisa Bills advised me that the best way to do this was to write a letter from 
ENA as Agent for E-Next Generation, cancelling the original LOCs.  I have 
composed this letter, and I am waiting for Ben Jacoby to approve/sign it 
before I send it to GE.  Once GE receives the letter, they will have Chase 
reissue the LOCs, which will then be sent directly to the new beneficiaries, 
Fountain Valley Power, L.L.C. and CA Development I and II, L.L.C.

Kay

I need the appropriate address, contact name, and phone number for CA 
Development I and II.

Ben

I left the letter mentioned above on your desk on Friday.  Have you had a

And what would that be..... who has the papers prepared and signed to
date????

Kay.Mann@enron.com on 07/18/2000 09:09:38 AM

I vote for them to do whatever needs to be done.

hashworth@technip.com on 07/18/2000 08:49:03 AM

Yes, STILL here, definitely the strangest of all!
We need to file a current and final franchise tax report, public info
report, and obtain certificate of good standing.  Also certificates of
dissolution.  I seem to remember some of this being done???
CT will charge $172 per entity if they prepare the certificate of
dissolution and file it and $134  per if they file only.  As I remember
there is a TX Corporation and two TX limited partnerships that need to be
dissolved.  Price is the same whether it is a corp or partnership.
I talk to Jennifer Miller at CT fairly often and one of her team members
told me that they could do it on a Technip order and just bill Anglers, so
let me know what if anything you want them to do.
Hope all is well with everyone.
Talk to you soon.

Amen.

Kay:

Here are my comments on the draft Kendall SPA:

1.  I assume that we are preparing a separate SPA for Kendall New Century 
Development, LLC and Titan Land Development Company, LLC.  I will deliver a 
project binder on Titan to your office this morning.  

2.  Section 2.1 Purchase Price:  The Purchase Price in the Kendall SPA should 
be $3,000,000.00.  The Purchase Price in the Titan SPA should be 
$6,000,000.00.

3.  Section 2.2 Termination Date:  I would like to propose March 15, 2001 as 
a [Kendall]Termination Date.  If PSEG and ENA can agree on the form of the 
document and sign within the next  2-3 weeks, that would leave a 3 week 
window prior to the Termination Date.  This seems like plenty of time to 
arrange the wire transfer and set-up the transfer of the member interests. 
(Do you see any problem with this timeline?).

4.  Section 7.1(b) Purchaser Indemnification:  The agreements states 
$3,500,000.  Shouldn't this number be $3,000,000 (equal to the Purchase 
Price).

5.  Page A-2:  The Purchaser signature block currently reads Coastal Power 
Corporation.  This should read [Purchaser].

 I would like to deliver the Kendall SPA to PSEG as soon as possible.  Please 
forward me an [Kendall] electronic version once the changes have been made. 
Let me know the timing on a draft SPA for Titan LLC. 

Thanks,
Fred

Funny joke

Opps.  I thought we were talking about the same CO.  Could you please send 
me  a copy (or electronic file) of the letter you are incorporating by

This CO will need to be signed by Janet Dietrich, Managing Director.

Is the replacement N-1 the same as the replacement N-1 in CO #2?

I'll give this the final once over as soon as I get the letter.

This past Wednesday during our weekly site visit, I explained to Austin 
Energy that I could not give them the whole LM6000 contract for 
confidentiality reasons, especially with respect to the commercial 
sections.   They were okay with that, but did make one last (and polite) 
request for a list of the scope items that they would be getting.  What I 
would propose to send is Exhibit B and B-1 from the contract (see attached).  
Exhibit B is a simple bulleted scope of supply list.  Exhibit B-1 is a simple 
spec that we wrote for the turbine which is itself a glorified scope document.

Let me know if this is something that I can forward to Austin Energy.  If the 
attached document still gives someone heartburn, I'll end it here and 
politely decline with Austin Energy.

Thanks,

Eric-

I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those changes 
are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 
as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to 
exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they 
typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it 
anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined 
cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, 
then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and 
their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust 
guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.

Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to 
your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I 
therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a 
separate word file. 

Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in my 
hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something from 
GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.  

If you have questions, give me a call.  (67550)  I will be in Ausitn 
Wednesday and Thursday, but will be available by cell phone (713) 412-6873.

John Moore told me today that we are in the market for locating 3 or 4

obtaining options.  I have been asked to set up a special purpose company

sets the standard for doing business in the new economy.  Congratulations to 
all of you for making it happen.

Enron placed No. 18 overall on Fortune's list of the nation's 535 "Most

Gentlemen,

This was my first written request for a cost plus contract.  The request was 
made to NEPCO because at that time NEPCO was supposedly still involved in the 
project. I left subsequent voice mails for Dave and John Schwartzenburg, then 
mailed a follow up email to the gang at noon on Thursday, February 1st, 
copying various folks at EECC.  John Schwartzenburg was out of town, but went 
out of his way to accommodate my request so that by Thursday evening, I had a 
form from EECC. I worked over the weekend to adapt the form to this project, 
and forwarded it to EECC on Monday.  I received no response to the revised 
draft.

I have recently heard that the EECC form that I spent worked on is being 
scrapped, and we are starting over.  Is this true?

Hi David, 

The owner is willing to do this cost plus.  Do you have a cost plus form that 
you like?  

It was good to see you yesterday, by the way.  

Do you want me to include you on follow up emails on this?

in my opinion adequately addressed by John Schwartzenburg.  
I am frustrated with beginning the process over again.

Gentlemen,

As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which 
has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power 
plant.  We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and 
since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use 
something that is acceptable to NEPCO.  I will then take the laboring oar in 
order to get a working draft prepared for this project.

As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Question: Are the GE performance guarantees completely voided by the use of 
inlet chillers?  The first sentence in the first bullet point concerns me.

I'm not sure how the stuff included in the second series of bullet points 
fits in.  Are these changes in scope, suggestions, conditions?

I think we would be better off increasing the length of the change order to 
include the pertinent stuff, but not attaching the letter as a reference.

One thing to put on the list (which may be there all ready) is that we want 
our officers/directors to effectively resign at closing.  

Another detail (and note who is getting this email):  I've had three 
instances recently where agreements have been forwarded to the counterparty 
prior to legal review.  As much as I hate to suggest this, it may be best to 
have the drafts forwarded to Enron Legal before the commercial team receives 
the docs.

Carlos:

We have enclosed the initial draft of a Purchase Agreement pertaining to
Kendall New Century Development LLC.  Also enclosed is a blacklined copy
marked to reflect revisions to the form of agreement initially furnished to
us.  We are continuing to review the Purchase Agreement, and may wish to
suggest additional revisions; however, we have attempted to expedite the
review process by circulate a draft today.  We wish to call to your
intention several matters which may warrant further consideration:

1.  Please advise whether Enron has any outstanding guaranties or
performance bond type obligations in connection with the Kendall Project.
If so, we will want to add appropriate provisions addressing the replacement
of such guaranties and/or performance bonds by the Purchaser.

2.  We anticipate that the Purchaser will require some type of
representation as to balance sheet information (i.e., a description or
listing of assets and liabilities) of the Company.  We have not yet drafted
this representation, as it would be helpful to know what type of information
is available, and what type of representation Enron is willing to make in
this regard.

3.  The first sentence in Section 6.3 (the covenant pertaining to Project
Obligations) seems rather unusual, as it is more typical for the Seller to
be subject to such restrictions rather than the Purchaser.  However, since
it appears to have been deliberately drafted in this manner, we have not
attempted to revise this provision, and we await guidance on whether
revision would be acceptable to Enron.

Please review the enclosed and advise of any comments or questions.  In the
meantime, if we may be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
call.  Thank you.

Just use a regular CA (yes, I changed my mind), describe as a power 
generation transaction (no equipment reference).

Thanks,

kay

   
	
	

Kay,

I have been asked to do three or more additional CA's for equipment:

Chris Booth is dealing with a broker for the potential sale of three 
different kinds of turbines (end buyer unknown at this time).  I guess we 
would need a CA for the broker, then CA's with potential buyers.

Fred Mitro needs a CA for Ryan Company and another for Panda Energy.  (Fred, 
do you know what kind of turbines these companies are looking at?).

We did the attached CA for NRG ("...in connection with discussions concerning 
a proposed [power generation project using a single General Electric 8EA.") 
and might be a good form for these new CA's.

Please advise.

Kathleen

I don't think we need the language, especially since the guarantees won't 
apply to retrofitting the plant later.

I would recommend that we not insert Eric's comments regarding the
exhaust temperature and energy guarantees for combined cycle facilities.
As Eric indicates, this is a simple cycle plant, which is similar to
Fountain Valley.  When commenting on the Fountain Valley agreement, Lee
recommended that all references to exhaust temperature and energy
guarantees be stricken and we did so.  In addition, Lee has already seen
a version of the City of Austin agreement that had Sections 10.4.1 and
10.4.3 (the sections Eric would like to reinstated) stricken. Let me
know what you think, but I recommend we leave them out, particularly if
such sections are not necessary and would only be useful to have in the
future if the plant ever went combined cycle.

Here's what Eric wrote:

I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those
changes
are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and
10.4.3 as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were
related
to exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant
and
they typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would
guarantee
it anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes
combined
cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that
out, then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and
10.4.4
(and their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust
guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.

Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached
to
your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I
therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a
separate word file.

Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in
my
hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something
from GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.

Ben Jacoby is having an offsite Friday at the Hyatt for the East Development 
group to discuss 2001.  He has asked me (and I think Roger) to sit in. I'm 
planning on attending.

I'm sure either or both of you are welcome, although it won't be a problem if 
you don't attend.

Kay

By the way, what do you think of having Rob or someone OBS the Coyote Springs 
contract so we can use it as a starting point?  That would give me something

Ed/Kay - Here is a brief description of what I am trying to accomplish with 
the confidentiality agreement.  enovate, L.L.C. currently has no direct 
employees, but rather employees of Peoples Energy Resources Corp. (wholly 
Secondly, I need your legal opinion as to the realistic enforceability of 
such an agreement and what form that enforcement might take or whether the CA 
only serves as a scare tactic.  The reason being, there is a Peoples employee 
that I think is in the process of looking for another job.  He is also the 
one that I am most concerned about sharing confidential information.  
Therefore, I am hoping to force his hand and see his reaction to the CA.

Kay has a large amount of history with our business and other CA's that have 
been thrown back and forth.  Perhaps the two of you can coordinate the 
handling of this CA.  I am trying to put something in Peoples' hands end of

Brian,

I didn't get the revised draft.

Kay:  I have edited the draft you sent me and placed GE's comments in a 
different color so you can see their comments next to yours.  Risk Management 
(Paul Parrish) is OK with the 100% coverage.  The original deal was that they 
would be off the hook for cosmetic damage incurred by GE's storage, so to put 
them back on the hook was a bit of a retrade.  Otherwise I think their 
comments (other than the approval of the assignment comment) are in order.

Is this draft acceptable to you?

Brian,

The following are our comments to the subject change order.  If you like, we
can set up a time to discuss these comments.  As I mentioned on the phone,
many of the comments directed at Part 1, Item 1 are due to the fact I do not
have a signed copy of Consent to Assignment.  I am searching for a copy at
this end, but if you have ready access, a copy would be appreciated.

Part I

1.  The base contract defines the party GE is contracting with as the
"Purchaser".  LJM2is the Purchaser under the base contract. I understand
assignment of the contract by LJM2 to E-Next is under consideration and was
supposed to have occurred in December. I do not have a copy of the Consent
signed by GE or any other signed documents indicating that the assignment
has taken place.  Assuming the assignment has taken place, according to the
Revision 5 to the Change Order does not quite succeed in making the
correction.  It should say "... between General Electric Company ("Seller")
and E-Next Generation LLC ("Purchaser") dated May 31, 2000 (the
2.1  Delete the added language that begins with the words "on or prior to
the Guaranteed Unit Shipment Date(s)...".  Because Unit No. 1 is going to
storage and the customer controls when it is released from storage and when
it gets to the jobsite, the risk of late delivery originally assigned by the
contract to GE has shifted to the customer.  This is recognized in section
5.5.2 of the contract which states that if GE is directed to ship to
storage, for the purpose of assessing LDs and final payment, GE's delivery
obligation is deemed fulfilled.  The original guaranteed delivery dates are
no longer relevant. If the Unit 1 equipment is close enough to being ready
for delivery that it must be shipped to storage because the customer cannot
take possession of it, it does not matter if we ship to storage before or
after the contract delivery dates.

2.2  The comment to 2.1 applies to this paragraph also.  Further, there is
no guaranteed delivery date for non-Major Components as long as delivery of
that equipment does not impede the continuous progress of installation.

2.4  Delete the words "unless caused by Seller or its Subcontractor" at the
end of this paragraph. Otherwise, the paragraph first takes a responsibility
away from GE and then re-imposes it.  As I understand it, there is a
significant possibility that some cosmetic deterioration to external
surfaces will occur to the equipment while it is in storage.  This is a
function of the storage conditions and GE is responsible for those
conditions.

2.6  Delete in its entirety the second sentence which reads "Passage of
title and warranty obligations of Seller with respect to the Unit 1
Equipment remain unchanged under the Agreement".  Article 5.5.2 makes it
clear that Purchaser's direction to place equipment into storage causes
title to pass and delivery for the purposes of LDs and final payment to
occur even though Purchaser has not taken physical possession of the stored
equipment.  5.5.2 also indicates that all expenses incurred by Seller as the
result of placing equipment into storage shall be payable by Purchaser.
These expenses include any extension of the Primary Warranty Period that
results from storage.  The deleted sentence should be replaced by: "The
parties agree that the Primary Warranty Period for Unit 1 Equipment placed
into storage shall be determined in accordance with Article 14.1.1 of the
Agreement except that the Primary Warranty Period shall end for the gas
turbine and generator no later than March 11, 2004 and for the balance of
the Unit 1 Equipment on March 31, 2004 unless extended by mutual agreement."

2.10  We will insure the equipment to 100% of its purchase price.  The
policy in place will have a $300,000 deductible, for which GE will be
responsible.

2.11  Seller's responsibility for both damage and loss, not just loss,
should pass to Purchaser.

The rest of the changes are acceptable.

Regards,

Jeff
 

Hi.

I don't think I would have Rob participate in the call.    Just doesn't feel 
right.

I haven't heard any feedback from this morning's conference call.  Have you?

I have sent it to Rob - I can get you something back for the call - for 
instance, the assignment language and the "relationship of the parties" kind 
of stuff.  

Is that what you mean?  Rob was not planning to be on the call, but I may be 
able to twist his arm - plus, my meeting will probably take only 1/2 hour, so 
I could perhaps join you.

Rose

ok.  I thought it was a lot to ask.

   
	
	

Actually, we are in the process of faxing you the information on the three 
companies.  Also, we would like to delete the first sentence of Section 5.  
We do not, in the ordinary course of business keep tracking records of all of 
the confidential information that we receive.  It will be maintained in our 
project files and will be available to be returned, but we do not keep 
separate records.  Thanks for your consideration.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignme=
nt=20
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=
,=20
and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=
ne=20
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.

Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=

the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=

Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=

Hi,

Things are going just fine here.  I'm looking forward to spring - baseball 
and gardening.  I want more weather like last weekend.

I was in NYC last week.  I managed to get lost walking around Midtown.  I 
know, that's impossible.  I was talking on my cell and walking.  I walked 
from Bloomingdale's to somewhere east and slightly north of the theater 
district.  Oh, I should add I was headed to the Omni at 52nd and Madison.  
When I realized I was walking downhill with only warehouses ahead, it clicked 
that I was off track.  My feet hurt so badly when I got back I could hardly 
stand it.

Are you going to spring training this year? 

Gotta get back to work. Thanks for writing.

Kay

Enron Law Conference
2001

May 2-4, 2001
Westin Riverwalk
San Antonio, Texas

Look for RSVP forms the end of February via e-mail.

_______________________________________________________________________

Scooped me on Ray.  I like him.

I heard Debbie Chance is transferring to another group, and that Reagan is 
going to be an originator (not a developer).

   
	
	

that Ray Hoppe is leaving (if not already gone)?  Think he is going to Duke.

K-

Here is  a draft for your review, and if you think appropriate, distribution 
to NJR.

Please let me know if you want changes made.

Kay

Brian Barto might have the info also.  I left Brian a voice mail and asked 
him to call you or me back with the info.  He is pretty bad about returning 
phone calls, though.

Kay

I just sent him another email with the document attached.  If I don't hear 
from him, I will definitely give him a call.  Cutting out those 2 columns did 
nothing for the length of the document, so the print is still small to fit on 
one page.  I think it's readable because I can see it!

	Kay Mann@ENRON
	07/18/2000 02:09 PM
		
It might work better if you call. Steve is very nice.

I've sent several emails trying to find out Cheryl's last name and Jeff 
Darst's information with no response.  I'll try again.

Same city, different Westin.  This one is on the Riverwalk, the other was 
near the Hyatt.  I like San Antonio for the trip though.  Easy!

Busy as usual.

Love,

Kay

Good morning sweetie. How did it go this morning?
The law conference in May looks nice. Isn't that where it was last year?
Gota go. John wants to talk to me. Love, NM  

I'm getting hourly updates.  I haven't talked to John today.  Carlos tell you 
about the security guard by HR?

   
	
	

Debbie went to Paper.  And I was wondering why Reagan has been "full of 
himself" lately.

Carlos filled me in on the stuff "over yonder".  My, My, My.

Hi.

How's it going?

Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a 
little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.

The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know 
if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.

I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.  I 
figure you guys have lots of "guy only" stuff coming up, but there aren't a 
lot of "mom/son" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a 
Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.

Love,

ckm

Could you check out the sitter thing?  We could drop off Michael and take the 
Enron Field shuttle.  I don't need to stay late - I'm sure 2 hours would do 
it.

I would like to go to the Enron booth but it's truly your call. I bet we can
get Choc to help but I need to call her asap...
That's neat about the head of the PTL group.
I think you should do some mom and son stuff with Michael. Your right about
me and a large group of people on a boat...
love, NM

I think I misspoke (or miswrote).  The change I suggested would belong in 
both versions.

Pardon the delay, but I inadvertently left you off the email.

He's going to be at the birthday party or at Matt's.  Maybe we should drop 
him off.

Sweetie, how do you want to set it up?  NM

   Fine.  Should I pick him up at school or what?

Choc,
Could you keep Michael for a short time tomorrow, say 7 -10? Kay was invited
to the Enron booth at the Bar B Q and thinks she would like to go. Thanks,

Accomplishments: I haven't jumped out the window yet, or slapped/cursed 
anyone from any other Enron entity.  This is significant in a way that not 
all would understand.  Vision & Values.

My other significant accomplishment was the LM 6000 deal: revising the 
structure, figuring out how to sell the WestLB stuff to GE/S & S,  and 
closing it in a relatively short period of time.

More to come!

As for vacation, I'll scatter some days off here and there, but I don't have 
any plans for consecutive days off. 

Kay

FYI.
Brian D Barto@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
07/17/2000 09:27 AM
What I was told by your secretary and Marty was that ENA was keeping one of 
the signed originals, and I picked up the other to give to Schroeder.  I do 
not exactly know where ENA's original went.  Lets ask Marty.

I thought that someone retrieved the originals (which has been signed by GE 
but not Enron) while I was in Ft. Worth for my dad's surgery. Marty mentioned 
that you were looking for them, so I thought  he had given them to you (he's 
out this week).  I have not seen the termination agreement since I returned. 
Did you and John leave fully executed termination agreements in my office?  
Maybe someone else picked them up.  

I can't tell you what's going on with the assignment.  Perhaps Peggy Banczak 
can help out with that.

Kay

Brian D Barto@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
07/17/2000 08:00 AM
Schroeder and I left two signed originals with you, so what does "processed" 
mean.  Yes, thankyou for asking, GE has received their fully executed 
original, and therefore should be prepared to issue the invoice to 
Purchaser.  But I have not seen the invoice yet.

What is the status of the assignment of the GE contract to Mitsui?  Did the 
invoice go to them?

I haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk.  I 
just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is the form of option agreement for the Schaeffer option which 
passes muster.  The changes are relatively minor, but have significance from 
an accounting and legal perspective.

Kay

Looks good to me.

I think it is fine to send it to Lee and Kent.

Chris,

Your invoice for December reflects final revisions to the documents through 
December 20th, so I'm assuming the draft the Schaeffer's signed was done 
subsequent to anything transmitted on December 13th.   However, emailing 
documents directly to me and calling me on the phone will be a big help.

Thanks for your response,

Kay

Kay -- 

I understand that we have received your revisions to the Schaffer Option
Agreement and are in the process of incorporating them into the document.
We will then contact the Schaffers' attorneys and get the changes
incorporated.

We apologize for the confusion regarding the last set of revisions.  Those
revisions arose following our teleconference with the Schaffers' attorneys.
Apparently, Don was acting under the assumption that you were tied up on
other matters and had coordinated with Stuart, Fred and Rusty.
Nevertheless, you should be able to find a copy in your electronic file
attached to a December 13, 2000 email from Fred.  Although Don had
subsequent conversations with Rusty and Stuart, we should have circled back
with you.

In the future, we will ensure that you receive email copies of all of the
documents, with the changes highlighted as you requested.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this matter
further. 

Thank you.

How many times do I have to say EMAIL IT?
Kay: 
Just to clarify.  The "blacklined changes" in the fax I sent to you come
directly from the document that you sent to us yesterday.  We will let you

Do you remember anything about this agreement?  It was something people were 
looking for while I was in Fort Worth, and now I'm trying to find the signed 
original.

Thanks,

Kay

What I was told by your secretary and Marty was that ENA was keeping one of 
the signed originals, and I picked up the other to give to Schroeder.  I do 
not exactly know where ENA's original went.  Lets ask Marty.

I thought that someone retrieved the originals (which has been signed by GE 
but not Enron) while I was in Ft. Worth for my dad's surgery. Marty mentioned 
that you were looking for them, so I thought  he had given them to you (he's 
out this week).  I have not seen the termination agreement since I returned. 
Did you and John leave fully executed termination agreements in my office?  
Maybe someone else picked them up.  

I can't tell you what's going on with the assignment.  Perhaps Peggy Banczak 
can help out with that.

Schroeder and I left two signed originals with you, so what does "processed" 
mean.  Yes, thankyou for asking, GE has received their fully executed 
original, and therefore should be prepared to issue the invoice to 
Purchaser.  But I have not seen the invoice yet.

What is the status of the assignment of the GE contract to Mitsui?  Did the 
invoice go to them?

I haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk.  I 
just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed.

Thanks,

Kay

Gentlemen,

Attached for your review is a draft of the letter of intent.

Please let me know if you have any difficulty opening this document.

Kay

I'm leaving now.

Are you ok to leave to pick up Michael? If not let me know and I can do it,
no problem.
Love, NM

Fred,

When you need something for a project, please come to me first (or whoever 
might be the appropriate ENA lawyer).  Going directly to the outside lawyer 
creates problems. For instance, it is Enron policy that we do  not pay 
outside counsel for work not referred to them by an ENA lawyer.  

Thanks,

Details on the two Agreements Rusty mentioned in his Pontiac presentation are 
as follows:

1.  Tax Assessment Letter - Livingston County personell (Pontiac site) have 
requested that Titan LLC enter into a tax assessment agreement related to the 
Project.  Mark Gershon (Piper Rudnick) is preparing a draft letter for the 
County using the Assessment Agreement form utilized in our Kendall County 
Special Use Permit as a template and based upon discussions between myself, 
Rusty, Mark, and Warren Schick/Robert Tillota of ENA's tax department.  Mark 
will forward a draft of this letter to us for review/comment before we submit 
it to Livingston County.  Please co-ordinate with Mark directly in order to 
minimize the outside legal costs of this Agreement.

2.  ComEd Interconnection Agreement - ComEd recently (1/30/01) sent me their 
boilerplate draft Interconnection Agreement (IA) for the Kendall LLC and 
Titan LLC projects.  Under ComEd's tariff we have 90 days to execute the IA 
in order to maintain our position(s) in ComEd's interconnection queue.  I 
have told ComEd that we would likely modify their boilerplate IA to make it 
resemble the IA signed by ENA and ComEd in Q2 2000 on the Des Plaines LLC 
project in Will County, Illinois.  My preference would be to wait a few weeks 
on starting negotiations on either IA so that we can attempt to finalize a 
sale of member interests with either  PSEG or Entergy.  If you would like to 
see the ComEd boilerplate IA, let me know and I will forward it to you.

Call me to discuss.

I have your rodeo tickets.  The total is $114.  

Kay

My only advice is to be very specific in their scope.  These guys run up 
bills worse than anyone.

I briefly glanced at the PMRW update on the Illinois projects and what jumped 
out at me was their indication that they'd be working with Andrews & Kurth on 
the due diligence for Livingston and Kendall projects.  I presume this is a 
mistake on their part as the reference should be to King & Spalding.  Before 
they get started on their due diligence for us, they are waiting to get a fax 
from me which I going to send this morningIand I will point that correction 
them (presuming that my understanding is correct.)

FYI:  another instance of  work being sent directly to outside counsel.  In 
this case it was an additional assignment related to an ongoing project.

Previous correspondence on the topic of assignment to outside counsel.  See 
10/10 email from me below.

Fred,

I think Kathleen will be a big help to all of us in improving the flow of 
paper.  I trust her to work up initial drafts of option agreements, subject 
to my quick review and the review of local counsel.  

Thanks for your cooperation.

The Fehrs and Ledfords did sign their respective option agreements last week 
prior to our Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.  I am expecting Karen Way to 
forward you an executed original copy of each agreement.  I will check with 
her on the status of this.

With regard to the policy, I understand your point.  Rusty and I will work to 
better co-ordinate with you in the future.  Perhaps we can lever off of 
Kathleen for agreements such as the Schaeffer option.

Let me know.

Fred

   
	
	

Hi Guys,

Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go 
through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.  In the 
future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to 
the process.

Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?

Thank you,

Kay
Kay:

This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
(312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.

Hi there,

Any comment?

Thanks,

lee.johnson@ss.ps.ge.com on 02/12/2001 10:44:39 AM
Kay,

The guaranteed performance values in section 10 have been edited, & I'm not
sure why.

I'm not sure who to go to on the Technical side of your team.  Maybe Eric
Booth can explain, but months ago Bruce Golden and I discussed whether the
guarantee values should be revised for site conditions. The decision was
made that a site  specific guarantee was not needed, that it would be
acceptable to correct for the difference in elevation (sea level to 435 ft)
and exhaust losses (6" to 12" backpressure).  

I'd prefer to stay the course.  However, if there is now a compelling reason
to change, I'd like to request the guarantee based on the revised basis
conditions given in Appendix A and verify these performance values.    (We
don't have a record of supplying these numbers.) Our guarantee process
usually takes several days to a week, depending on the backlog of requests
in house.

Please let me know asap.

Thanks,

Lee

 

    
   Pursuant to Kay Mann's instructions, attached please find a
clean copy of the most recent version of the City of Austin Agreement
(the second document below), as well as a blackline showing changes from
the last version circulated on December 14.  The Agreement deletes
references to specific performance guarantees for combined cycle plants.
The Agreement now has the exhibits rolled in. To complete the agreement,
we need to include the date of execution, the addresses and contacts for
Sections 25.1 and 25.3, and Exhibit H-2.  
 <<CRO- City of Austin/GE Facility Agreement Versions 3 to 4.DOC>>

Brian Barto might have the info also.  I left Brian a voice mail and asked

phone calls, though.

Kay

I just sent him another email with the document attached.  If I don't hear 
from him, I will definitely give him a call.  Cutting out those 2 columns did 
nothing for the length of the document, so the print is still small to fit on 
one page.  I think it's readable because I can see it!

I've sent several emails trying to find out Cheryl's last name and Jeff

Lee,

I've forwarded your email to Eric, and have asked for his response.  The 
changes were his.

Thanks,

Kay

ps  Thanks for the invite Friday.  We had a great time.

Hi Mark,

Here's the latest, incorporating the "arrange for" approach on the EPC and 
O&M.

Kay

Good morning,

Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits 
today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.

So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard 
looks. 

I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is 
looking better, though.

Hope you are having a good day.

Love,

ckm

fyi, we have staff meetings on the first and third Wednesdays, at 130.  The 
meetings usually last an hour or less.

ckm

Did anything get set up?  I'm booked at 200, but otherwise available.

Kay

Please let me know your availability for Monday, February 12, 2001 for an 
hour to discuss both the attached document and new changes with EEC/NEPCO.  

Also, please note on your calendars, a meeting on Thursday, February 15, 2001 
from 11:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in 3AC4C1. Lunch will be provided.

 

Please get back to me with your availability as soon as possible. 

Thank you,

Please draft a letter to the guy listed in the first email below (Hartzell at 
ITM), using the stuff in Chris' email as the body of the letter.  Save under 
General LOI, and I'll finish the letter.

Thanks,

Kay or Kathleen,

I would appreciate your advise.

Thanks,

P.S. Here is the comission language.

David:

We are very interested in working with you on a nonexclusive basis regarding 
the disposition of certain equipment we own. To the extent you identify a new 
prospective buyer that we are not already working with, and we close a 
transaction with that buyer, we will pay you a commission of 0.6% of the 
transaction value. Of course, we cannot provide any assurance that any 
transaction will be consummated, as any transaction we enter into will be 
subject to a variety of approvals including but not limited to Enron senior 
management approval.

We look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,

Chris Booth
Chris,

The only problem I have with the CA is that I believe section 7 is in
conflict with the confirming email on the commission. Other wise, I do not
think that I have any problems.

Kay - have you had any chance to give this some thought?  We are about to

finalized. Let me know.  Also, I am trying to get back on the Intercompany 
loan stuff.  I am going to be in Houston next week and have Wednesday pretty 
open.  Are you going to be in town?  If so, maybe we could get together for 
half hour or so to go over the loan stuff.

It looks like your memory serves you well.  Section 6.8.2 allows the Managing 
Member to designate officers of enovate.  I revised the original appointment 
declaration you prepared to reflect Laura as VP.  Take a look at it and let 
me know if it works.  If so, I will probably ask you to have Janet execute it 
at your convenience.  

Thanks - Gregg

FYI. I have jury duty on Wednesday, Feb 14.  

Kay

Hopefully you will get some credit for it, also.

I just love Lisa.  I think she's a ton of fun.

I will just put you out all day as jury duty.  I haven't been called in a few 
years, I'm sure my time is coming.

Looks like it is ok to keep the same.

How's the GE master form agreement coming along?  When do you think we will 
have a draft?

Thanks,

Kay
	
	

Kay-

Lee is correct, I'm the one that marked up the performance section.  Since we 
were writing a breakout agreement for Austin, I thought I would make it apply 
to site specific performance as well.  Thought it might be helpful.  However, 
I was not aware of the agreement that Bruce and Lee had.  If Lee really wants 
to keep the original guarantee, I can live it.

Kay:

I talked with PSEG this morning.  PSEG would like to negotiate and sign a 
binding LOI regarding the Kendall project site in Illinois prior to 
negotiating and executing the Definitive SPA.  The specifics of this LOI are:

 PSEG would pay an up-front $300,000 payment to ENA 
 This payment would be non-refundable unless PSEG discovered a "fatal flaw" 
in the project (we will have to carefully define this concept)
 The binding LOI would establish a date by which the SPA would be executed or 
PSEG would forfeit the up-front payment
 The $2.7 MM balance of the Purchase Price would be due upon closing (signing 
the SPA and transferring the member interests).

I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC 
with another Buyer before they get their act together.

Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI.  I would like to 
strike on PSEG while they are anxious and motivated.  My goal is to send the 
LOI to PSEG by Wednesday of this week.  I can work directly with Carolyn if 
that is the most efficient approach.

Fred

Fred,

Sounds "do able".  Please contemplate what would be acceptable as "outs" for 
them and for us.  A,lso, will you be getting RAC involved soon since we are 
contemplating a binding agreement in the near future?

My best guess is that the LOI will be prepared in house, but I will discuss 
this with Carlos, and we will advise K & S of their role.

Hi Pete,

We want the GE form to be on an individual turbine basis.  As for work 
priorities, I would put it in front of the City of Austin agreement.

and Bobby have been pleased with theirs, but maybe they've just been lucky.

Mitsubishi isn't attractive to me, but I don't know why.  I really can't 
think of much unless I go back to the idea of the small Lexus.  The big one 
is just too expensive.  I don't want a Ford (that knocks out a lot), you 
don't like the 4 Runner, and the Land Cruiser is too expensive also. 

I don't remember being particularly impressed with either the Yukon or the 
Tahoo.

What else is there?

ckm

Good morning! Hope your day is going well.

I spoke with John and Marc (area mgr) and both said they would not buy
another Durango. Both said they have rescued their spouse more than once.
Maybe we should look at something else. John is driving a Montero by
Mitsubitshi that he likes a lot.

I'm taking an early lunch so I can beat the crowd to the PO.

Maybe we should have the GE call on Thursday, or maybe Friday am.

Poor baby!  At least it is only twice a year, or in her case, this one last 
time.

I think I may take him fishing with my dad and mom in Palacios.  He really 
loves it, and my dad is in declining  health, but can still get around.  I 
hate to waste the opportunitty to let them spend time together.

ckm

That's what I was thinking too!  Let me check calendars and send out an email

Did you find something for you and Michael to do on spring break?  Ruthie is 
STILL in heat!  Bless her heart, she's been bleeding 13 days!

I ate at the Met, so I had a big lunch.  Fridge foraging is fine.

I would get the stone delivered as early as possible, so that I can pace 
myself.  Bob said he ordered 1700 pounds, if I am remembering correctly.  
Guess I should go look.

ckm

Wow, I just got this message...
I think we should put the camera out of reach before there's no more film...
I think we should call and have some stone delivered on the 19th. or even
this Saturday. How much do you think we need?
I'm glad your not sore and I think you are doing a great job with the yard.
Eat out of the frig tonight? I'm thinking a sausage wrap and tater
tots...Love, NM

Good morning,

Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits
today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.

So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard
looks.

I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is
looking better, though.

Hope you are having a good day.

Love,

My dad has the same thing as Sheila's mom (athlersclerosis).  He gets tired 
easily, and doesn't walk very well.  But at least he can still walk!  He's 
only 70, but this stuff is progressive.  A long future is unlikely.

Michael adores his PopPop, and March is a nice time of year on the cost.  If 
I'm there I can do a lot of the hard stuff for my dad, which helps.

What kind of vehicle to you have?  I've decided that I need an SUV.

Yes, her appointment to be spayed is now March 15th.  I hope she finishes up 
this week because she's going to the pet hotel on Saturday.  If she's not 
finished, I'm going to get the doctor to look at her.  Poor thing is just 
running out of energy so fast, but then so would I if I had been going that 
long.  I had to go buy her another box of maxi pads!  It's like having a 
daughter!

Oh, I agree, you should let him spend time with your dad.  You never want to 
have any regrets.  What's wrong with your dad.  Is it his heart?  I remember 
him not being well a while back, but I can't remember what is was 
(senility).  I know Emma really misses my mother.

Maybe we should have the GE call on Thursday, or maybe Friday am.

Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a 
Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself 
as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure? 
Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types 
of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle. 
Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on 
modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider 
where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size, 
the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or 
better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too. 
Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with 
electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes 
braking power during a panic stop). 
Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to 
meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood 
of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at 
4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i). 
The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a 
2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The 
four-speed automatic transmission provides a "snow mode" for easy starts on 
slippery surfaces. 
With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully 
independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle 
tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle 
Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and 
is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's 
steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck 
(car?) back under control. 
In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects 
occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point 
seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR), 
front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat 
anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional. 
Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 
60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded. 
Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control, 
tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard. 
Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control, 
remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size 
spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather 
upholstery is available on V6 models. 
Toyota is planning to sell 70,000 Highlanders in calendar year 2001. We'll 
bet demand outstrips supply.

		?EDMUNDS' REVIEW
		
		Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a 
new path to the premium outlet center. Though the exterior may exude that 
tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough 
for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty. 
Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end 
grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked 
against newer competitors. 
		So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui -- the Pathfinder is 
finally energized by a stouter V6, based on the Maxima sedan's stellar 
powerplant. When mated to a five-speed manual transmission, the 3.5-liter, 
DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of 
torque. Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25 
foot-pounds of twist, still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go 
mountain climbing, as well as merge onto freeways without fear. 
		The Pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive, the 
latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged 
at speeds up to 50 mph. On LE models, an automatic All-Mode four-wheel-drive 
system can be specified for 2001, giving you one more reason to skip paying 
the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands. All-Mode operates in 2WD, 
automatic 4WD, 4WD-Hi and 4WD-Lo, all selected using a simple rotary knob on 
the dashboard. 
		We've long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling, 
further enhanced by solid unibody construction. The interior, one of the 
friendliest of any SUV on the market, is spruced up for 2001 with an updated 
instrument panel. A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and 
12-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws. 
		You can choose from three trim levels -- the XE, which for the 2001 model 
year comes with standard power windows, mirrors and locks, and a security 
system; the sporty SE, which gives you a choice of automatic or manual 
transmission along with sporty trim; and the top-of-the-line LE, which 
includes fog lights, Bose audio system, and fake wood accents. 
		All models come standard with 16-inch wheels, full-size spare tire, a CD 
player and ABS. Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in 
leather-wrapped seating, which is available only on SE and LE. Those same 
models, when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic 
transmission, can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system, which 
includes a 6.4-inch flip-down LCD screen, video player, and ports to plug and 
play a PlayStation 2 (And we all know how important that will be after 
Christmas, don't we?). A "Birdview" navigation system, shared with the 
Infiniti QX4, is also available, but we don't recommend it. While the 
"Birdview" perspective is interesting, teensy, tiny, little, itty-bitty 
buttons control the thing, along with some of the climate control functions. 
Get a map. 
		Items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo 
carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet (surprising for what appears to be a 
relatively small vehicle). Some of this space, in our humble opinion, should 
have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations. 
		Despite a few quibbles, we're thrilled that Nissan finally rectified the 
Pathfinder's main problem -- horsepower. With this updated, competitive 
package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of 
the Dodo.

Fred Mitro

Kay:

I talked with PSEG this morning.  PSEG would like to negotiate and sign a 
binding LOI regarding the Kendall project site in Illinois prior to 
negotiating and executing the Definitive SPA.  The specifics of this LOI are:

 PSEG would pay an up-front $300,000 payment to ENA 
 This payment would be non-refundable unless PSEG discovered a "fatal flaw" 
in the project (we will have to carefully define this concept)
 The binding LOI would establish a date by which the SPA would be executed or 
PSEG would forfeit the up-front payment
 The $2.7 MM balance of the Purchase Price would be due upon closing (signing 
the SPA and transferring the member interests).

I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC 
with another Buyer before they get their act together.

Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI.  I would like to 
strike on PSEG while they are anxious and motivated.  My goal is to send the 
LOI to PSEG by Wednesday of this week.  I can work directly with Carolyn if 
that is the most efficient approach.

The travel schedules of the Enron delegation are becoming complicated.  Would 
it be possible for you to travel with us to Richmond tomorrow night?  That 
would give us more flexibility in case we need to convene before the meeting 
on Thursday.  We are staying at the Marriott in Richmond.

uneventful.  Kinda slick, though.

How much does it cost to mail a letter now?  Is is $.34?  Of course I have a

I have no clue how much rock that would be.  I should measure the length of 
the beds, then I could compute how much to get, at least sort of.  There's 
some grass to be dug up also.  I think I will start with the Advil today!

Hi there,

I'm forwarding a draft EPC contract for your review.  This form of contract 
assumes that the equipment will be procurred by the Owner, with the 
understanding that we have not resolved the issue of the timing of the 
procurement of the equipment, and  how it will be procurred.

This is intended to be a discussion draft, and is subject to further Enron 
review and comment.  

Thanks,

Kay

John and Randy,

I got a call from Bob Sevitz regarding a change I made to the EECC revisions 
to the Co Op City EPC contract.  Specifically, I deleted language he had 
added to the waiver of consequential damages.  Bob had added a provision that 
said that the waiver was "subject to" the indemnification section of the 
contract.  I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the 
contractor's point of view.   Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to 
blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.

Just wanted to pass this along.

Jonathan,

Please resend the draft confidentiality agreement for the Public Staff, 
preferably by email.  I cannot locate the document here.

The LOI with Rocky Mount is still under discussion.  In a recent discussion 
with one of Enron's folks the City (or their lawyer) raised the issue that 
Kilpatrick Stockton had represented them in the past, and that there might be 
a potential conflict.  I don't anticipate a problem, but we should discuss it 
soon.

Thank you for your assistance,

Kay

Kay:

   Just a brief note to check on the status of the confidentiality
agreement with the Public Staff.  What did you think of the draft Allyson
and I forwarded by fax last week?  Once that is signed, we can go ahead and
submit Jeffrey Keenan's cost estimates.

   Also, curious as to the status of the LOI and confidentiality
agreement (draft attached to our last e-mail message) with the City of Rocky
Mount.

   Once these documents are finalized, Allyson and I can continue to
move your project forward.  In the meantime, as you know, Allyson has been
drafting resolutions for adoption by local government officials.

Hi Sharon,

Michael will pass on next week's appointment.  He and I have the day off 
together, so I'm making some special rodeo plans.

His winter report from his teachers was good.  He is meeting or exceeding 
expectations in all categories.  We recently visited at school and watched 
him for about an hour, and he was attending very well, sitting still (well, 
relative to the other kids), following instructions, raising his hand to be 
called upon, etc. You should have heard him speak Spanish - it was so cute.  
We visited in the am, and I haven't seen him in the afternoon without meds.  
The class schedule hasn't required an afternoon dose as of yet.

Hope all is well with you.  

Kay

Hi Tana,

A little birdie tells me that you  have a supply of the Energy & Power Risk 
Management Glossary booklets.  Am I getting close? I've found it to be very 
helpful, and I think it would help one of our new lawyers, Carlos Sole.  
Could I get a copy for him?  Any other good power references?

Thanks,

Good afternoon,

We look forward to seeing you soon.

I don't know the dynamic between the Intergen team and Team Coral.  Assuming 
there's no bad blood, I don't suppose it would hurt.  I just don't know 
enough about the situation.

I have jury duty today, by the way.

I'd like to get everyone together for a closing dinner around the 1st of 
March or so to commemorate the closing of the Intergen LM6000 deal. Other 
people I'd like to invite include: Kevin Presto, Janet Dietrich, Lee Johnson, 
Carolyn Campbell, John Keffer, George Kuchbach (sp?), John Jones, Doug 
Pedigo, and Chris Colbert. We can also use this as an opportunity to talk to 
Intergen about other transaction opportunities. Any thoughts on whether we

 Please let me know your availability, and of any restaurant recommendations.

Hi Mark,

I don't know  what these folks are up to.  In fact, I didn't know that Scott 
Laidlaw was involved.  When I spoke with EECC I told them that they needed to 
get direction from you, someone from Mike Coleman's group, or an ENA 
developer.  

Any word from the Co Op/PB team?

numbers of SW people in Houston who can arrange a time and access for the 
insurance adjustor to see the wet SW generator.

and 

Andy Kemsley

I would appreciate it if you would let me know when the inspection is 
arranged and when it to occur. (A telephone call would work best).    I think 
it makes sense for us to have an Enron project management/ technical 
representative present.-  Will you have someone from your office present- it 
might make sense given the  history on this- your call as to the present of 
an Enron RM person being present.   I assume we would have to inform the SW 
point of contact the names of the Enron people.

Anything for the grocery list, my sweetie pie?

You should have seen Michael's eyes while he was riding in that Mercedes 
convertible yesterday.  He was speechless, and you know how rare that is!  I 
suspect we will be hearing about it now...

Kay
Kay,

I am so glad to hear that Michael is doing great at school.  Neil has told
me he loves Marilou's reports that he is attending so well without meds.

He really is a precious boy!  Yesterday you would have thought that "having
poop on one's shoe" was the greatest thing on earth.  He absolutely
delighted in telling ALL of us WHY he was wearing only one shoe!  He was
giggling the whole time!  At the conclusion of the session when he walked
out to Neil, I heard him ask, "Well, how's my shoe doing?"  How do you two
keep from laughing the whole time with him?  Just writing this is making me
laugh!

Have a great time together at the rodeo.   He'll love spending the time with
you!

Sharon

We had a good time.  I always enjoy Ozzie and Heather. Carlos joined us, too. 

Ozzie has a new Mercedes convertible, and he drove me to Michael's babysitter 
to pick him up.  Michael's eyes were the size of saucers!

Rusty,

Here is the form of CA we have used in connection with discussions regarding 
the sale of certain project entities and generation projects.

Rusty,

I will get with Kathleen and we will prepare on a form.  However, you will 
need to provide one of us with the details on a case-by-case basis, so that 
we (Kathleen) can generate the CA's and track them in the legal department 
database.

If we have the following information, a CA can typically be generated on a 
same day basis:

name, address of counterparty, including name of contact person
type of deal contemplated
what type of information is being provided
whether both parties are providing information
whether exclusivity/non-circumvention provisions are desired

Thanks,

Kay

Kathleen / Kay:

As you know, Fred and I are continuing to engage various parties in an 
attempt to sell the Illinois sites.  Scott has asked that we use a CA that 
doesn't preclude States where we have sites he is trying to sell as we are 
collaborating with him on this effort.  He also wants a document in place 
that can cover the sale of equipment.

In talking to Fred, it appears that the Dynegy CA is the latest and greatest 
document that works for this task, however the PSEG deal may also work.  
Please forward me an electronic form that you feel is most appropriate - with 
blanks where all counterparty names are shown - so I can forward them to 
additional parties (such as FPL, Duke, Tenaska, Unicom, etc.).

I would like to get this out to a couple of these parties tomorrow if 
possible since we are already talking to other parties and want to maximize 
price and likelihood of closure.

I instructed PSEG to forward me a copy of their proposed side letter 
addressing a $300K non-refundable deposit and 30 day exclusivity period.  I 
told them that we would look at it and let them know if we viewed it as a 
viable option.  They plan to forward it to us tomorrow along with their legal 
comments on the draft SPA.

I will keep you informed.

Attached is the latest markup on the warranty language which GE is now

has been agreed to on indemnity, LOL, ect. and what we intend to insert into 
the Arcos contract.  FYI I do not intend to use the "end world hunger"

have signed up to with the owner under the EPC contract.

confidentiality agreements, and whether you envision that other 
confidentiality agreements may be necessary or required.

Thanks,

Hi Gregg,

I've sent John an email (didn't have his number).  If you have it I will 
follow up  with a phone call.

I was out yesterday (jury duty called) and Janet was out-of-pocket this 
afternoon.  I'll try to track her down tomorrow.

I will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax, and will 
send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop.

Kay

Kay - just to be my usual pain-in-the-neck self, can you let me know about 
the following:

1-Status of the CA. Did you have a chance to speak with John Nassos?
2-Management appointment.  If Janet signed it, can I get a copy to give to 
Peoples?
3-Intercompany loan document.  I am expecting our balance to increase again 
this month (the 25th to be specific) and I would like to get something put in 
place ASAP to earn a higher return.  If you have a name of a finance 
attorney, I can try to explain what we are trying to accomplish and perhaps 
there is a quicker way to get it done.   I know you were also looking at this 
from a tax perspective.

As always - thanks.

Gregg

As you know, Enron and Peoples jointly own enovate. Our group in Chicago is 
looking to manage some funds which belong to enovate. We had initially 
envisioned having a cash management policy which would outline how Enron 
would invest the funds, etc.  The other owner of enovate, Peoples, has 
proposed that we use the attached document in connection with this 
arrrangement.  This is taking me a little far afield of my area of expertise, 
so I'm writing you guys for input, direction, etc.

Suggestions? Gregg do you want to correct any of what I wrote?

I think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion

From a commercial perspective, I don't have a problem leaving out the 
exercise price during the 30 day option period, so long as our obligation to 
sell is contingent upon the negotiation of a purchase agreement and the 
agreement on purchase price. $300k seems fair for a 30 day exclusivity.

I worked out for the first time in a bizillion years.  Oh my gosh.  At least 
I know how to work out, and I know not to take it to the limit the first time 
out, but it is still hard to move.  I didn't exercise my legs or my back 
much, figuring that's what I'll need most this weekend for yard work.  I 
think I saw our neighbor Kim playing basketball.  I took an abs class, since 
I need to get my abs (and back) in shape to protect myself from injury.  I 
could really mess myself up after such a long hiatus!

The Met was plenty convenient.  They have a  spa there now, with all the spa 
stuff.

John and Fred:

I'd like to get together with you guys next week to discuss the status of the 
unit and what we do from here on out. The deal with Calpine is not 
proceeding, and we need to communicate to ENA management exactly what the 
overall status is of the unit including the generator, and what our action 
plan is to resolve issues with SW and dispose of the unit.

Are you two available Wednesday 3 PM next week? Please advise.

Mike, Ron, Chris, Kay, please advise of your availability as well.

Thanks much,

Ben

James

I received call from Mart T of SW.   Following are two names with telephone 
numbers of SW people in Houston who can arrange a time and access for the 
insurance adjustor to see the wet SW generator.

POC's

Willie Smith

281-604-5240

and 

Andy Kemsley

281-604-5237

I would appreciate it if you would let me know when the inspection is 
arranged and when it to occur. (A telephone call would work best).    I think 
it makes sense for us to have an Enron project management/ technical 
representative present.-  Will you have someone from your office present- it 
might make sense given the  history on this- your call as to the present of 
an Enron RM person being present.   I assume we would have to inform the SW 
point of contact the names of the Enron people.

So when are you leaving today?

Talk to you when you get back.

I'm going to Atlanta tomorrow so I'm going to have to miss our lunch.  I'll
call you to reschedule.

These comments are from our Finance group.  These are FYI at this time; 
further discussions to follow.

Kay
Sheila,
I have reviewed the template GE turbine contract you sent last week from A&K 
as an initial draft for our review.

1. If this is the template, I would like to understand how the "ENA as agent 
for E-Next" language is going to be inserted and what exactly the language 
will say.  With respect to the Agreement in Principle for the turbine for the 
Longview project, the contract states that this template along with Pastoria 
Assignment and Assumption language and override letters will be the basis for 
the final turbine purchase agreeement.  Given that the Pastoria turbine 
contracts had the financing vehicle on the contract as purchaser, with ENA as 
its agent, I'm unclear how the circulated template contract is supposed to 
read for the Longview project and every other turbine purchase contract which 
is being financed by E-Next Generation LLC.

I have noted in the template contract sections which need to be "agentized", 
including the preamble where the question is asked if ENA will always be the 
purchaser - no is the answer for Longview and probably most of the contracts 
ENA wants to enter into with GE.  I will not make those comments here until I 
receive your response to the above.

2. First Recital:  Given that the Facility is defined for a specific project, 
I didn't read anywhere that ENA has the flexibility to use this turbine in 
other projects if it so chooses.  Please advise where I can find this 
flexibility to change venue language.

3. Second Recital:  Where is "GTG" defined?

4. "Owner":  Will this definition always be required that it's not in 
brackets, i.e., that Purchaser and Owner are different parties?

5. Please change definition positions for 1.74 and 1.75 as they are not in 
alphabetical order currently.

6. Cleanup in 6.1.1:  Delete "the" after "of" and before "each" in the 
lead-in.

7. 10.3.2:  In "(f)", change "(e)" to "(g)".
  In "(j)", I don't understand why we would accept it.  If the Purchaser and 
Owner are the same party, I read this subsection to say that GE does not ower 
Takeover LDs - how could this be?  Please advise.

8. 10.15 and certain places thereafter:  Is "TDI" supposed to be a defined 
term?

9. 15.2.1:  In the third sentence, do we want to use the defined term "Import 
Duties"?

10. 17.3(b)(ii):  Why are the licenses, authorizations etc in the second half 
of the subsection to be assignable only to Purchaser (to the extent 
assignable) and not to "Purchaser, or to any person designated by Purchaser 
without any right to compensation not otherwise provided for herein" as the 
lead-in to the subsection states for certain other items to be assigned?

11. Article XIX:  Has David Marshall reviewed this section from both an Enron 
as purchaser and Enron as agent for E-Next perspective?

12. 22.2:  I thought in all our negotiations with GE, that the language we 
used when we assigned the turbine purchase agreements from WestLB to E-Next 
was to be the basis for this contract.  The recent request for Rose to 
provide such language to the team again only reinforces my thought.  Why is 
the old language which does not allow for flexibility in financing methods 
(lenders don't have flexibility to "cash-in" their collateral if Purchaser 
defaults) and has GE listing what reasonable consent is still in this draft?

 Isn't the last paragraph in this section somewhat duplicative with 2.2 but 
more restrictive in stating when a replacement guarantee is required?  Can't 
it be deleted?

13. 27.1:  I realize Limitation of Liability is still being negotiated with 
GE but I don't understand why we would allow them to be liable for less than 
100% of the Purchase Amount especially since they are holding us liable for 
100% of the Purchase Amount.  As with the EPC Contract, the lenders will have 
concern and may not be willing to finance the turbines if GE's LOL is less 
than 100%.
 

Hi Herman,

Here's the agreement I referenced in my voice mail.  We will change it so 
that they can't buy any equipment without further written authorization from 
Enron.  Anything else?

Thanks,

Kay

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Hi!

I was off work yesterday, so I just got your email.  You gotta love 
President's Day.  We went to the rodeo last night, and I'm really tired 
today.  I'm too old to go out on a school night!

Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the 
blockage.  When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled.  
Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.  Sounds dangerous 
to me, but I don't really know anything about it.

Too bad about Katie's asthma.  I was worried that Paige has it, but she went 
through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.  Just really bad 
allergies that make her wheeze.  I'm not sure of the difference, but I 
believe this dr.

Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.  We asked this spring 
and he said not yet.  I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't 
want to push him either.  Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids 
play.  Maybe we can come watch Annie play.

Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week. Everything else is business as 
usual around here.  

Say "hey" to everyone.

Love,

Kay

I think it can be accomplished so long as we have no obligation to agree to 
any particular terms in the definitive docs.  I don't see why we would need 
to DASH exclusivity.

See you soon,

Kay

Isn't that accomplished by having the agreement be simply an exclusivity 
agreement wherein the consideration for the duration of exclusivity is the 
$300k? Fred's checking with credit to see if we need to DASH exclusivity 
(although I find it hard to believe that we would).

Kay Mann@ENRON
02/16/2001 08:41 AM
Gentlemen,

I think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion 
in whether we close, otherwise we have to consider the DASH process at this 
time.

Kay

From a commercial perspective, I don't have a problem leaving out the 
exercise price during the 30 day option period, so long as our obligation to 
sell is contingent upon the negotiation of a purchase agreement and the 
agreement on purchase price. $300k seems fair for a 30 day exclusivity.

Regards,

Ben

Barbara,

Here's the latest word I have on the meeting, which sets it for tomorrow.  Is 
there something later which sets it for today?

Hi Shirley,

Is this meeting still set for tomorrow?  I heard a rumor that it had been 
changed again, but I don't know if it is correct.

Kay

No problem.  I appreciate the help in trying to keep track of it.

Kay

Bronco is on the sofa upstairs.

Good morning!
Boy, it's been non stop since I walked in. Someone broke into Brett's and
Stephen's offices last night. They trashed a lot of offices and stole small
amounts of cash from some employees desks. Nothing really big taken. There
were several laptops out and they found the keys to several cars but left
all of it alone. One of the cars was Nancy Bs new suburban. Doesn't make
sense...

Michael is very concerned about Bronco and that Charlotte won't be able to
find him tonight when they get home.  He is really taken with Bronco...

Gota go.

Just a reminder.

I think Tuesday, 2/27, looks good.

Hmmm.  Very interesting.  I doubt AIG thinks of itself as being in the middle.

Heather Kroll@ECT
02/20/2001 03:07 PM
Thought you'd find this interesting.

Ozzie,

I want to retain the option of keeping Alamac (create a control area), and 
selling New Albany.   From a desk perspective, retaining at least one control 
area is strategically important, and if I can sell New Albany for $175 
million and keep Alamac for $20-30 million, we may want to do that.   

Given the strength in the long term gas market ($4.50 - 5.25/MMBtu over a 15 
year period), it is much easier to hedge the forward value of a coal plant.   
On  the other hand, peakers are literally worth zero on a forward basis, 
given low heat rate forward pricing.

Can we remove AIG from the middle, if necessary?

Pop quiz to follow...

this is going out to a broad group and may not be relevant to some, but 
please be aware that other ENA assets may go into the velocity/condor 
structure at a couple points this year. also we can all pray (i think it is 
ok to use this word in the current political climate and in a secular sense, 
as i think our interests are aligned on this) that the ENE stock price goes 
up and for more room in the raptor vehicle so we may see more raptor hedges.

1.. as most of you are aware, the majority of ENA's merchant assets are in 
our project velocity structure. just to make sure that we confuse everyone, 
we use condor/whitewing/velocity/trutta names interchangeably although 
occasionally there are some distinctions (which i won't bore you with the 
details about so you can disavow all knowledge if you have/need/want to). 
just so you get the right lingo, trutta is the name of the ENA subsidiary 
where these assets now have a home. ENA, under a servicing agreement, is the 
servicer of the assets. i am attaching for your information the servicing 
guidelines in the agreement. the major restriction is that ENA cannot  sell 
assets for less than the contributed value into the structure. any EARLY 
warning of a potential sale of any of these assets would be greatly 
appreciated so we can check whether any restrictions apply and be ready, as 
there are some logistics involved. an email to donna lowry, mary heinitz and 
myself would be wonderful. if you do not do this, you may get on donna's 
list. of course i can't speak for her as to the repercussions envisioned, but 
let me suffice it to say that i am glad i am not on her list. at least that i 
know of.  

2. a number of these assets also have raptor hedges in place in addition to 
being in the velocity structure. only the portion of the investment that was 
on ENA's balance sheet was hedged. if an asset is sold that has been 
"raptorized", the swap will need to be promptly terminated/notional amounts 
adjusted etc. again, give us as much notice as you can.

3. we also need notice (AHEAD OF TIME) of any follow on investments in the 
same merchant assets, exchanges of our interest or further fundings because 
STUFF will have to be done. i will not bore you with the details, but this 
STUFF cannot be done in ONE MINUTE contrary to the popular opinion of some 
business types whose names i will not mention here. we also are obligated to 
provide quarterly reports of the investments which describe any modifications 
to the investments during that calendar quarter. the first report is due 
april 11, 2001 for the first quarter of this year. we will be asking for your 
input with respect to your investments at the end of march.

Hi there,

Could you send me three brochures?  I'm working on getting a couple of 
friends together for a 2-3 night retreat to LAS.  Please send the info to Kay 
Mann, 29 Inverness Park Way, Houston, Texas, 77055.

Thanks,

FYI, we are establishing another structure similar to Velocity to accommodate 
the transfer of non-merchant investments into Condor. [Project Acceleration 
-- catchy name isn't it?] Also, there are some economies of scale here, so 
that it does help to lump some of these things together. In fact, the 
structures are designed to accommodate multiple assets being transferred at 
the same time. [All of this assumes that Condor has the money to buy things.]

this is going out to a broad group and may not be relevant to some, but

Hey, at least you can sew...

How creative!  I wish I knew how to do this sort of stuff.

Speaking of tennis, Michael asked Neil if he can teach him how to play.  Neil 
said no, since he doesn't know how.  I told him I can play, and now Michael 
thinks I should play with him, then he will teach Neil.  Very elaborate plan!

Remember how we used to hit tennis balls against the house?  Can you believe 
we never broke a window?  We have a detached garage, but the door is metal.  
I can't imagine how loud that would be!

I remember trying to encourage Paige to swim, bike, whatever.  Pushing NEVER 
helped.  She can swim and ride, so I guess it worked out ok.  She never 
showed any interest in playing on a sports team, even though she used to go 
to my softball games.  Whatever.

Time to go home!

Love,  Kay

Hi! It's good to hear from you. This is just a quick note, that I'm not sure
you'll even get in time. But, I just got off the phone with Mother and she
asked me to ask you to call her when you get home, or she'll call you around
6:30.

Dad's sonogram is scheduled for next Tuesday at 3:45. I think that's what
she wants to tell you.

Well, Annie is outside pounding the tennis ball against the wall. I guess I
should go and give her a glove to pitch to. Oh, by the way. When she was
Michael's age we signed her up for t-ball. She spent the first practice in
tears. So, we pulled her off and waited before we started her. Now she loves
playing the game.

Enjoy the beautiful afternoon!

I love you!

Hi.

I'm working with Nancy Wodka on a deal with Virginia Power.  We are working 
on the PPA tomorrow.

Thanks for the offer of the tickets.  I'm sure Bob will enjoy the experience, 
even if the game is, well, an Astros game.  What a difference a year makes.

See you soon,

I haven't worked with any workout folks.  Do you know Lisa Mellencamp (in ENA 
Legal)?  She isn't in that area any more, but she used to be.  She might know 
the players.

Thanks very much Kay!

It certainly was a challenge.. it was great to have the moral support from 
you and others in Legal and Finance!

Now I need to determine what to do for an encore... know of any good 
(corporate finance) workout positions?

Best to you,

Hi there,

I'm thinking of working out after work - hopefully kind of early.  Ok with 
you?  I should still be home before 730.  

Michael took Bronco to school.  I'm sure he will have him at the CC.

Kay

Well, I told Michael that Bronco could ride in the wagon, so I guess he needs 
a wagon big enough for Bronco!

ckm

No problem. Have fun. Hopefully Michael and I will be working on his covered
wagon...why am I not surprised about Bronco...maybe we can figure a way to
work him into the wagon...NM

Thanks.  I'm in DC (actually, Richmond VA) with Nancy Wodka working on a

You may have addressed this in your email, but as I recall you were going to 
work on a summary of the restricted activities, as a foundation for the

You may have seen this...
We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

very interesting!

Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the 
best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The problem was, Ford's 
Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases, 
was even more expensive. For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further 
distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer. The result is a fine 
SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content. 
This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210 
horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies. Both engines come mated 
to a five-speed automatic transmission. The new V8 offers copious and refined 
power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers. 
Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing. 
Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its 
"New Edge" theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps. 
Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a 
distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone. 
Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however. An 
all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame 
design debuts this year. This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches - 
thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance 
to 9.2 inches. At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically 
improved. The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits 
flatter cornering characteristics. A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling 
even more, while increasing interior room. 
Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002 
Mountaineer. A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and 
a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment, 
although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does 
intrude through the floor. 
New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power 
adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front 
seats and heated exterior mirrors. Among the Mountaineer's new safety 
features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower 
front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles. Later in 
the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac 
traction/stability control system will also be available. 
The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine 
choices and improved rear suspension. There are plenty of SUVs on the market, 
but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the 
golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float 
your boat. 

Hi there,

Does anyone have a Finance/Accounting blessed professional services agreement?

Thanks,

Kay

I'm worrying again about summer.  Maybe we should check out the Y on Voss to 
see what they have, if anything.  What do you think?

ckm

I know I will be hearing from Gregg about this soon.  Any progress?

Thanks,

Kay

Here's the CA you requested.

Kay

Mr. Sorte,

Michael Brown and Janelle Schueur have requested that I forward this 
confidentiality agreement to your attention.

Regards, 

Kay Mann

My opinion is that there is that the letter agreement is not ready to be sent 
out, and won't be for a day or two.  It can't be sent out until the CA is 
returned to you signed.

   
	
	

Kay,

Chris Booth has been contacted by Northwestern Corp. regarding the purchase 
of our 7EA's.  Chris believes this is a very positive potential sale and 
there is no broker involved.  Attached is the CA for your review.  I used our 
form from your "Confidentiality Agreements" folder  (Chris would like to send 
the draft to Northwestern via e-mail this evening if possible).

Also attached is a copy of the Letter Agreement for the Purchase of 
Membership Interests that was prepared by Carolyn Campbell (per Chris Booth). 
Since the Northwestern Corp. transaction will be a turbo park deal (and you 
are the Queen of Turbo Park), Chris asked for your review and approval or 
comments.

Thanks

Hi Matt,

This is the document that I referenced in my voice mail.  It would be great 
if it could be compared against the  agreement for the Wilton Center.  I will 
call later to see if you've had any luck.  As you can guess, this is on a 
short fuse.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Herman,

Here's the agreement I referenced in my voice mail.  We will change it so 
that they can't buy any equipment without further written authorization from 
Enron.  Anything else?

Thanks,

Kay

Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Sorry, I lost track of the versions. Here are my two questions/comments:

What are we gaining or losing by putting a drop dead date of March 2004?

On 2.11, I think relinquishing them from "damage" is broader than it needs to 
be, since the contract language is "risk of loss".  However, if the deal is 
that they are off the hook for cosmetic deterioration during storage, I think 
that can be addressed specifically in the change order.

Kay

Kay:
We are sill awaiting your approval to proceed with this revision of CO 2 
(Storage of Unit 1) for Blue Dog.  Your last comment that I did not get GE to 
agree to was the change to their responsibility for cosmetic deterioration 
during storage.  They believe that any cosmetic deteriation in storage would 
be viewed as their fault, therefore there was no real distinction of fault.  
They want to be off the hook for normal deterioration that occurs during our 
storage in their storage facility.

PS.  Storage has begun.

like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last 
draft.   Guess you can say this is a sanity check!  If it looks good to you, 
then I will send it out, unless you prefer to make distribution.

Hi Fred and Suzanne,

I'm sending this to Suzanne so she can make these changes.  Suzanne, you'll 
find the document attached to an email I received from Fred on July 11, 
entitled Kendall New Development LLC.

Here's my comments on the ComEd agreement:

4.  Change 100,000 to 50,000 (right, Fred?)

5.  Add "and the purchase order or contract will be assigned to Customer (or 
Customer's designee) at Customer's request, including the warranty provisions 
of such purchase order or contract" after costs on the 7th line.

9.  Add "for the purpose of performing its Scope of Work" to the end of the 
sentence.

10.  Add "internal and external" before legal counsel on 5th line.

16.  Add "Customer may assign this Agreement to an affiliate without consent"

I'll be checking in.

Mr. Sorte,

Michael Brown and Janelle Schueur have requested that I forward this 
confidentiality agreement to your attention.

Good afternoon,

I'm attaching for your review a revised LOI.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Rusty, 

Since Carlos is working on the Pontiac and Plano sale, I'm going to forward 
this to him for his handling.  That way things will stay better organized.

Thanks,

Our current land option on the Pontiac site goes to June 11th, with a 6 month 
extension for $5000.  In order to enhance and maintain the value of the site 
(we're trying to sell it now) I have gotten Ben's authorization to secure an 
additional 12 month extension on the deal for $10,000.

I spoke to the landowner - Dick Greene - and he indicated that they would 
consider it, although he has never been in favor of an option structure 
since  he is 80 years old and just wants the money from the sale.  The 
concept I pitched today was that we would pay them for the 6 month extension, 
and give them an additional $5000 now in exchange for adding another 12 month 
extension on the back.  At the time we exercise that 12 month extension we 
would pay them another $5000.  He said he would have to hear what his lawyer 
said in this regard, but I think its close to a deal.  Perhaps we could 
arrange a conference call with Karen Way at Piper-Rudnick as she has dealt 
extensively with their lawyer Ed Legner.  Its good timing to hit him now, 
since he does a lot of tax work so he will want to wrap us up quickly.

As regards accounting issues, the total exercise price is 117 acres * $4500 / 
ac. = $526,500, and 5% = $26,325.  Total option premiums (including this 
extension I am proposing) will be $20,000.  I believe we may also need to 
amend the original option language to make it clear that the option fee is 
not part of the price.

Carloyn,

Is the promissory note structure still necessary, given the increase in the=

My notes indicate that the promissory note structure was used not due to HS=

concerns, but rather, in order to avoid issues associated with
disproportionate distributions resulting from the contribution of funds as
capital.  I believe that the use of an LLC as the subject entity eliminated
the HSR issues.  Of course, the higher HSR threshold is also now effective.=

Karen,

Fred Mitro forwarded an email you sent him concerning a legal question.  
Please be advised that Enron policy requires that all outside legal advice be 
coordinated through an inhouse lawyer, and certainly any legal advice given 
to Enron employees must be given to Enron counsel as well.  This requires 
some discipline on the part of our outside counsel, but we find it works in 
everyone's best interest.

Thank you for your attention to this very important policy.

Kay 

I have a PSA which needs to be made 97-10/TurboPark compliant.  Could you 
work on it?  I'll bring it around.

Thanks,

Kay

See the attached Contract Status matrix. All of the proposed agreements in 
the top half of the matrix also have been blessed, as have the Secondary 
Agreements..
	Barton Clark
	02/21/2001 08:48 PM
		 
FYI, attached are the forms of design and engineering contracts for the 
Ft.Pierce project. The Technical Design Services Agreement will be cloned - 
one for the Facility improvements and one for the King Plant improvements, 
and the Black & Veatch agreement relates to design of the transmission 
upgrades. The two Technical Design Services Agreements ( with Stone and 
Webster ) will be amended and restated to be full blown Turbo Park compliant 
EPC contracts ( covering procurement and construction, as well as design ) 
with Stone and Webster ( assuming its estimate and delivery date are 
acceptable), at the time the project goes into Turbo Park. 

The Black & Veatch agreement will not be bifurcated, as Black & Veatch will 
not be the EPC contractor, but we will expect the EPC contractor for the 
transmission improvements to warrant the work. One issue we have is how to 
get Black & Veatch to give a Turbo Park compliant transmission improvements 
design warranty, but we may be able to get the EPC contractor to warrant the 
design and the improvements ( Turbo Park did not raise this issue, but it may 
in the future, so we need to be thinking about that ). The Black & Veatch 
agreement also may be assigned to FPUA, along with the transmission upgrades 
EPC contract, as FPUA will own the transmission improvements and supervise 
their construction. 

The reason for bifurcating the agreements is to allow work on "soft cost" 
items to proceed now - as required to keep the project on schedule - until we 
can close the deal with FPUA/FMPA and get into Turbo Park, where the "hard 
cost" procurement and construction expenditures can be made without putting 
the project on balance sheet. 

I'll forward the form Turbo Park EPC Contract under separate cover. Sorry 
about the late deliveries, but maybe you will be able to pick these up in the 
am.
	Barton Clark
	02/08/2001 04:43 PM
		 
Attached are Turbo Park and accounting "approved" forms of the Technical 
Design Services Agreement between FPRP and Stone & Webster ( TDSA) and the 
Agreement for Professional Engineering Services between FPRP and Black & 
Veatch ( B&V Agreement). Each form has to now be fashioned to reflect the 
business deal/payment terms/etc. Note that the Scope of Work on the TDSA 
underwent substantial modification to conform with 97-10 requirements, and 
the attached draft Scope of Work only deals with the Facility ( as defined in 
the TDSA ), and not the "improvements" ( which term was included in the draft 
Tasking Letter from which the Scope of Work was fashioned).I assume we will 
need to "clone" this TDSA except for a different Scope of Work description to 
deal with such "improvements" other than the Facility ( ie, I assume these 
are the King Plant improvements).

The TDSA is calculated to put as much of the Turbo Park-approved EPC in front 
of Stone & Webster at the earliest possible date, so that the amendment and 
restatement of the TDSA to make it a full blown Turbo Park EPC Contract will 
be more straightforward. Right now, it is contemplated FPRP would assign its 
interests as Construction Manager under the TDSA to ENA, and the TDSA would 
be concurrently amended and restated as set forth above, both at the time the 
FPRP goes into Phase II of Turbo Park. At the time FPRP goes into Phase I of 
Turbo Park, I believe the TDSA can remain an FPRP obligation ( like any other 
development agreement signed by a project entity that is subsequently 
transferred into Turbo Park). Since the TDSA now only involves soft cost 
expenditures, FPRP can sign it as soon as it is negotiated and agreed by 
Stone & Webster and before it goes into Phase I of Turbo Park.

The B& V Agreement, which was modeled on Black & Veatch's agreement with 
FPUA, also can be signed prior to going into Phase I as soon as it is 
negotiated with Black & Veatch. Like the TDSA, there are commercial terms 
that need to be added. It was modeled on the FPUA Black & Veatch Agreement 
because that should speed negotiation with B & V on its terms, and we may 
want to assign the B & V Agreement to FPUA ( and they too would be 
comfortable with its terms). My understanding is that FPUA is supervising the 
transmission work and will be driving the design and engineering of the 
transmission facilities, so it may make sense for FPRP to assign the B & V 
Agreement to FPUA and simply retain the obligation to pay B & V ( up to a 
cap).

I also have attached a revised version of the spreadsheet Mathew prepared 
listing FPRP contracts already entered into by FPRP ( the so-called secondary 
development agreements)  and those proposed to be entered into before we go 
into Phase I of Turbo Park. Herman and Lisa, let me know which of  the 
secondary agreements you have not previously reviewed ( those marked NO re 
your review ) that you need to review, and I will endeavor to furnish them to 
you.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents 
and proceed.  I understand that you are in Houston.  Please call/see me

Kay:  We need to prepare a draft set of definitive agreements for this 
transaction.  Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York?  Also, 
what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units.  Let me 
know.

Kathleen:  We need to confirm tomorrow morning that we have received executed 
CA's from Panda.  I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda 
entities at my desk for Ben's signature.  These need to be received prior to 
sending Panda the definitive agreements.  We will fax signature pages to Ben 
tomorrow.

Chris:  See me tomorrow morning to discuss the technical spec's that were 
sent to Panda

I will be at my desk by 8 am tomorrow morning.

Thanks,

I'll get Kathleen to do it, as she has my current favorite form.  Thanks 
anyway.

The sale of the cash flow interest is a new deal that I am not working on and 
I think that the CA that Fred needs is to cover bidders for the purchase of 
the cash flow interest.  I will get Ed to prepare the CA if you wish. 

Please get with Fred to get something working.

The deal is for all four units at $16.45 million each. I will talk to Lee 
Johnson this morning. Part of the deal will involve us purchasing 4 
additional units from GE for a late '01 delivery.

I'll call you after I talk to Lee.

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

special purpose entities associated with the four(4) LV units.  I have left a

begin preparing a set of draft definitive agreements for their review.  I 
have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents 
and proceed.  I understand that you are in Houston.  Please call/see me 
tomorrow morning so that we can discuss this transaction.

what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units.  Let me 
know.

CA's from Panda.  I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda 
entities at my desk for Ben's signature.  These need to be received prior to 
sending Panda the definitive agreements.  We will fax signature pages to Ben 
tomorrow.

Hi Chauncey,

Are either of the restaurants very formal?  I want to make sure I bring the 
right clothes.

Thanks,

Here's a new deal for you.  

I've got two follow on deals for K & S, so this one might be a good one to 
use someone else, if you need and want to. (I hear the rustling of the 
pines..)  Clear outside counsel selections with Jeff, then Mark, etc.

Ben and I are working on a deal that involves the monetization of a Cash Flow 
Interest which ENA currently holds in Onondaga Cogeneration L.P. (an 80 MW 
combined cycle plant in NY state)

We would like to begin discussions next week with parties interested in 
purchasing ENA's interest in OCLP.  Please prepare a form CA and forward to 
Ben and I so that we may forward it to the interested counterparties.  We 
also need one draft CA prepared for the following counterparty:

 Trust Company of the West

Sheila has inititated the process of assigning the Cash Flow Interest from 
ENA into an LLC.

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Here are my car questions:

How much would a tricked out Sequoia cost if ordered from the manufacturer?

Is there a 2000 Escalade available with the cargo doors?

I'll get Kathleen to do it, as she has my current favorite form.  Thanks 
anyway.

Kay

The sale of the cash flow interest is a new deal that I am not working on and 
I think that the CA that Fred needs is to cover bidders for the purchase of 
the cash flow interest.  I will get Ed to prepare the CA if you wish. 

We had the legal call on Wednesday.  It was Mike, Kent and me. You didn't 
miss much.  They are waiting on us, and I didn't want to give them anything 
we hadn't discussed internally.

I asked Rose to have the Coyote Springs contract OBS'ed (off balance 
sheet-ed).  She should have something shortly. 

By the way, the contact sheet that Steve distributed was the one we prepared.

I'll catch you up on other stuff when you have time.  Nothing urgent...

Kay

If you are available I think it would be a good idea.  No big deal if you 
can't.

   If we are to have a conference call on March 9th to discuss the
Form Agreement, do you want me on this call?

Not a problem on the CAs at all.  I just noticed something in Sheila's 
email.  Sheila indicated she was NOT working the One-eyed Dog CFI assignment, 
but I 

really think she is working on it, because she just had me set up the entity 
to receive the CFI by assignment  (Onondaga Energy Venture, L.L.C.).   

Am I confused?  Just a little dazed, maybe?

That sounds great to me.  I love a good punt. When our team is kicking, well, 
it's a bonus.  I'll keep the ball rolling on the formation just to keep up

but after that I'll stay on hold until otherwise directed.  I'll send the

I set it as my new wallpaper.  The file was too big - SU wouldn't let it

I've just learned that this is a "West" deal for the sale of the LV Co Gen 
units.  

This deal was described as being the same as the Intergen deal.  King & 
Spalding helped me on that one, and when I thought this was an East deal I 
contacted Keffer for a conflicts check (there is none).  I haven't gone to 
Mark with it yet, though.

We have forms, etc for this, and I'm happy to provide whatever support I 
can.  Please advise as to how you would like to proceed.

Folks:

I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall deal 
to him ("Intergen" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a 
purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that 
the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be 
a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which 
means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is 
prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we 
proceed with as simple a transaction as possible.

I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the 
transaction as soon as possible.

Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up? I'm available all day 
today, and tomorrow to 3 PM EST.

As soon as I get the revised proposal from Lee, I will forward it to the 
group.

Regards,

Ben

Kay,

Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the 
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to 
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They 
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of 
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is 
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not 
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the 
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay 
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is 
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable 
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase 
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar 
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing 
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit 
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for 
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are 
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at 
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will 
let you know when I hear back from him.

Charlotte,

Great story!

Neil is at the Astrodome now. You might be able to reach him on his cell or 
by pager.  If I hear from him I will have him give you a call.

I'm in Florida, and looking out my window I saw an alligator swim by.  
Wouldn't Michael go crazy?

Bye,

Kay

   I forgot to tell you this.  When we were at Blockbuster last time,
Michael was trying to talk me into buying two videos.  I explained to him
that we were spending Mom and Dad's money and that we had to stay within
limits unless we had permission.  He decided on Dinosaur, but really, really
wanted another monster video.  He then started his jury argument with me
about how much I would enjoy watching that monster video at my apartment
when he was not there.  A couple standing near us was cracking up laughing
and said he is clearly going to be a lawyer when he grows up.

   Neil, I will probably take Michael to my apartment today so I can
have something on cooking while he is watching videos.  You can call and
confirm.  Since you are coming from the Astro Arena, won't it be just as
convenient for you?

Westinghouse has agreed that LJM doesn't need to sign it.  I sent SW a letter 
confirming that agreement.  Lynn tells me that they should sign it soon.  
Otherwise, the agreement is fully executed.

ckm

Kay,

What is the status of the Westinghouse settlement letter?  I thought that it 
had been fully executed but Mitch Robinson indicated that he thought that LJM 
still needed to sign.  In any case, Allegheny Energy's attorney has requested 
a copy of the letter that Westinghouse was obligated to send (regarding our 
ability to increase the maximum output at the Wheatland facility without 
affecting the warranties) pursuant to paragraph 3 of the letter.  Please 
advise ASAP.

Stuart

Lynn Dekrey is the guy Mitch negotiated the deal with.  Lynn left me a 
message on Monday and said he didn't see a problem, but he didn't give me a 
day we could expect the letter.  I would expect it this week.

Who is Lynn and when can we expect the follow up letter (i.e. the one that 
expressly permits an increase in output at the Wheatland Plant)?

Stuart

Gentlemen,

Does the Mississippi constitution impact the issue?  The munies are 
specifically citing Section  100 of the Mississippi constitution, and have

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

Sorry for the delay.  I ran into some complications.

Mom,

I don't remember if I told you I will be home for spring break. Danielle
wants us to go somewhere on our way home (she says Schlitterbahn, but I'm
thinking it'll be coooooold!). So I could be home as early as Friday.
Ashley has mentioned possibly going to her river house maybe on Thursday,
but no matter what, I'll be home for a good chunk of spring break. Just
thought I'd fill you in! Have a great rest of the trip.

Love,

Paige

I did write it for them, and sent it to Lynn.  We are waiting for them to 
sign it and send it back.

Kay

   

Sometimes the best way to get SW moving is to do the work for them.  We might 
want to draft a proposed letter to get the ball rolling.  I would suggest 
getting Allegheny to buy off on it.

message on Monday and said he didn't see a problem, but he didn't give me a 
day we could expect the letter.  I would expect it this week.

Who is Lynn and when can we expect the follow up letter (i.e. the one that 
expressly permits an increase in output at the Wheatland Plant)?

Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a 
bit for lessons learned.  I will forward the updated letter agreement which 
has been improved also.  It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the 
defined terms are different.  I will also forward the Intergen docs so you 
can see some of the definitions, etc.  

One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR 
issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is 
exercised.  

I also have the TurboPark docs, which I can forward when it gets closer.  I 
don't know if I have the electronic versions of the other closing docs.

Kay:

We did have a "form" LLC agreement in conjunction the letter agreement.  It
was most recently circulated in a Jan 4 e-mail from me and is the attached
draft dated Dec 15.  We may wish to tinker with the effective date
provisions of Section 2.5 and depending on whether XYZ is a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company, the entity representations in
Section 3.2.1 et seq. (I have also attached a marked copy reflecting the
differences between the prototype form and the final form signed in the
Intergen transaction).  If you need anything else, please let me know.
Thanks.

As I mentioned, I think the "new and improved" versions are better starting

Hi Lisa,

I received your voice mail regarding the ABB contract. As I recall, ABB 
signed the contract after I received approval from you (while we were on the 
phone on July 14 talking about the Moore project), Rose, and Herman, and had 
incorporated the comments sent by Rob Taylor. Quite frankly, I thought that 
was it for the GF approval process, so WestLB's comments came as a surprise 
to me when they were faxed in a few days later. 

I received a voice mail that indicated that ABB is ok with WestLB's changes. 
I expect Enron may be signing today, and we will need WestLB's signature. 
Please advise how this should be handled.

Kay 

Anyone know any good lawyers in Mississippi, or any lawyers knowledgeable 
about Mississippi law?  Power background would be nice, but I know that may 
be too much to ask.

Thanks,

Kay

Stuart,

If you need a copy of the executed Westinghouse letter, you can find the 
original on my desk, I believe on the left hand corner (looking out).  The 
letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that LJM doesn't need 
to sign.  I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders, but I 
requested it anyway.  

Kay

Yes.

Just let me know when you get bored...

Thank you for your helpful comments.  Good points.

On the timing issue, we still have the time sensitivity, but I hate to give 
it a precise day.  Maybe the way to address that is within 10 BD's, as 
mutually agreed.

I don't have the doc in front of me (I'm in Florida), but I thought it said 
ENA was taking responsibility for increases in the Purchase Amount as it 
exists the date of closing.  I'll check.

I agree with deleting CO definition.  It doesn't add anything.

Again, thanks.

Kay

Kay:

I have a few minor comments to the new draft of the LLC Letter Agreement:

1.  Section 2 - The new draft provides for closing "no later than 10
business days" after funding the escrow, while the old draft provided for
closing "on the 7th business day" after funding the escrow.  I have a
recollection that ENA actually needed the 7 business days and no less (thus
the requirement of ON the 7th business day) in order to prepare for closing,
and was trying to avoid the possibility of the counterparty wanting to close
before ENA could complete the matters required of it to properly effect a
transfer.  If the timing on this is not sensitive, the new draft is fine.

2.   Section 5(a) - The new draft provides that ENA is responsible for any
"increase in the Purchase Amount," if the increase is caused by ENA's acts
or omissions.  The new draft does not mention the base amount or point of
reference, any increase over which would thus be ENA's responsibility.  (The
old draft provided that ENA was responsible for the Purchase Amount, as
determined on the basis of facts and circumstances existing prior to
closing).

3.  Section 9(a)(xiv) - It appears that a verb is missing from this
sentence.

4.  Section 19(c) - I think the definition of "Commercial Operation" can be
deleted, since the only place it appears is in Section 19(g), where it is
used with the parenthetical (as defined in the Turbine Contract).  However,
we need to confirm that "commercial operation" is actually defined in the
Turbine Contract, as I believe this was the transaction where the term was
constantly used in the underlying agreement without definition.

5.  Section 19(g) - In the definition of "Take Over," replace both
references to "Unit" with references to the "GE Equipment".

Please call if you want to discuss these comments.  Thank you.

Greg,

I've read the opinion and agree with your summary of it.  However, it doesn't 
answer the question for me as to whether a Mississippi court would uphold 
such a clause, or how other contracting parties have dealt with the issue.  
Due to the importance of the issue I will consult with a Mississippi firm to 
get a handle on the question.

Thanks for your help,

Kay

As an update to my earlier e-mail, I located both the Miss. AG's Opinion
letter construing Section 100 and the initial request from a State entity
that prompted the Opinion.  

Assuming a State entity is a party to a contract, the AG's Opinion does not
opine that Section 100 prohibits contractual clauses that exclude
consequential damages.  Instead, the AG's office could not find any
statutory authority that allows a public officer to contractually limit a
private vendor's liability to the State entity.  Although the AG did not
state that such clauses are prohibited, the AG held that it could not
affirmatively sanction such clauses in the absence of statutory authority.

Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it, however, 
we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the extra wood 
package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we asked for a 
price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.  They offered 
to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.  When we priced 
these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package 
instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a 
third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these 
options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to "work on it".  The fellow 
you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay

Ben,

What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we 
were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this 
the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump 
through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check 
to see what the drill is on this side of the street.

Enron's standard 9 page engagement letter in lieu of the attached 2 pager

As discussed in Fort Pierce, Tripp Scott is that insurance policy I've been 
looking for to help secure the commission vote in Pompano.  Tripp Scott will 
also assist us in our door knock campaign in the County & Tallahassee.  
Pozzuoli is a mover & shaker and is on a first name basis with Jeb Bush -  he 
was the Chairman for the Bush/Cheny Broward County re-count.

Bill Keith & Debbie Orshefsky highly recommends the engagement.

Lets discuss Tuesday.

It was a pleasure meeting with you and Debbie on Monday afternoon.  Per our 
discussion, enclosed is Tripp Scott's proposed terms of engagement as well as 
an abbreviated description of the firm and its key directors.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Retention Letter amounts.  I have also included a blackline (first
document below) so that you can demonstrate to GE that no other changes
have been made.  To complete the Agreement, the date of execution must
be added to the first page and Exhibit H-2 must be inserted manually.  I
believe that you already have a copy of Exhibit H-2 provided by Lee

Hi Cindy,

Would it be possible to block some rooms for a couple of weeks while people 
make their reservations?  I'm thinking maybe ten rooms for May 4, 5, and 6, 
out on the 7th?  I would like it best if the individuals could call you 
directly to make the reservation.  How does that work for you?

Thanks,

Kay

CKM,

I spoke to Althea Gordon in the Recruiting Dept today regarding the poor 
treatment Paige received in the recruiting process.  Here is her response.

First of all, Paige should have received a rejection letter and a hold 
letter.  The rejection letter was from her submittal to the analyst process 
on her own.  The hold letter supposedly says that, based on referrals, she is 
on a waiting list and will be contacted for interviews provided there is any 
space left in the summer analyst class.  Basically they have offers out to 
what they call "first-tier" schools and are waiting for responses.  If they 
have any spots left, they will interview any candidates that are "on hold" 
based on resume review.

I asked why she didn't merit an interview right out of the gate and she told 
me it was because she was from a smaller school where we don't normally 
recruit and she lacked experience in Enron industries (sounded like a canned 
answer to me).

Will you check with Paige and see if she did get this "hold" letter?  I want 
to push to at least get her an interview, but am sensitive to making too big 
a deal about it and hurting her chances more than helping them.

I'll also talk to Charlene Jackson who runs the Analyst and Associate program 
and see if she has any advice.

Heather

Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
"work on it".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay

What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we 
were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this 
the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump 
through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check 
to see what the drill is on this side of the street.

When you got the other breakout contracts signed by Wilmington Trust, to whom 
did you send them?

I need to get the LV contract fully signed up now.

Please let me know.  

I'm sorry I missed seeing you last week.

Here are my responses:

1. Development fee is a commercial question.  This will need to be vetted 
with Herman if we go with it.  Personally, I'd skip it and push to sign next 
week.

2.  I have a call in to Dale.

3.  No LLC.  Kathleen will handle.  The closer the creation is to the signing 
of the letter, the better, taking into account the time required to get the 
docs back and set up.  Someone needs to name it.  We should also look at a 
minimal list of officers.

4.  I don't have the attachment in front of me, so I will have to look it 
up.  I'll get back to you.  The concept is that ENA is only responsible for 
changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date.  I thought the 
language was awkward, and tried to make it more clear, but obviously failed!  
As soon as I get the break out contract from Dale we can check on the 
definitional questions. It SHOULD be the same as in the CA breakout contract 
with GE, but I won't make that assumption.  Drop dead date on put/call Dec. 
2002.  

5. This needs to be discussed with Ben.    

6.  This should be set up as a  new matter, since these aren't the Blue Dog 
turbines. You can send the bill to Sheila with a copy to me.

I'll open the doc and take a look at it asap.

Kay

Kay, as I told you, Carolyn put out a set of intial draft documents and we 
debriefed Jake and Stephen.  Based on our meeting, Carolyn was going to make 
certain revisions based on the answers to the questions below and certain 
other items we raised during our meeting.  Nevertheless, your input is 
required on the following:

1.  We have discussed eliminating the payment of a development fee, which if 
Delta /  Panda were to breach its obligations prior to the funding of the 
Escrow would be non-refundable and serve as a form of liquidated damages.  
Commercially the inclination is to avoid that fee, we need to confirm that 
approach.

2.  We need to interface with Dale Rasmussen on the status of the break out 
contract and how quickly it can be incorporated into the form of Facility 
Agreement that would be part of our transaction.

3.  Have we established an LLC that will be sold for this project.

4.  Please see Caroline's questions 6, 7 and 13 below.

5.  Please see faxes that I left on your chair on the broker issue and 
whether we need to respond in writing.  Sheila Tweed's position was not to.

6.  John asked whether K&S should open a separate subfile or include the time 
charged within the Blue Dog file?

Thanks and we'll talk tomorrow.

Re;  enovate/Peoples
I called Jerry Fox to check on the status of the ICC Staff's testimony
which was to be filed Feb. 28. Jerry reports that Staff requested an
extension until March 29 to file their testimony. Staff has indicated that
it intends to conduct further discovery, i.e. send more data requests.
Jerry also says that Staff has inofrmed Peoples informally that it is
(apparently strongly) opposed to approval of the filing. Jerry says that
Peoples is considering whether to withdraw its Petition for approval. As I
understand it, this depends on whether there is a way to pursue
transactions with enovate without a need for approval (presumably under the
"market price" exception to the approval requirement.) I suggested that it
may be preferable to wait until Staff files its testimony (explianing its
position) before making a decision about withdrawal. Jerry says Peoples'
concern is the additional disocvery which may be conducted. As I understand
it, the case is being discussed internally at Peoples. I don't know whether
Peoples has discussed this with you (Gregg) or anyone at enovate.

You know so much!!!!!

This came back to me as undeliverable so I'll try again. NM

We need to verify this is a 36 mos lease because the term value says 48 mos.
I had said we wanted to see a rate at 36 mos with 10K down. I assume she
used the 10K as total out of pocket expenses at time of delivery and that's
why the cost reduction is 7500. The mo payment is about the same as the
Lexus. As for the two additions, the aftermarket folks do good work so that
should not be a concern. Shoot, some dealerships may even use the same folks
to do the work for them and then mark it up. Bottom line, it's your call. If
you choose to walk away, I'm ok with it. If you do, what do you want to do
going forward. Look at something else? Go back to McGinnis? NM

I would suggest the week of the 19th through the 23rd. Wednesday and Thursday

I have always enjoyed Americas, Churascos, or Cafe Annie for business

opportunities - they may be in the market for additional projects).

Have any steps been taken to plan this event?  I can call John Jones at

Intergen about other transaction opportunities. Any thoughts on whether we 
should invite the Coral folks?

 Please let me know your availability, and of any restaurant recommendations.

Thanks,

Ben

Obviously this is going complicate (and increase the cost) of the 
transaction.  Is there any way to push back on this?  We will now need four 
break out contracts, four sets of every other document, 4 sets of assigning 
docs out of TurboPark, etc....  Not hard to do, but a challenge to do on your 
time frame.

Catherine, John,

I just received this from Panda regarding their project company structure.  
Steve,
I was correct in my assumptions.  Each turbine should go into four different 
LP's.  Panda West Power I, L.P., Panda West Power II, L.P., Panda West 
PowerIII, L.P. and Panda West Power IV, L.P.  Please advise if you have any 
additional questions.
Regards,
Lori

Chris,

Please come see Carlos and I about the transaction.

Kay

   
	
	

Carlos,

I am working with NorthWestern in a negotiation similar to the Panda or Delta 
deal regarding the placement of a turbine.  NorthWestern has requested a 
draft of what the amended LLC document will look like, in particular, what 
rights and control will Enron have?  I would appreciate if you could send me 
a draft that I can forward to NorthWestern to further our negotiations.  We 
are working on an expedited schedule and would appreciate a quick response.  
Please advise when the document will be ready.

Thanks

Chris

Hi Pete,

Retention Letter amounts.  I have also included a blackline (first

have been made.  To complete the Agreement, the date of execution must
be added to the first page and Exhibit H-2 must be inserted manually.  I
believe that you already have a copy of Exhibit H-2 provided by Lee

Leatha,

I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in addition 
to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time frames are 
mentioned in your explanation.  

Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost include 
the tax trade on the Lexus?

Thanks for your help,

Kay

Kay,
The dealership will not come down on the price
for the gold and wood trim.  I have an aftermarket
company that can do both for $550.00.  Here is
a 36 month quote for the Cadillac including the
gold and wood.  Please review and let me know if you
have any questions.

EQUITY LEASE FOR TERM OF 36 MONTHS

$  39976.38   Cost of vehicle
    2498.52*Sales tax
     161.00*Registration

Leatha

Hi Leatha,

Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
"work on it".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
Lexus.

Thanks,

Kay

Carolyn,

I believe the commercial operations terminology is appropriate, not 
takeover.  Please verify with the LV CoGen documents which I forwarded just a 
few moments ago. The changes I made to the definitions in the prototype 
letter were a result of the fact that the Blue Dog contract with GE uses 
slightly different terminology than the LM 6000 contracts.  We need to revert 
to the appropriate underlying contract.

Thanks,

Kay

The last quote I sent over was for 36 months and
I haven't taken into consideration the price/tax
savings of the Lexus.  I contacted our remarketing
department and they are still working on getting
#'s.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More

Hi Carolyn,

In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other 
thoughts:

Letter agreement:

I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably 
haven't checked on availability.  

2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2 
(a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine 
Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.

3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 

5 (d)  change 1st "shall" to "'may".

7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific 
performance?

9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing 
of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been 
obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep 
unless you are comfortable.  I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't 
want to contradict it with the rep.

I'll review the LLC agreement next.

How long would we have until we need to release the rooms to avoid the

Hi Kay,

I'm so happy that you guys are coming to visit us.  May 4 - 7, 2001 are
great dates for your group to come, however I can not block rooms due to our
availability at this time.  .  The only way I can guarantee the rooms is to
get a $3000 pre-payment to hold the rooms.  If you would like to hold that
on your credit card until they call with their own, I can do that.  I  will
keep an eye on it for you and if you just want to have everyone call me as
soon as they can or I can call them.

Just let me know how I can make this easiest for you.  Do you know if your
group wants signature or premier rooms?

See you soon.

Ben,

What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we 
were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this 
the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump 
through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check 
to see what the drill is on this side of the street.

As discussed, Roger has no problem engaging Tripp Scott.  He does want to use 
Enron's standard 9 page engagement letter in lieu of the attached 2 pager 
received from Tripp Scott.  Is this necessary - any thoughts?

As discussed in Fort Pierce, Tripp Scott is that insurance policy I've been 
looking for to help secure the commission vote in Pompano.  Tripp Scott will 
also assist us in our door knock campaign in the County & Tallahassee.  
Pozzuoli is a mover & shaker and is on a first name basis with Jeb Bush -  he 
was the Chairman for the Bush/Cheny Broward County re-count.

Bill Keith & Debbie Orshefsky highly recommends the engagement.

Lets discuss Tuesday.

Steve
It was a pleasure meeting with you and Debbie on Monday afternoon.  Per our 
discussion, enclosed is Tripp Scott's proposed terms of engagement as well as 
an abbreviated description of the firm and its key directors.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Before you send out the next draft we need to talk briefly.

Please put on my schedule.
I think we should do a phone conference to resolve the outstanding issues 
regarding the engagement of "local lobbying firms" by ENA.  I will schedule a 
call for tomorrow at 10:30am (cst).  Please advise if that time works with 
your schedule.  Thanks.

Thanks.  I think we have alot of the same accounting issues here if the PPA 
is construed to be a lease.  If it is a lease, we have similar spending and 
EPC concerns as our other deals.  Do we know who the O&M contractor will be?  
If ENA or affiliate, we should not take on plant risk - just make sure our 
fair value O&M fee is the only amount at risk under the O&M agreement.  As of 
Friday, AA told us that even in a non-offtake situation, they may say we are 
in a lease if we take on plant risk through an O&M agreement.  This was new 
news to us.

I'm working with the commerial team on on PPA (and associated transactions) 
for Virginia Power.  The project involves the construction of  a peaker to 
supply some/most of the power, with the ability to supply from the market as 
well.  The plant has an 01 service date, so things are really picking up. 

Matt and Herman, this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few 
weeks ago.

Items on the immediate to do list include:

Executing a land option agreement
Closing on the land (or assign to City of Rocky Mount, and let them close)
Selling/transferring the land to the City of Rocky Mount; negotiate long term 
lease
Negotiating a PILOT agreement (payment in lieu of taxes) with the City
Negotiating fuel supply agreements
Selecting/contracting with EPC contractor - can it be NEPCO?
Long lead equipment purchases (?) - could be home for LM 6000's, but other 
equipment may be needed
Negotiate interconnection agreement

This deal is showing a lot of life, so I thought it might be helpful to give 
you a heads up.

Kay

Dale,

Has GE initialled all the pages of the break out contract?  If so, it would 
be very helpful if you could ship me the originals.  That way, we only have 
to change the names, which will make it easier for Lee when we have to ask 
him to sign.  Also, has someone from the Enron side initialled all the 
pages?  That helps, too!

Kay

I don't know who started the initialling kick, and I don't know if I care if 
it continues.  I don't know if Lee cares.  It is probably an EECC artifact.  
If GE doesn't care, then I don't care.  ( I hear strains of a show tune "I 
don't care, I don't care").

I think I've lost my mind.

This is step 2 in an ongoing mystery.

When I got the files from Peter there were no initial lines for the 
contract.  I was surprised, but presumed that this was no longer a 
requirement.

Bill Williams has said he is prepared to initial whatever we put in front of 
him.  If we do the new form, we would have to redo the pages anyway (I 
presume).  If we take that course and I get the electronic version up here, I 
will ask Bill to sign on.

Engage, Mr. Data.

Please use NewCo instead of Spawn.  Also, please give them only one business

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

No big deal.  I'm just trying to tie up loose ends when I can.  I suspect 
they must have gotten paid, or else someone would be complaining.

I made a couple of minor revisions.  Jake has given us until when he gets in 
tomorrow.

I changed Turbine Agreement to Turbine Contract (one place in the LOI), and 
added responsibility for filing fees in the llc agreement.  Perhaps it it 
redundant.

I'm not sure I'm on top of the LLC agreement.  Maybe we can discuss in the 
am.

Sorry to hear about Bobby's wreck.  I hope he feels ok tomorrow.  Neil's 
number at work is 713 596 8716, and  his email is nmann@erac.com.  I know you 
probably checked this, but are you sure you don't have car rental insurance 
under your auto policy?  Always good to check.

Paige got a kick out of seeing Bobby.  I'm sure he enjoyed the fine cuisine.

I feel the same about going up next week.  There will probably be a more 
appropriate time later.

Paige is coming home for SB next week.  I suspect she'll come Friday or 
Saturday, but don't know for sure.  We are probably going to the Matagorda 
livestock show and auction this weekend, and maybe the rodeo.  It must be 
good - like the Belton rodeo.

Hi and hugs to all!

Love,

Kay

Carlos,

I am working with NorthWestern in a negotiation similar to the Panda or Delta 
deal regarding the placement of a turbine.  NorthWestern has requested a 
draft of what the amended LLC document will look like, in particular, what 
rights and control will Enron have?  I would appreciate if you could send me

Hi there,

I think a good next step while the counterparties are reviewing the docs is 
the creation of a closing checklist, since we have a good starting point with 
the Intergen closing list.  We can get organized on putting together a 
package of the next traunche of docs, such as the parent guaranty, escrow 
agreement, etc. 

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  You might want to check the docs I sent out to Jake to make sure I 
didn't put a Panda in a Delta doc.  I checked, but I need to be double 
checked.  Another good reason to use XYZ's until the finalist is selected.

	
	

Lisa,

Sorry, I should have included you in the initial distribution.

Ben Jacoby and I are in negotiations with NorthWestern Corporation in a deal 
to place the two GE 7EA's (Blue Dog) turbines.  NorthWestern has indicated a 
strong interest in adding the dual fuel option to the February 2002 delivered 
turbine.  We hope to have NorthWestern sign the LOI by next Friday, 16 
(3/16/01) and pay the "Development Fee".  This transaction should be similar 
to the Intergen deal, with the exception that instead of moving two turbines 
out of the 24 LM 6000 master contract, we plan on assigning the entire Blue 
Dog contract to a LLC that Enron will own 100% at the time of transfer and 
then sell 80% to NorthWestern.

I want to have the change order ready for execution once we come to terms 
with NorthWestern.  In the event that the deal blows up, we will probably 
execute the change anyway.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
concerns.

Maybe this will help identify those who are REALLY in.  There may be a couple 
of new ones also. 

Thanks,

Hi Kay,

If we hold the rooms with the prepayment I would need a cancellation before
March 23rd in order to fully refund the pre-payment amount.  Let me know
what you think, I work with you however I can.

Looks good to me.  Is it ready for me to print and give to Ben?

Kathy, how many originals do you think we should have signed? 4 or 5? Or some 
other number?

Kay

Kay/Scott:

Here is the latest version:

Kathy

I've made a couple of changes, including changes suggested by Jeff 
Blumenthal.  Main difference is title/risk of loss language and definition of 
"the Agreement" since we don't have an MOU.

Kay

I'm not sure why this came to me, but I thought I would share it anyway.
Pursuant to the request of Fred Aldin, attached are marked copies of
both the GenPower ADA and the Mitsubishi ADA showing the changes to
Sections 7.2(f) and 8.4.

Kay --

I'm sending you some forms to work from on Enron's standard Government 
Affairs Consulting Services agreement (Marcia Linton will deliver).  Included 
within this form is language that can be added to discuss the success fee.  
As we discussed on the phone, my understanding is that the success fee is 
legal for non-state level activities in Florida.

I am happy to sign these arrangements to move the process forward.  We need 
to make sure the arrangements indicate the correct primary point of contact 
(Project Manager) and the right billing person.

Thanks,

Jim

Thanks so much for your help.

Our counsel has provided these drafts of the project documents.  Please 
review.  We also anticipate sending out the turbine contracts later today.

Please be advised of our timeline.  Since we need to fund escrow by Wednesday 
21 March, it is imperative that we are able to sign these documents on Friday 
16 March.  It is our assumption there will be some lag between the obligation 
to fund escrow and the actual transfer of funds.  

Your comments to these documents are expected by Friday 9 March.

I also want to mention that Enron initiated the additional purchase of Power 
System Stabilizers, which cost $31,675 per turbine.  PSS are required in the 
WSCC, but you will have to  determine whether or not your particular project 
would be required to install these in New England.  If you desire this 
optional equipment, please reflect that cost in your final bid.

Will you be making a pledge?  NM

My brother is riding in the MS 150 on April 21st for a friend of our family
with MS.  Would any of you be interested in giving Charles a pledge?  He
and the MS Society would appreciate any donations -- none are too small.
Thanks in advance.  Suzanne

funny, she didn't ask me!  $25 never hurts.

Atta girl.

You should have heard Ben complementing you to Jeff.  Ben said he wished you 
worked for him so that he could participate more in your PRC review.  The  
point was not lost on me!

Neither have us have spoken to GE.  I think Sheila spoke to Lee, but I don't 
know the substance of the conversation.  We asked his permission  on the 
Intergen deal, I believe.  I told Jake last night that there are arguments 
which can be made on both sides as to whether GE needed too consent to having 
the contract distributed to a potential partner.  He said he wanted to talk 
to you about it.

My suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the 
general status, and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract.  That is 
the most conservative approach.

Carlos:  Jake is hoping to get a copy of the turbine contract out to Delta 
this afternoon.  

Do you know whether anyone has approached GE for consent to disclose the 
contracts to potential purchasers?

It sounded yesterday as though the form of contract may be changing, anyway.  
Either way, GE's consent is probably required.  Do you agree?

Would you or Kay mind coordinating with Jake how and when the document can go 
out?

Please forward the attached documents below and not the prior ones in the

Time for a battle field promotion.  I'll be Tanto, you can be him that sabes.

Well, that's one reason why I don't think there's a lot of risk to it.  I 
know in previous deals the GE frame guys have agreed that we could give three 
redacted copies to suitors, and the real one to THE ONE.  I think a casual 
conversation will work.  The guarantees are nothing special, although the LD 
ramp rates sometimes matter.  Lastly is delivery, but again, I don't think it 
will be a big issue.

Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors 
are, that might help.

Thanks for the update.  I suggested to Jake that he do that (but perhaps too 
obliquely) yesterday.  I will ask directly that he make it so.

What is your sense as to the things that need to be redacted?  The breakout 
contract is structured in terms of what remains to be paid (rather than what 
the overall purchase price was).  I had understood that this was the subject 
matter that GE is most sensitive to.

Thanks for the prompt and diligent effort---good work!  I will forward this

Scott, for your review and comment, attached is a revised version of the 
Trinity Consulting Agreement that I have modified so that it more closely 
resembles our standard form of consulting agreement.  Also, please note that 
our accounting group has also blessed this agreement.

As a summary, the substantive changes that I made are as follows:

- Article 1 now more specifically describes the standards by which Trinity 
will perform its services (these changes should be a non-issue)

- Article 3 now imposes certain conflict of interest obligations on Trinity.  
3.1 obligates them to represent and warrant that their entry into an 
agreement with us will not breach any other obligations that would otherwise 
have to other parties.  3.3 imposes the obligation on them to obtain our 
prior consent before they perform any work for any third party or government 
agency that would have "an adverse effect" on us (this is direct change from 
their form which had no such obligation but which is standard in our 
consulting agreements and is a reasonable request.) 

- Article 4 adds our standard language that Contractor is an independent 
contractor and not entitled to any of our employment benefits.

- Article 5, inserted a 2 year term.

- Article 6 inserted that payments are within 30 days and that reimbursements 
must be in advance.  Please note that since I cannot edit the Price Schedule, 
then conforming changes to it need to be made, including whether to strike 
the 18% interest charge for late payments and whether to accept the 15% 
out-of-pocket surcharge (neither of which is in our standard agreement).  I 
also inserted your name for invoices.

- Article 7 added a termination event that the breach of the conflict of 
interest or confidentiality obligations is an immediate event of termination.

- Article 8, inserted your name for notices with a copy to me in the legal 
department.

- Article 9, I revised the liability limitation to make it reciprocal and 
excluded from the liability limitation, damages that would arise from 
Trinity's breaches of Section 3.1 (that entering into this agreement will not 
breach any other agreements that they have), Article 10 (indemnification for 
personal injury or death claims attributable to them), Section 12.2 (not 
providing us with information that violates someone else's intellectual 
property rights) and Section 13 (non-disclosure / confidentiality 
obligations).  Note that although accepting a liability limitation is not 
standard per our agreements, by making the foregoing exceptions, the 
liability limitation that we are effectively agreeing to is only with respect 
to any "malpractice" claims that we would have against them if their work was 
not up to industry standards.

- Article 10, this is an indemnification provision which obligates them to 
indemnify us for personal injury or death claims attributable to them.

- Article 11, states that the ownership of work product developed will be 
ours and that they will not provide us with any information etc. that they do 
not have the intellectual property rights ownership of.

- Section 13.4 are certain procedures to be observed in the event that a 
court requires the production of confidential information (the text is 
standard boilerplate.)

- Article 14 states that they have all liceneses to perform the work and to 
the extent that any are needed they will obtain them at their own cost and 
expense.

- Article 15 is our standard boilerplate.

- Formerly Article 12 on Non-Solicitation of Employees - per our discussion 
this has been struck

- Section 17.1 now imposes venue in Harris County, Texas not Dallas County.

- Section 17.2 allows us to assign the agreement to any of our affiliates 
without their consent but subject to notifying them of the assignment

- Section 17.8 requires our consent before they use Enron's name in any 
advertising

- Exhibit A terms and conditions have all been struck since those duplicated 
what was in the Master Agreement.

Please call me with any questions that you may have or let me know how I can 
be of further assistance.

Thanks.  I think we have alot of the same accounting issues here if the PPA 
is construed to be a lease.  If it is a lease, we have similar spending and 
EPC concerns as our other deals.  Do we know who the O&M contractor will be?  
If ENA or affiliate, we should not take on plant risk - just make sure our 
fair value O&M fee is the only amount at risk under the O&M agreement.  As of 
Friday, AA told us that even in a non-offtake situation, they may say we are 
in a lease if we take on plant risk through an O&M agreement.  This was new 
news to us.

I'm working with the commerial team on on PPA (and associated transactions) 
for Virginia Power.  The project involves the construction of  a peaker to 
supply some/most of the power, with the ability to supply from the market as 
well.  The plant has an 01 service date, so things are really picking up. 

Matt and Herman, this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few 
weeks ago.

Items on the immediate to do list include:

Executing a land option agreement
Closing on the land (or assign to City of Rocky Mount, and let them close)
Selling/transferring the land to the City of Rocky Mount; negotiate long term 
lease
Negotiating a PILOT agreement (payment in lieu of taxes) with the City
Negotiating fuel supply agreements
Selecting/contracting with EPC contractor - can it be NEPCO?
Long lead equipment purchases (?) - could be home for LM 6000's, but other 
equipment may be needed
Negotiate interconnection agreement

This deal is showing a lot of life, so I thought it might be helpful to give 
you a heads up.

To tell you the truth, this stuff is difficult for me to retain, so I could 
be completely off base. I would like to have Herman walk through it again.

It makes one wonder whether one can be in any position in these deals and not 
be in a lease.  Maybe we should ask Herman to describe one.  I was under the 
assumption that if the PPA is not plant specific, there is less of a concern 
on who the EPC contractor is.  I also thought the O&M affiliate was fatal 
even if we sold down the equity.  Have I missed the question again?

He doesn't know that Sheila undermined his authority with his client, and 
intervened.  Remember her saying she wasing going to stay out of it?

Just shoot me if I do that to you.  Or at least kick me.

Kay

It has now clicked that  you were looking for a letter in addition to the 
settlement letter.  That didn't sink in before.

fyi
Chris,
You have probably done this already but please insure that 
accounting/transaction support (Herman Manis or Cris Sherman) have reviewed 
the proposed sale structure to insure the appropriate accounting treatment 
for this transaction.

Also, I will need to review and approve all the agreements with NorthWestern 
before they are finally agreed to between the parties and executed.  As for 
the purchase of the assets out of the financing facility, Kay knows the 
required documents from the Intergen deal.  There needs to be close 
coordination amongst all the internal groups to insure your deal closes 
timely and accurately.  Remember in your negotiations that the money from 
NorthWestern needs to be received into escrow a minimum of 5 Business Days 
before the closing date.  The financing requires the purchase notice (which 
is irrevocable so if Enron provides it and NorthWestern walks, the turbines 
are on Enron's balance sheet at 15% interest rate essentially) be provided to 
the banks at least 5 but not more than 15 Business Days prior to closing date 
for purchase from the financing vehicle.

Thanks for the heads up.

Lisa,

Sorry, I should have included you in the initial distribution.

Ben Jacoby and I are in negotiations with NorthWestern Corporation in a deal 
to place the two GE 7EA's (Blue Dog) turbines.  NorthWestern has indicated a 
strong interest in adding the dual fuel option to the February 2002 delivered 
turbine.  We hope to have NorthWestern sign the LOI by next Friday, 16 
(3/16/01) and pay the "Development Fee".  This transaction should be similar 
to the Intergen deal, with the exception that instead of moving two turbines 
out of the 24 LM 6000 master contract, we plan on assigning the entire Blue 
Dog contract to a LLC that Enron will own 100% at the time of transfer and 
then sell 80% to NorthWestern.

I want to have the change order ready for execution once we come to terms 
with NorthWestern.  In the event that the deal blows up, we will probably 
execute the change anyway.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
concerns.

Chris,  Global Finance (Lisa Bills) needs to be kept in the loop on this, 
since this is in TurboPark.

Renee and Brian,

Please prepare a change order to add dual fuel to the February '02 delivery 
turbine.  The price and commercial information is below.  I have gotten Jeff 
Darst to extend the deadline to exercise the change order to 16 March 2001.

Please make sure we get the change order prepared before the deadline expires.

Happy New Year!

Here is the Citibank Schedule of Fees updated with the "Waived for initial
setup" and the "F." in Ben's name.

Do you have the wiring instructions yet so I can put them in the escrow
documents and circulate those docs as final??

Thanks,

I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, 
with a simultaneous sale of  80% of the equity to a third party.  This deal 
is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark 
and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.  I thought I would 
share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy.

Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to 
take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is 
required.

There will be other documents involved as well:

Bill of Sale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment)

I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to 
come on this one.

As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised.

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.

Thanks,

Kay

moving into the space just outside of John Rigby's office presently
occupied by boxes. The Carlos Sole Memorial Office presently occupied by

New item added to incorporate resignations of Enron appointees on closing

And a tough crowd it is.  I'm up for it. He seems genuinely happy for you.

You are destined for political greatness.

Please print the clean version below.  My computer won't let  me print - I 
tried two different printers.
Kay:

Attached please find an initial draft of the First Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement for Project Blue Dog.  I am also
including a marked copy of the same that illustrates all of the
modifications that I made to the Delta form that you e-mailed to me
yesterday.

Two questions came to mind as I was preparing the draft.  First, if, as
stated in Section 2(b) of the Letter Agreement, the Turbine Contract is
between LLC and GE, why does the ENA have to cause the LLC to acquire such
rights?  No immediate answer jumped out at me upon reviewing the Turbine
Contract.  Second, I wasn't sure if the year in Sections 6.2(a) and (c)
needed to be 2001 or 2002.  Please let me know.

Regards,

Marisa

This means that we all need to work together to make this happen. I would

This list should include site plans and other drawings that we've spent a lot

I look forward to reviewing this list.

Don't forget that Herman reads everything, and to ask Fred if this deal will 
be DASH'ed.  (I don't know if it should, but probably so.)

I would want to make sure that the structure of the deal goes through 
Herman.  There may be a tweak or a change which can have an impact on what 
gets booked on mark to market basis, etc.  He may have absolutely nothing to 
add, but I wouldn't take the chance.

Will do.  Should I forward the assignment agreement to Herman (it's just a 
boilerplate assignment and assumption agreement between two affiliates?)  Of 
course, after I talk with Fred, it makes sense to speak with Herman and Matt, 
but it doesn't seem to make sense before then.  Let me know if you think 
otherwise.

PS.  Hope it isn't too inconvenient for you to come.  Sheila really wanted 
you there.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This afternoon you will receive a Logon ID and Password to a secure website 
known as LegalNetEx ("LNX").   LNX will provide the Enron/GE Turbine Contract 

Team with a centralized location for the efficient and organized exchange of 
contract drafts and revision proposals.  It works like this:

1.  When you log on to LNX, a set of instructions will lead you to the most 
recent version of the contract.   To review and revise the contract you will 

download the document onto your PC or LAN.     

2. Consistent with normal drafting, you will need to save your revised 
version of the contract on your system, under a new name.  

3. When you are ready to provide your revised version of the contract to the 
rest of the team, you will upload the your document onto LNX.  Peter Thompson 
will 
receive an automatic email from LNX each time a team member uploads a revised 
document.  

4.  When Peter  has incorporated the various revisions proposed by the team, 
he will upload the resulting revision cycle on LNX.    Each team member will 

receive an automatic email notification when Peter uploads the latest and 
greatest version of the contract. 
   

Additionally, you will not have to redline your document for the group, LNX 
will handle redlining for us, it's automatic, too.

If you have questions or difficulties with LNX, please contact Matt 
Troncelliti of LegalNetEx using either matt@internetex.com or 610/617-1753.

For nontechnical questions or comments, please feel free to contact me, Ed 
Hearn, using either ed.b.hearn.iii@enron.com or 713/853-1592.

Thank you,

Attached is a clean and red lined version of the loi.  I'm expecting a call 
from David Hunt,  so I haven't dealt with the limit of liability stuff yet.  
The Beck comments are good comments which we need to discuss internally, but 
since we haven't, I'm happy to take the position that the comments seem to 
fit better in the drafting of the definitive ageements.

Kay

Gentlemen,

Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land option 
agreement.  The most significant change is that it is clear that the option 
payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the purchase 
price.  There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re assignment) that the 
assignee remains responsible for any liability arising prior to assignment.  

I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.  Please 
advise if this version is acceptable.  Also, please let me know if you would 
like for me to have a redline version prepared.

Kay

Hi Marisa,

Please send the forms to Carlos also since for 2, 3, and 4 we will use the 
same forms. Obviously, we want the economy of doing this once for both 
transactions.  Also, please bill the time for these forms to Carlos' deal, 
since Blue Dog is paying for some of the development of the letter agreement 
and the llc forms.

It sure sounds like we won't be tendering a facility agreement, but until the 
structure is agreed I would keep the letters in as place holders.

Once the LLC is formed you will get the complete corporate books which will 
have the certificates.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

Later this afternoon, I plan to send you preliminary drafts of the following
documents:

1. Revised Letter Agreement;
2. Escrow Agreement;
3. Guaranty Agreement; and
4. Promissory Note by LLC payable to ENA.

In the meantime, I had a couple of questions. First, since the Blue Dog deal
is a wholesale assignment of a contract, will I still need to prepare items
7 and 8 on the closing checklist (letter from ENA to Prospective Buyer to
deliver the form of Facility Agreement and letter from Buyer to ENA to
advise regarding the Form of Facility Agreement).  Second, will you send me
the blank certificates that will serve as the Membership Certificates for
the LLC?  Carolyn mentioned that, in the past, these certificates have come
from an Enron Stock Book.

Thanks,

Marisa

Hi John,

Additionally, we are drafting against ourselves.  The letter agreement and

My contact is Ms. Sammy Marroquin.   Borrower is cynthia kay mann.

We have an agreement which resides in TurboPark.  Kathy Clark did the 
contract.

Kay:  Brice Golden insists that he has learned about the existance of a 
Purchase Agreement in place under which projects such as his for Ft Pierce 
can add their order for Transformers, without having to negotiate a stand 
alone contract.  Sort of an ala carte arrangement.  I have asked Sheila Tweed 
what she knew about this, and she said she had nothing, but did not know what 
you might have done.  I know we have done bulk purchases and later split for 
the different peaker  projects, and some others similar to that, but no 
blanket agreement.  What have you got?

This was the emergency.

The outside lawyer for Northwestern, Marguerite Kahn, would like to speak 
with you concerning the structure of the LLC, specifically including the 
promissory notes.  Guess I didn't explain it all that well. I asked her just 
to call you directly, and gave her your number.

Thanks,

Kay

Turbine Team,

For future reference we should add in the put/call language (similiar to the 
language in 6.2 (c) of the Intergen deal) which allows Enron to put the 
equity to the buyer at any time GE consents.  We should soften the approval 
rights of the purchaser.

Thanks,

Kay

Please don't.  I enjoy the laughter!  I was just jealous.

Sorry.  I'll try to keep myself and my clients under better control on a 
going forward basis.

Stuart

Ann Elizabeth,

Can you handle this?  This is another Florida lobby deal.

I'm working with the commerial team on on PPA (and associated transactions) 
for Virginia Power.  The project involves the construction of  a peaker to 
supply some/most of the power, with the ability to supply from the market as 
well.  The plant has an 01 service date, so things are really picking up. 

Matt and Herman, this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few 
weeks ago.

Items on the immediate to do list include:

Executing a land option agreement
Closing on the land (or assign to City of Rocky Mount, and let them close)
Selling/transferring the land to the City of Rocky Mount; negotiate long term 
lease
Negotiating a PILOT agreement (payment in lieu of taxes) with the City
Negotiating fuel supply agreements
Selecting/contracting with EPC contractor - can it be NEPCO?
Long lead equipment purchases (?) - could be home for LM 6000's, but other 
equipment may be needed
Negotiate interconnection agreement

This deal is showing a lot of life, so I thought it might be helpful to give 
you a heads up.

Kay

Jake mentioned Delta but not Panda.  I'm with you - go Delta.  Who wants to 
mess with the broker issue?

Ciao,

Kay

Steve Thome just called with an update:

- Panda will be providing comments next week 

- Sunlaw dropped out because California rescinded its fast track permit 
approval process and thus Sunlaw will not have permits for the facilities it 
wants

- Delta will provide comments on Monday

Have a good weekend.  Go Delta they're the remaining high bidder.

I am selling my Bayou II kayak by Dagger.  It is a two person, enclosed 
style, kayak perfect for enjoyable kayaking with a special friend or family 
member.  Especially good for fishing because one person can paddle and 
position the boat while the other fishes.

Hi.  I'm interested in joining.  What do I need to do to join?

Please check the cancellation policy for next week's seminar.  I may not be

Hi Ed,

I can't find (or recall) that I received the subsequent email referenced in

Administrator and Legal Net X, and all my emails from 3/8. 

Thanks,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This afternoon you will receive a Logon ID and Password to a secure website 
known as LegalNetEx ("LNX").   LNX will provide the Enron/GE Turbine Contract 

Team with a centralized location for the efficient and organized exchange of 
contract drafts and revision proposals.  It works like this:

1.  When you log on to LNX, a set of instructions will lead you to the most 
recent version of the contract.   To review and revise the contract you will 

download the document onto your PC or LAN.     

2. Consistent with normal drafting, you will need to save your revised 
version of the contract on your system, under a new name.  

3. When you are ready to provide your revised version of the contract to the 
rest of the team, you will upload the your document onto LNX.  Peter Thompson 
will 
receive an automatic email from LNX each time a team member uploads a revised 
document.  

4.  When Peter  has incorporated the various revisions proposed by the team, 
he will upload the resulting revision cycle on LNX.    Each team member will 

receive an automatic email notification when Peter uploads the latest and 
greatest version of the contract. 
   

Additionally, you will not have to redline your document for the group, LNX 
will handle redlining for us, it's automatic, too.

If you have questions or difficulties with LNX, please contact Matt 
Troncelliti of LegalNetEx using either matt@internetex.com or 610/617-1753.

For nontechnical questions or comments, please feel free to contact me, Ed 
Hearn, using either ed.b.hearn.iii@enron.com or 713/853-1592.

Thank you,
Ed

Did LegalNetEx send your ID and Password?

Hey guys,

PSA's are a hot topic, and I have a call into Lisa Bills to discuss it.  Lisa 
has been out of town for a few days, as has the GF TurboPark lawyer, Rose 
Engeldorf.  Rose is being seconded to ENA for TurboPark issues, and will be 
back in the office tomorrow.  We should sit down with Rose and puzzle through 
the issue.  

As for the "standard" EECC form PSA, it is a real bear.  Carlos has recently 
worked on a TurboPark/97-10 compliant form, and is waiting for Global Finance 
blessing.  He was going to talk to Bart about his experience, which could 
also add some extra insight.

When you guys have some time it is probably worth taking a half hour to 
discuss it.  

Kay

Right, Renee. We don't want to do sonething that might inadvertently bust any 
eventual off-balance sheet treatment that might apply. 

Hey, Ann. FYI, our usual form of PSA and Tasking Letter didn't fit these off 
balance structures on Mr. Clark's Ft. Pierce job. There was something of a 
controversy as a result and they had to be re-worked. We don't want to go 
there again.

Kay, Ann, and Steve, do you know if  this project is to be Turbo-Parked and 
if so is the work  that you need the PSA and TL hard cost or soft cost? If 
it's to be Turbo Parked, let's work from the  forms Bart developed for Ft. 
Pierce. Renee, please copy Ann on each draft you turn out, including before 
you launch to the other side. 

I am out of the office this week,but checking e-mail and voice mail about 
once a day.  Please leat a voice mail for me at 713-646-6309 if you need me.

Thanks.

John,

I have received the following request for a PSA and Tasking Letter between 
ENA and EDSA from Steve Rose.  I want to make sure that the Deerfield 
Project, part of the Florida Greenfield Projects, is not being done through 
Off-Balance Sheet Financing, as this would preclude us from using the PSA 
form of contract.  To this end, I am copying Ann Elizabeth White, the ENA 
attorney on the Florida Greenfield Projects.

Once it is determined whether a PSA and Tasking Letter is acceptable for the 
work, I will proceed accordingly.  

If the Florida Greenfields are being financed through Turbo Park, I believe 
Bart Clark has a Turbo Park form for the landscape artitecture firm being 
used on the Ft. Pierce Project and I could try getting a copy of that from 
him.

Thanks

Renee,

I let you a voice mail message about this on Friday.  We have up until now 
been using the landscape architecture firm of Curtis-Rogers, working under a 
subcontract with Parsons Brinckerhoff, on the Deerfield Beach and South Dade 
sites.  Steve Krimsky has decided that he wants to use EDSA (another 
landscape architecture firm we've used on Pompano Beach) to complete the 
landscaping design work on Deerfield Beach, and to have them work directly 
for ENA rather than as a sub to PB.  I've already discussed this at length 
with Doug Smith, one of the principals at EDSA, and have e-mailed him a large 
quantity of design information and got EDSA kicked off to do the work.  Doug 
is supposed to send me a summary of EDSA's NTE costs for the tasks I 
identified to him, which I will forward to you as soon as I get it.

EDSA is now working on the Deerfield Beach landscaping on the basis of my 
conversation and e-mail, and their preliminary deliverables are due Friday 
March 16 (i.e., the end of this week).  We need to get a PSA and TL set up 
between ENA and EDSA to formalize this arrangement.  I would like you to 
draft these two documents ASAP so that we can get the proper contract 
documents in place as quickly as possible.

I will forward to you via separate e-mails the various documentation you will 
need to help put this together.

I'm working at home today (typical ENA vacation day!), so you can reach me on 
my cell or at home if you want to talk about this.

My numbers are:

Cell:  713-854-4971
Home:  281-655-0185

I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this.  Do you have someone 
available?  I need input by Monday, March 19. Nothing comprehensive, just a 
fatal flaw analysis under Connecticut law.

Thanks,

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able 
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The 
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone 
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the 
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an 
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can 
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Jeff,

I don't know if you are picking up email, but just in case,  here's a 
description of the Roundtable.

Kay
Dear Kay,

Confirming our discussion, The Texas Lawyer has asked King & Spalding to
organize a Roundtable Discussion of lawyers and business people to discuss
how the two professions relate to each other in the context of complex
business transactions. 

The Roundtable would take place privately in a conference room in our
offices with a court reporter recording the discussion, which would then be
published in an upcoming issue of the newspaper. Participants will have the
opportunity to edit their remarks before they are published. John Cogan will
be co-chairman of the proceedings with our partner, Chris LaFollette.  I
unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town. 

The Discussion will take place on Thursday, March 15, from 2 to 3:30. We
will hold a planning session over lunch in one of our conference rooms from
12:30 to 2. No other preparation would be required.

You would be a terrific representative from Enron to join us and provide
Enron's perspective. Please confirm your attendance as soon as you get the
internal approvals by calling John Cogan at 713.276.7371 or by e-mail at
jcogan@kslaw.com.

Best regards,
John

John,

I would hestitate to give up the option to TurboPark this project, unless the 
commercial team commits that there is no way Enron will ever want to progress 
with the site beyond permitting.  As you know, there is no going back once we 
give up that optionality.  

Good catch, Renee.

Hi there,

Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of 
both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I 
want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.

Thanks,

Bill/Dale-

Lee Moore pointed out what he thought was an inconsistency in the definition
of Heat Rate in 1.41, relative to the rest of the document for Peformance
Testing (Exhibit F) and the concept of guarantees based on Adjusted
Electrical Output and Adjusted Heat Rate.  As a result, we redlined the
definition of 1.41 to be sure all understood that Heat Rate calculations for
the purpose of the Performance test would based on Output measured at the
generator terminals net of Unit auxiliary loads as measured during the test.

Hope this helps your reach agreement on the EPC side of things.

Regards,

Lee

Bill/Dale/Kay-

I've made redline edits with regards to LVCII performance guarantee values
in Section 10.7 for output and heat rate based on the Feb 8, 2001 guarantee
sheet.

Dale, please send revised LVC II facility agreement to reflect Units 25-28
with appropriate schedules for price, delivery, payment and termination
schedules at your earliest convenience.

The units 19-20 and 23-24 that are currently reflected in this document will
be left in E-Next (Turbopark).  The schedules for price, delivery, payment
will remain the same for these units.

Thanks,

Lee

Kay:  We will do a fatal flaw review and follow up.  I am following up with

is well.  It sure sounds like you all are just buried.  Speak to you soon.

I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this.  Do you have someone
available?  I need input by Monday, March 19. Nothing comprehensive, just a
fatal flaw analysis under Connecticut law.

Thanks,

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in
the equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that
an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.
Can you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

Mark approved it this am.  Hopefully, good publicity which will make Mark 
glad he approved it.  They usually take pictures to go with the article, so I 
have to see if I need a new, clean, white shirt.  Gotta look good! Makeup and 
everything.  Wonder how I lose 15 lbs by Thursday?

Way cool! I hope you get it ok'ed. So what do you think about having your
thoughts published for all to read? NM

FYI.
Dear Kay,

Confirming our discussion, The Texas Lawyer has asked King & Spalding to
organize a Roundtable Discussion of lawyers and business people to discuss
how the two professions relate to each other in the context of complex
business transactions.

The Roundtable would take place privately in a conference room in our
offices with a court reporter recording the discussion, which would then be
published in an upcoming issue of the newspaper. Participants will have the
opportunity to edit their remarks before they are published. John Cogan
will
be co-chairman of the proceedings with our partner, Chris LaFollette.  I
unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town.

The Discussion will take place on Thursday, March 15, from 2 to 3:30. We
will hold a planning session over lunch in one of our conference rooms from
12:30 to 2. No other preparation would be required.

You would be a terrific representative from Enron to join us and provide
Enron's perspective. Please confirm your attendance as soon as you get the
internal approvals by calling John Cogan at 713.276.7371 or by e-mail at
jcogan@kslaw.com.

Best regards,
John

I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take 
Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.  Supposed to rain this weekend anyway, 
so Monday is soon enough. I would just as soon not have a Sharon appointment 
so we have that flexibility.  Plus, there is the possibility that I might 
need to go to FW for my dad.  Michael can go to FW with me if I need to go - 
he would be great company for me. I've thought about taking  him to Moody 
Gardens, or do some other fun stuff as an alternative.   The long term 
weather forecast for Houston and Palacios is glorious for that week, but you 
never know.  I don't mind taking him by myself.  I can do most of the fishing 
stuff, although I don't know squat about artificials.  If I do go I would 
like to take Rosco.  Since my folks have an internet connection I can keep up 
with a little work and write you, too.

For your info. 
Jerry Fox called to tell me that a decision has been made to by Peoples to
withdraw the Petitions for Approval of the PGL and North Shore Master Sales
Agreements. Jerry says this has been discussed with Enron. According to
Jerry, the intent is to proceed with some of the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement under exceptions to the affilliated interest approval
requirements. (As you may recall, we discussed the possibility that some
PGL/North Shore-enovate transactions may be expempt from the approval
requirement before the Peitition was filed. ) At this early stage of the
approval filing, the ICC Staff has not submitted testimony explaining its
opposition to approval. From the Staff's data requests, however, it appears
that they are not convinced that there is sufficient customer (i.e.,
public) benefit from establishing a contract between a utility and an
affiliated entity to perform the transactions contemplated by the Master
Sales Agreement when Peoples/North Shore acknowledge in the Petition that
there are other contracts in place with non-affiliates to perfrom the same
type of transactions. The Petition takes the position that the contract
with enovate is beneficial in the same respect that each non-affiliate
contract has benefit. ICC Staff (apparently) feels that the incremental
benefit of one more contract is not enough to offset perceived risks
associated with blanket approval of affilliate transactions under the
Agreement. It may be possible persuade staff to change its position if we
can show that the agreement with enovate will have a more significant effec
on PGL/Noth Shore that one of the non-affiliate agreements. In other words,
evidence of something unique or special about what enovate brings to the
table is what could turn this around (if you are interested in doing so.) .
Please call with any questions you may have.

Gentlemen,

Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land option 
agreement.  The most significant change is that it is clear that the option 
payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the purchase 
price.  There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re assignment) that the 
assignee remains responsible for any liability arising prior to assignment.  

I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.  Please 
advise if this version is acceptable.  Also, please let me know if you would 
like for me to have a redline version prepared.

Kay

Just a reminder that I am planning on being on vacation with my son next 
week.  My clients are aware of these plans, and I have hopes that things will 
go without a hitch.  I will be able to retrieve email and voice mail.

Kay

Well, I know Jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have Rosco to 
aim at.  I guess Kaley will have to growl at Jack just to stay in practice.

I should add that Kendall is due at the end of next week, and if something 
urgent comes up, I could have to cover for Carlos.  Not likely but you know 
how the baby stuff goes.

I think Rosco is going to be at least 70 pounds, although I don't have any 
information to go on.  You mentioned that his pop is a big dog, so I guess we 
should expect him to be big.  Maybe one of those tall Labs.  I just hope his 
personality stays the same.

Kay

I agree about skipping Sharon. It is his Spring break after all. I will tell
her.
Hey, don't worry, Michael can teach you about artificials! Just ask him!
I don't know about you taking Rosco. I mean it doesn't matter to me you
understand. But what will Kalie and Jack do without him? They will be so
lonely! Who will chase Jack around when he's trying to pee or bite him on
the ears? And who will be lazy with Kalie during the day? I'm just thinking
about them don't you know...NM

ps...
Have you noticed how tall Rosco is getting? It hit me today as I was
watching him with Jack. He's almost as tall as Jack! He's going to be really
big!!

I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take
Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.  Supposed to rain this weekend

My dad is having some health issues, so they couldn't commit to next week.  I 
cleared cancelling the conference with Elizabeth, so please take the steps 
necessary to call that off.  Carlos' wife is due the 23rd, so I may need to 
cover for  him.  We'll see.  I do hope to take Michael and Rosco to Palacios 
where we can hang out, fish, play in the sand, etc.  In other words, no big 
plans, which I'm happy about.  I think Neil will miss Rosco as much as 
Michael, but he probably looks forward to having the house to himself for a 
few days.

Sheila,

I hate to do this to you at this late date, but I finally figured out that
the execution copy that we received via this e-mail of 2-12-01 was not the
final executed version (WAS:83641.7).  The final executed version (file
WAS:83641.8) is attached.  The changes were made by Alan Larsen on January
19, 2001 to paragraphs 6.1.2 Payment Schedule (from $ 10,892,000.00 to $
11,572,250.00)and 6.1.3 Retention Letter(s) of Credit (amount changed to $
720,535).  This was due to the agreed upon scope and storage changes we
determined were necessary at time of execution to avoid a change order.

Please distribute accordingly on your side.  Also, I never received my
original signature pages, plus other consent documents.

Also, I'm trying to get our copy of the executed CA Development I and CA
Development II contract documents.  Plus the E-Next Generation contract,
too.  (Who says we're going paperless.)

Randy,

I have just spent an interesting 1/2 hour with Ron Vorhees.  Ron had an MOU 
with EPCC/CIGSA to bid a contract with Pemex to put the Titan II to work back 
in March of 1998.  We obviously lost the bid, but Vorhees claims that we have 
used his company's name and expertise to secure the two drilling rig 
contracts PM-4036 & PM-4037. 

Vorhees also claims that there is a signed agreement between Enron and his 
company to provide consulting services at $125 USD/hour, with a minimum of 80 
hours/month, or $10,000/month, for a duration of 985 days starting in March 
of 1998.  I read the unsigned copy that Ron Vorhees gave me and it is 
specific for the Titan II project that we lost.  I doubt that this agreement 
was actually signed, but in any case I would like you to verify your files  
to see if you could locate such agreement.

Based upon the above, Vorhees feels that Enron owes him $273,000 USD.  I told 
him that Enron will not pay him anything based upon the information that he 
showed me.  He may try to get us either through an alledged agreement or 
because he feels that he was misled when he dealt with EEPC back in 1998.  
His contacts were Bob MacMillan and JamieDunlap.

Dear Mr. Keffer,

Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate 
person with the Astros organization. In keeping with our family tradition, I 
am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a "behind 
the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works. 

This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an 
honor to be a part of it.  Any assistance you can give in putting me in touch 
with the right person would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Kay,
See the proposed wording, below.  This is the only contract text issue I am
aware of.
Other than the items mentioned in my e-mail of June 1st/2nd (on the
consolidation agreement) and finalization of the "letter agreement" (you got
my fax), we are there.
Implied in the above, is that at this point I think the split agreement
approach would get us to closure faster.

I have no problem with their proposed addition as it applies to the onshore
contract.  However, I would recommend modifying it as follows:

      If Purchaser is obligated to make any payment to Seller that
is subject to any withholding tax, then Purchaser shall remit the
appropriate withholding tax to the proper governmental authorities, and
Purchaser shall then remit the net amount of the payment (i.e., the gross
payment minus the applicable withholding tax) to Seller.  Seller agrees to
provide Purchaser with an original tax receipt, in Seller's name, indicating
remittance by the Purchaser of the amounts withheld.  Failure to provide
this receipt within a reasonable period of time will result in the amount
withheld becoming payable to the Seller.

      Tim,
      Enron wants to add this to the end of Clause 5.2.2.
Attached is the latest version of the On-Shore Contract for reference.
      Please let me know your opinion.
      We can talk to Enron about this if appropriate.
      Thanks,

I got the same response from Mike and Ken.  Doesn't sound good.  

Kay--this is not a good evening for computers.  When I tried to print the 
option agreement, it came through as gibberish.  Could you try sending the 
doc again?  Thanks.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 07/24/00 07:41PM >>>
Gentlemen,

Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land
option agreement.  The most significant change is that it is clear that the
option payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the
purchase price.  There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re
assignment) that the assignee remains responsible for any liability arising
prior to assignment.

I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.  Please
advise if this version is acceptable.  Also, please let me know if you
would like for me to have a redline version prepared.

Kay

Reagan,

Specifying it is for infrastructure costs may cause heartache.  

Don't worry, I'll do the legal work!

Kay

Kay:  Based on my conversation with Marvin, I think he is looking for 
something like this:

EPMI would be guaranteed a monthly minimum fee as reimbursement for 
infrastructure costs calculated as the amoritized capital costs over the 
contract period.  The monthly minimum will be considered to be met provided 
EPMI's 40% share exceeds the monthly amoritized cost calculation.  Otherwise 
"The Cities" agree to pay the shortfall between the guaranteed minimum and 
the profits acrued to EPMI during the particular month.

Just thought I'd communicate it a little better after I thought about some 
more.  Try it on for size, see what David thinks, ....

Thanks,

Reagan

Anytime in the next hour is good, since I didn't eat breakfast.  I would love

I called and left Steve a brief message.  I'll patch you in when he calls

When you talk to them, find out if they have talked to Lee Johnson, since we 
need to make sure he is on board before we sign the letter agreement.

Thanks,

Also, two fyi's -- I left Jeff a msg on the 2/5 year confidentiality spilt 
and he left back saying that approach was fine, but anything over 5 we should 
go to Mark with.

Left a msg with Mark and he approved A&K (although late afternoon, when BG 
asked about whether I'd hired my outside counsel, I had to tell her that I 
was waiting to hear from MH.)  I think I'm off to the RB career path.

Thanks John. 
I got a huge kick out of Paige struggling with the email to you.  She's a 
terrific writer, but had horrible writer's block.  I think it was the dose of

Hi,

I saw your posting concerning the kayak. Do you still have it?  Where is it

Thanks,

Details.  Do they want one of the turbines before Sept?

   
	
	

FYI
Chris, prior to our call this afternoon, I wanted to alert you to one term
that was discussed in our Monday telephone call that I inadvertently left
out of the letter you received yesterday.  Specifically, we would want the
Enron carry to continue until September 1, 2001.  Thus, Northwestern would
be obligated to close on the transaction (and get Enron its money) on or
before this date.  Again, this specific term was discussed in the Monday
call and left out of the letter.  I apologize for the oversight.  Let me
know if this is a problem.

Hi,

Allyson,

Thank you for the update.

Is not having the CPCN an absolute bar to beginning construction?  What are 
the risks?

Thanks,

Kay

Sami Salib of the Public Staff is drafting the agenda item that will go on
the Commission's Open Agenda Conference for approval to establish the
procedural schedule for the CPCN application (intervention dates, intervenor
testimony, rebuttal testimony, etc).  Although he wanted to schedule the
evidentiary hearing for the last week in September, the Commisssion's
calendar is currently full.  So he has tentatively scheduled it for Monday,
October 2.  The problem with that is that it makes it virtually impossible
to meet the November 1 construction date if the Commission allows the
customary 30 days after the hearing in which to file briefs and proposed
orders.  I urged Sami to please see if he could calendar the hearing for the
third week in September.  

One of the things that ENA will have to do is to have notice published in
newspapers in the Rocky Mount area for several consecutive weeks prior to
the hearing so that affected persons will have an opportunity to comment.  I
am trying to get Sami to place the draft agenda item and procedural schedule
on the Commission's July 31 Open Agenda Conference so that the notices can
start to run August 7.  That action, along with scheduling the hearing for
the third week in September, will make it far more likely than not that the
CPCN will issue before November 1.  

Failing that, we can work with the Public Staff to shorten the period within
which to file briefs and proposed orders after the hearing to three or
preferably two weeks.  It will not be difficult to do that if there are no
intervenors, or if the intervenors do not object.

Sami has promised to let me know by tomorrow when the agenda item will go
before the Commission, and the dates in the procedural schedule.  Please
call me if you have questions.  Thanks.

Eileen-attached is the resume of the daughter of the good client, Kay Mann
of Enron (and a rabid fan of the Astros), I spoke to you about. Thanks
again-John

Dear Mr. Keffer,

Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate
person with the Astros organization. In keeping with our family tradition,
I am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a
"behind the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works.

This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an
honor to be a part of it.  Any assistance you can give in putting me in
touch with the right person would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Paige Record

Sent by: Ben Jacoby@ECT
As you may know, we are proceeding with development of the Ft. Pierce, FL 
project using one of the MHI 501F turbines. Several contract issues need to 
be sorted out with MHI, including the execution of a break out contract for 
the Ft. Pierce unit, certain scope changes, and a NOx guarantee of 25PPM. 
There are obviously other issues related to off balance sheet financing that 
will need attention. 

Brett, Mike and I have decided to have a weekly conference call to make sure 
these issues are being addressed. We would all appreciate each of you being 
available next Thursday at 10AM CST for a kick off call so that we can 
hopefully figure out exactly what we're dealing with. If you can't attend in 
person, we'll set up a call in number.

Please let me know your availability at your earliest convenience. Also, 
please feel free to invite others which you feel should be involved in this 
kick off discussion.

Lastly, for purposes of the break out contract, Brett has provided below an 
electronic copy of the executed contract for both units.

Your mom just called and said your dad's surgery will be at 2:30 p.m. 
Tuesday, March 20th.  They will be there by noon on the 20th, and the surgery 
will last 1.5 hours and then they'll watch him for 2 more hours before they 
put him into ICU. They are hoping he'll only be in the hospital 48 hours.

I have a change in plans next week.  My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth, 
so I will be heading that way on Monday.  I was planning to be on vacation 
anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I 
would not have had otherwise.  I will manage client expectations accordingly.

Kay

For better or worse, all the folks under the heading "Origination"  and 
"Development" are ours, although Kathleen has a special role with Development.

I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information 
regarding some of the titles for various employees.  Please verify that the 
titles are correct for everyone in your group.  The ones that I made changes 
to are in red.

Thanks, Paula.

I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet.  Please 
use this new file as opposed to the one I sent earlier.

Please review the attached org chart for March and submit any changes by noon 
tomorrow.  It is imperative that all of the information on the attached file 
is accurate, including titles, as this information is being given directly to 
John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen.

Thanks, Paula.

Here's the version showing revisions.
Kay--I finally got it to blackline correctly.  Here it is.  Also attached is 
a sample availability provision (actually 2 different versions).

I do not think the prior e-mail got through to Kay.

Are either of you familiar with  this project? We have had no contact with 
the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any 
structuring goals.

Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to 
issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to 
support the ENA work. 

I now understand that someone at ENA/Enron Mexico/Enron Wholesale has signed 
an EPC  contract with ABB for this project.

I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response.

Hi Wilson,

I spoke with David Hunt, and he has no problem with you representing Enron 
Power Marketing in the proposed transaction with Clarksdale and Yazoo City.  
Please let me know if you  have any other potential conflicts.

Hi Rose,

Was the Blue Dog override letter signed for TurboPark?  I didn't see it in 
the TurboPark closing docs.  Of course, I could have missed it.

Thanks,

Kay

Sounds like a good match with Ruthie and Murphy.

My old dog, Kaley, is really sounding bad.  She has a cough that just won't 
quit, which has gotten worse over the last couple of years.  I think it is 
her heart.  She's 11 years old, and moves slowly.  

Rosco owns the familiy now.  He is so quiet, but friendly.  Just likes to 
hang around close to everyone.  I'll miss him when I'm in FW.  

ckm

Are you having fun yet!!!!!!

The vet said Murphy has an ear infection so that's probably why he's been 
scratching.  Otherwise, he's in great shape.  31.5 pounds and he also thinks 
Murphy is less than one year old.  He said Murphy is a wire terrier cross.  I 
looked that up, and it's an ugly dog!  He definitely doesn't have that face, 
it looks more like a Jack Russell.  You should have seen him running behind 
Ruthie this morning.  All four legs were off the ground - he definitely has 
kangaroo in him!  He must have had a rough day though because Ruthie was 
wanting to mess with him, and he snapped at her.  He's like Ric, you can only 
push him so far!  I'll try and take some pictures this weekend.  Just thought 
I'd update you on the kids!

Do you need something for lunch?

There were technical difficulties with the last one - this should be easier 
to read.

Kay
 - clnVEPCO.doc

I took her in a while back for the cough, plus she goes in every 6 months for 
kennel cough and hearworm test.  They haven't said much and I haven't asked.  
Afraid to, I guess.  I got Kaley when I was with my former boyfriend, and 
she's been through it all with Paige and me.

Have you taken Kaley to the doctor or are you afraid to.  We lost our 
childhood dog when he was 12.  I cried for weeks!  Rosco sounds like a cool 
dog.  

Oh, I miss Ruthie when we go on trips.  I swear they are like children.  You 
certainly do get attached.

Has anyone given any more thought to the need for this structure with Hanover 
?

Attached are the form of Letter Agreement and LLC Agreement redacted for 
Hanover for you all to forward.  As for the turbine contract, Stephen you 
have a copy of that but may want to delete E-Next's name and anything else.

You lost me.  We talked to Jake about it, and the two issues were GE consent 
and accounting treatment.  At least that's how I remember it.

Kay

I thought that we had this conversation yesterday on the reason for the 
structure?

I didn't redact it, but Ben might have a copy.  I can email you the 
electronic file of the intact document.

Thanks!  I really could use a copy of the Blue Dog contract, especially if 
you redacted it to give out to bidders.  Thanks!

by e-mail.

Janette Elbertson

My guess would be the week of the 4th of July, then again sometime in 
August.  I agree that he really should see it.  If you want to take him, 
that's great, or we will be glad to take him.

Kay

   I keep forgetting to discuss this with you.  The Lion King will be
here for the entire month of July, and Michael MUST see it.  I don't care
whether you two take him or me, but it's an absolute.  This will be my third
time to see it.  The tickets go on sale around June 1.  Do you know yet when
you will be on vacation?

Dear Kay:

Welcome to the Body Shop!  We have reviewed your health history questionnaire 
and have cleared you to begin exercising at your earliest convienence.  We 
look forward to seeing you.  If you have any questions please feel free to 
ask myself or any Body Shop Staff for assistance.  

In Health,

Joshua Wooten
Health and Fitness Specialist

Here's a version:

You probably know this, but the most important stuff is:

assignment 
exercise dates (get more time than you could possibly need, because you'll 
need it)
scope (if available), schedule guarantees
option price not credited against purchase price (and lately, not refundable)

Lisa Bills, Herman Manis, Rose Engeldorf and Matt Berry typically review 
these.

I figured it was a long shot.  Have a great weekend.

Hi Pete,

There's been a Plan B developed on the LV Co Gen project.  We are seriously 
exploring the possibility of selling the current LV Co Gen turbines to a 
third party, by selling the equity in a project co which acquires the 
turbines.  Sound familiar?  Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called 
Salmon somethingorother llc.  

I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need 
to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent.  I 
believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on 
for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the "new" Salmon 
contract.  I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale 
can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with.  Carlos Sole  is 
the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats.  His number is 713 345 
8191.

I will be out of the office next week, but will periodically check my voice 
mail if  you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kay

As mentioned in my other email...

Stephen Thome@ECT

Tony, Rick,

Here is a redline of the original turbine contract that I sent out.  The 
numbering has been corrected and some changes made to section 10.7.

Let me know how your review is proceeding.  Our counsel has suggested that 
you may want to make a trip to Houston to go over the contracts if you have 
substantive comments.  We would like to have executable versions by close of 
business Friday.

Steve

Ok, by now you think I've lost my mind. I can accept that.

I believe this is the most current version which should form the basis of the 
Salmon LLC contract (formerly known as LV Co Gen facility agreement).

Kay
lee.johnson@ss.ps.ge.com on 03/12/2001 04:17:06 PM
Bill/Dale/Kay-

I've made redline edits with regards to LVCII performance guarantee values
in Section 10.7 for output and heat rate based on the Feb 8, 2001 guarantee
sheet.

Dale, please send revised LVC II facility agreement to reflect Units 25-28
with appropriate schedules for price, delivery, payment and termination
schedules at your earliest convenience.

The units 19-20 and 23-24 that are currently reflected in this document will
be left in E-Next (Turbopark).  The schedules for price, delivery, payment
will remain the same for these units.

Thanks,

Lee

Bill Williams asked me to forward the attached execution form of the
LM-6000 purchase contract.

The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  I
understand that we received it from GE, and that it is available only in
pdf format.

Thanks.

(See attached file: Training LM6000.pdf)(See attached file: LV Cogen Gas
Turbine Purchase Agreement - Version 5.DOC)

 - LV Cogen Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - Version 5_redline031201.DOC

Jake is ready to tell Lee who the purchaser is and get permission to "tell 
all".  I think that's a good way to go.

I have to confess that I didn't look at their comments to the turbine 
contract.  I will be glad to do it if you want.  Jake said that Bill Williams 
had some discussions with Delta, and he thought maybe some of their comments 
were no longer germane.  Bill has received their comments, but I don't know 
his reaction.

Kay

Dale Rasmussen@ECT
03/16/2001 05:10 PM
Jake is trying to chase me down to see if some proposed changes Delta wants 
to negotiate with GE look to be in the realm of reason.  Have you seen the 
comments?

Second:  In redacting the liability caps, etc. did you have a discussion with 
Lee Johnson about GE sensitivities?  Delta is expressing a need to see what 
the caps are.

Your thoughts?

Thanks for the quick turnaround.

Kay

Don't be too grateful.  I think Jake wants you to weigh in no matter what.  
He obviously values your opinion.

My personal opinion is you put the comments in front of Lee, and if he 
doesn't like them, the answer to Delta is no, we have no leverage to get your 
changes.

Reagan,

I haven't received an email from David Hunt yet.  I will make the changes you 
and I discussed last week, and perhaps we will get David's changes sometime 
today.

Kay

Federal jurisdiction and limit of liability verbage.  That's what comes to 
mind at this point.

Could you email me the most current version (I think it was March 3)?  

Thanks,

Kay

You were reading my mind.  What is the list of things he owes us?  David F. 
and I will call Marvin to report on the status.

Thank you,

Kay

I don't have any significant comments, but I picked up a couple of minor 
typos.

From a structure standpoint, I think Enron doing the construction (and taking 
price risk) may be a structuring challenge, but I understand that's a bridge 
to cross later.

Kay

PS  I hope Mark isn't reading this today!  Great wedding.

Reagan,

I don't suggest it, especially since this is not an "off the shelf" deal. 
There are so many moving parts to this deal it could slow it down in the long 
run to get someone else involved for a few days. It is like getting a new 
commercial guy involved for 4 days. I'll defer to the great and powerful Oz.  

I should be available most of the day, so let's see how things go.

Kay

Kay,  

Marvin is out of pocket right now.  If we do not hear from David Hunt this 
morning, is there someone running backup for you?

Reagan,

FYI, it would bother me if Marvin called our outside counsel.  If you want  
me to call David,  just ask.  I'll be glad to do it, although I don't suggest 
bugging the other parties' counsel too much.  It uses up relationship 
capital, and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want 
to incur.  

Another FYI -  I don't much like Enron commercial folks calling Enron outside 
counsel unless we've discussed it in advance.  It violates Enron policy.  So 
once we have outside counsel on board, you still deal directly with me, and 
I'll manage the outside resources.  It really works better that way.  

Kay

Kay-

I just called David Hunt and actually got him on the phone.  He said he was 
reviewing Marvin's and Bob's comments on His changes.  He committed to 
getting those to us directly.

Don't mean to lecture, especially via email.  Just trying to give some 
constructive suggestions!

Sheila,

If I were starting over again, there are a few things I would change.  First, 
the development fee as presented in this draft doesn't work.  Second, I would 
put all the put/call details in the llc agreement.  Third, I would make the 
put/call available anytime GE agreed to it.  The development fee has been 
discussed generally, but not fully vetted with Herman.

Kay

Here's a general description of the steps:

Letter agreement signed
Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC)
$ deposited in escrow
TurboPark notice given

Closing date:

TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption)
LLC signs breakout contract
Amended LLC, other closing docs executed
Money released from escrow to Enron
Enron pays off TurboPark

This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if 
you see a problem with this process.

Kay

Sounds like a plan, but do not sign a breakout contract in an Enron entity 
until you hear further.

Hey Andrea,

We are going to FW tomorrow, as my dad is having surgery to unclog one of his 
carotid arteries.  I'm kinda nervous about this one.  Everything else is 
going well.  Michael, Paige and Neil are all well and happy.  Paige has 
applied to the Astros for a summer job.  Seems like a long shot, but she 
really wants to do it.  Michael has a kid in his class named Colin Waters.  
His dad is the travel secretary for the Astros.  Unfortunately, I haven't met 
him yet.

I can't wait to hear about your reunion.  I know it will be a blast.  Have 
fun!

Been working at our Greenway Plaza office until the

I sure hope it is this week.  It will either be this week, or a while.  How's 
that for keen analysis?

It would seem to me that if we end up with breakout contracts signed by E 
Next, we should use the break out form, plus an override letter.  What do you 
think?

Last time I talked with Lee he was anxious to get the break out contract 
signed.  Your plan works fine as long as we can wait to sign the breakout 
contract.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

More org stuff.  Randy must now be with EWS Legal, since I see he is in an 
office on 38.

Kay

We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

Nothing is simple.

I had thought I would be the lawyer on the Mitsubishi consent, until I was 
removed two weeks ago in favor of Rose. Then I heard today from Ozzie that 
Rose was off and another ENA lawyer ( I don't know who) was heading up the 
effort with Mitsubishi. I didn't suggest you get involved, and as you can see 
I wasn't copied on any of the arrangements ( until you forwarded them to me

Jake received a call from Rick Vicens.  Apparently, Delta has agreed to our 
$68 mm in escrow at closing.  However, they have not agreed to the corp 
guarantee.  Can we structure our LLC to free us from any liability instead of 
having Delta's corp guarantee.

Steve

I like it....

Kay,

Regarding calculation of the profit, can we add the caviot that "a more 
comprehensive calcuation of the profit would be agreed to by the parties in 
the definitive agreement."??

Sorry I didn't come up with more concrete examples.  I'm really concerned 
about my dad, although I try to deny it.  

I still think that we should insulate ENA on the next deal.

Kay

Steve, per our phone conversation, the following are examples of post-closing 
risks that justify Delta's provision of a Parent Guaranty:

- Delta Affiliate issues a $5 million Change Order to GE, but doesn't have 
the money to pay for it; Enron decides to pay for that change order in order 
to maintain our relationship with GE and then Enron's recourse is limited to 
the Delta Affiliate that defaulted on the GE Change Order payment in the 
first place

- Delta Affiliate stops paying for the Insurance that the LLC must have; 
Enron decides to make the Insurance payments and then must recover the costs 
from the Delta Affiliate

- Despite its representations, Delta Affiliate has incurred a brokerage fee, 
defaults in that payment, Enron covers it and then must recover from Delta 
Affiliate

- Delta Affiliate incurs some third party personal injury liability and Enron 
becomes liable for it, and can seek recovery from the Delta Affiliate

- Delta Affiliate breaches the agreement and Enron seeks damages which are 
limited to what it can recover only from the Delta Affiliate

As a compromise, there could be a monetary cap on the guaranty that it be 
tied to the Transaction Value (ie $68 million)

I heard a rumor that Carlos Sole has been tasked with the Mitsubishi 
consent.  I'm sure he will do a great job.

Kay

Hi Carlos,

I should be easy to reach on my cell until around 930 Tuesday.  Feel free to

In my absence you can feel comfortable talking to Jeff.  He seems pretty

I have in hand the Ledford agreement.  My only comment is that on its face it

sole/exclusive remedy clause).  Does that occur by operation of law in 
Illinois?

Thank you for your assistance.

I'm out of pocket the rest of the week. I think the best description is the 
general Enron Corp description.  It is very generic, and is found at the 
bottom of all Enron press releases. If I get access, I'll forward it to you - 
unfortunately I can't access it now.  It is one of those "Enron is a leading 
blah blah blah" things.  Lots of help I am!

I know you don't have enough to do...

I can't access the press release part of the Enron intranet site.  There is a 
blurb that appears at the bottom of all Enron press releases, which is one of 
those Enron is a leading blah blah blah.  If you can easily find that blub, 
would you mind forwarding it?  

Sorry for asking.

interested in the units because of their timing.  I have advised him you are
also closely working with others for these turbines.

I've spoken to the Brunini firm in Jackson.

Kay

I spoke with my friend in Memphis on other matters and asked him MS law 
firms.  The name he suggested was Watkins, Ludlum, Winters & Stennis.  It's 
about 70 lawyers and is one of the oldest Jackson based firms.  Let me know 
if you're still shopping for counsel there.

FYI.  Please call me on Monday to discuss, if possible.

Thanks,

First order of business.  Again, we can discuss this on Monday.

I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a 
telephone call today.  I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos 
is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.  I really 
hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.  

Talk to you Monday.

NorthWestern has agreed to our request to remove the Corp guarantee from the 
letter.  We will change the dash to reflect the change.
Ben and Chris,

Attached is the revised Exclusivity Letter Agreement, black-lined to reflect
the changes agreed upon this afternoon.  Your timely efforts to move this
along for approval and execution within Enron is greatly appreciated.  I
look forward to hearing your comments soon.  Regards.

As best I can tell it isn't essential; however, it would probably be 
helpful.  I know you are on holiday, so if you have something else going on, 
I wouldn't worry about it.  I can always call you later.

Kay

I heard about this call yesterday. Am I to participate?

We are contemplating selling the Blue Dog turbines to NorthWestern.  I've 
been out of town with a sick dad, so I'm not clear who has been in the loop 
and who hasn't.  However, since these are TurboPark turbines, I wanted to 
make sure you are aware of the deal.  It is the commercial teams desire to 
enter into an exclusivity arrangement as soon as possible.  

Sorry for the short notice - today is the first day I've been able to pick up 
my email.

Kay

	
	

Kay,

FYI

Chris
Ben and Chris, after discussion with certain members of NorthWestern's
senior management, NorthWestern is offering Enron a $1.0 million
non-refundable payment in exchange for exclusivity until April 6, 2001.  In
effect, this brings the total purchase price for the two GE turbines to
$49.0 million.  The offer is subject to the terms of the attached
Exclusivity Letter.  Please call me as soon as you have reviewed to discuss
the timing considerations.

Hi Rusty,

Here's my only comment, which I sent directly to Karen.  

Kay

Karen,

I have in hand the Ledford agreement.  My only comment is that on its face it 
does not appear to limit the Ledford's to the relief described (no 
sole/exclusive remedy clause).  Does that occur by operation of law in 
Illinois?

Thank you for your assistance.

Kay

Hi Dan,

What's the latest with Suzanne?  Is she home yet?  Do you have her home 
number/address?

Thanks,

Kay

PS  I'm still out of town.

Thanks.  

We'll call you around 100.

Kay

I'm actually back in the office, so I'm available for the call.

Sorry to hear about your dad.

Chris,

Please do not ask outside counsel to participate in a call, undertake a task, 
or do anything without talking to me, Carlos, or another Enron lawyer 
first.   

You do not need to call Carolyn and tell her not to participate.  Carlos has 
taken care of this already.

Kay

  

   
	
	

Kay,

Are you available for a conference call today at 1:00 PM to discuss the 
NorthWestern deal/issues.  If so, I will ask Carolyn Campbell not to 
participate in the call.

Thanks,

Chris

Will there be a "pre-call" for the Enron team?

Kay

I'm still out of town, but now I have email access.  Did your CA get taken 
care of?

You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.  Do you have 
electronic copies of the development agreement?

Thanks,

Kay

I saw that Michael Young was included in the email regarding the 100 
conference call, so I thought he was planning on phoning in then as well.  
When will he be calling in?

I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements

have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will.

I hope everything is going OK.

With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via 
email to BPUB.  Mitch and I are reviewing the TEX/MEX agreements to determine 
an appropriate commercial structure with the intent of preserving as much of 
the "legalese" in the original agreements (i.e., the development agreement 
and the participation agreement) as possible.  Our major concern is to keep 
this off Balance Sheet.  

 I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions.  Would you consider 
having Aaron Roffwarg of B & P work on this agreement, he was previously 
involved in the drafting of the agreements and he knows all of the players 
and their habits.

Evidently Ben told Chris to call.  This is an on going problem.

Kay
	
	

No.  The primary focus of the call today is to get the exclusivity agreement 
executed.  I think NorthWestern is getting more comfortable with the 
structure of the deal.  If all goes well with the exclusivity agreement, we 
might go over a few contract points with NorthWestern.

Chris.

P.S.  I apologize for talking to outside counsel without your permission.  I 
do not mean to step on any toes, I was simply responding to Ben's 
request....you know how demanding he can be.  I hope you dad is doing well!

Re:  Acquisition of General Electric 7EA Turbines

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Pursuant to our discussions last week, the following summarizes the main=20
commercial terms agreed to by NorthWestern Corporation (=01&NorthWestern=01=
8) and=20
1.  Purchase Price:  NorthWestern will pay ENA $48.0 million for the Turbin=
es=20
(subject to adjustment as described below). [Adjusted how?  Need specific=
=20
reference. Is the statement that the payment is for the turbines consistent=
=20
with the structure?  Definitely sounds like a UCC deal,  for what that=01,s=
=20
worth.]
2.  Closing Date of Purchase:  The Purchase will close on a date on or prio=
r=20
to September 1, 2001, as selected by NorthWestern by not less than 30 days=
=01,=20
written notice to ENA,(provided that such notice may not be given less than=
=20
30 days after the signing of a definitive agreement relating to the=20
Purchase).  [What happens at closing?  Payment of the balance?  In the=20
interim are we going to be obligated to perform under the GE contract in a=
=20
certain manner?  Are we taking on implied obligations to NW?]
3.  Cash Down Payment:  NorthWestern will pay ENA an $8.0 million down=20
payment for the Turbines.  The first installment ($3.0 million) of the $8.0=
=20
million down payment will be due upon the signing of a definitive agreement=
=20
with ENA providing for the Purchase.  The second installment ($5.0 million)=
=20
of the $8.0 million down payment will be due at the earlier of (i) closing =
of=20
the Purchase, or (ii) July 15, 2001. [The remaining $40m due at closing, as=
=20
well as any other amounts due to changes, etc?]
4.  Liquidated Damages:   If, prior to the assignment of the Turbine Contra=
ct=20
[is proper reference to closing?], the purchaser under the Turbine Contract=
=20
receives any liquidated damages under the Turbine Contract, then ENA will=
=20
give notice thereof to NorthWestern as promptly as possible. [Then what?]
5.  Carry Period:  ENA will provide an interest-free carry on the unpaid=20
purchase price of the Turbines until July 15, 2001. If the closing of the=
=20
Purchase occurs after July 15, 2001, then the unpaid purchase price of the=

=20
unpaid purchase price of the Turbines ($40.0 million) for each day from, an=
d=20
including, July 15, 2001 to, but excluding, the closing date.
6.  Dual Fuel Conversion on Unit 2:  ENA will not proceed with this change=
=20
order to effect the conversion.  Instead, it will be the responsibility of=
=20
NorthWestern to effect the change order with GE.  [does this mean they will=
=20
be negotiating a change order while E Next is still the purchaser? Are we=
=20
committing to pay for the increase?  Does the purchase price increase?  Is=
=20
there a limit?]
7.  Unpaid Price of Second Turbine:  At the time of closing, one or more=20
installments of the purchase price of the second Turbine will be payable to=
=20
GE under the Turbine Contract (the =01&Unpaid Installments=018).  ENA will =
be=20
obligated to pay the Unpaid Installments to GE as they become due under the=
=20
Turbine Contract.=20
8.  Guarantees:   There will be no guarantee by Enron Corporation of any of=

the representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities or other obligation=

of ENA in connection with the Purchase.  All obligations of the LLC under t=

I think it is an East deal, so I wouldn't think it would be dumped on you.  I 
just think it is nice to see the good stuff.

Kay,

Just a thought....Bart Clark used to work in the coal business.  I've worked 
with Bart before and found him to be an excellent practical attorney and 
individual.  Would you consider using him?

Hi John,

I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements 
first, before we commit.  Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?  He might 
have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will.

Thanks for your understanding and patience this week.

Kay

I hope everything is going OK.

With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via 
email to BPUB.  Mitch and I are reviewing the TEX/MEX agreements to determine 
an appropriate commercial structure with the intent of preserving as much of 
the "legalese" in the original agreements (i.e., the development agreement 
and the participation agreement) as possible.  Our major concern is to keep 
this off Balance Sheet.  

 I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions.  Would you consider 
having Aaron Roffwarg of B & P work on this agreement, he was previously 
involved in the drafting of the agreements and he knows all of the players 
and their habits.

JMoore

Kay Mann
03/23/2001 11:39 AM
I'm still out of town, but now I have email access.  Did your CA get taken 
care of?

You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.  Do you have 
electronic copies of the development agreement?

Thanks,

Kay

Please put Carlos Sole on the notice list.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi there,

Feel free to leave me an email about anything you are working on, as I will 
be available next week and onward to cover for you.  In fact, if you want to 
stay home and go with KS to her dr's appt on Monday, I'll be there to cover.  
In fact, just PLAN to not be there, and if you are, it is a bonus.   I don't 
you worry about anything when it gets to be baby time.  If you do figure out 
remote access, I can email you questions and you can answer when it is 
convenient.

Paige is almost 21, Michael is 6.5.  It goes fast!!!

Ciao,

FYI.  I don't know what I think about this email.  I will say that I've heard 
good things about Clark, but haven't worked with him.  Also, there is a big 
difference between a transmission project and a power project, since 
tranmission assets are treated differently from an accounting standpoint.  
Obviously, I don't consider the question of who is handling this (internally 
or externally) to be resolved, pending further discussions.

Kay
Understand from John Moore that there is a new solid fuel power project being 
discussed for the Brownsville area, and that you will be involved.  I would 
really like to talk to you about this at your convenience.  As you may know 
from John, we have been very involved with the Tex Mex transmission line 
project that we have done with BPUB and that has just received board 
approval.  We have a very good relationship, I believe, with BPUB, the Port 
of Brownsville and their respective counsel from that transaction.  John also 
seems to believe the deals with BPUB and the Port will be structured along 
the same lines as the transmission project, and as the draftsmen for not only 
the docs with BPUB, but also the Port,  we are also obviously very familiar 
with these documents as well.  

Could we possibly talk about this project at your convenience?  We would 
really like to do a deal with you and your team and given our background on 
the first project, it would seem to make a lot of sense from your point of 
view as well.  I would be happy to drop by to discuss staffing, timing, etc. 
whenever it would work best for you.  

Many thanks - look forward to hearing from you.

Hi there,

Just confirming a 200 CST Enron team conference call.  Is this going to work 
for everyone, with the exception of Carlos, who is now excused?

Kay

Allyson says we can scratch around in the dirt a bit (I'm paraphrasing), so 
I'm sure some site preparation is ok.

I'm not sure I like her availability stuff as inserted. Maybe we should leave 
some space for some wording, but not give them actual language today.  It is 
such a big issue, I hate for us to get into a box which won't work.

I'm going to check around again for the OEC stuff.  I still haven't seen 
anything.

I'll tell Nancy we will meet her in her office around 11:00.

As for meeting with Herman, should J Keenan be included as well?

Kay

Opps.  I should add that Mr. Hodge has a free pass to miss this and all other 
NW phone calls.

Kay

Ben,

I'm at home if you need to reach me before the call, 713 973 6325.

Kay

So how do you say "bitch" in Spanish?

I have  a better chance of remembering "mamona".  I have to build up to the 
good stuff.

My home number is 713 973 6325.  If call notes picks up, try me on my cell at 
713 304 8716.  Did you find the fax?  You can fax it to me if that speeds up 
you getting out of the office.  Call and let me know.

Thanks,

Kay

I prefer "mamona" but "hija de su putisima madre" also has a nice ring.
Since I am at the office, would you guys like for me to conference you in
once the document arrives?  If so, what are your numbers?

Marisa can swear much better than me in Spanish.  Would "huevona" be
appropriate?  

So how do you say "bitch" in Spanish?

from a schedule standpoint.  

Talk to you tomorrow,

Regarding Fehr:

Per your e-mail below, you indicated that Hillary Fehr called you and asked 
what you needed from her.  I would think that we would definately need her 
phone number and current address.  Regarding any legal documentation, I have 
a call in to Karen Way requesting that she provide her input.

If I call to ask about dividing the check, she will undoubtedly say we have 
to do it.  From a legal perspective there is normally something called a 
Qualified Domestic Relations Order that we or other parties would require 
before splitting proceeds.  Can you find out what document they will need to 
produce to our satisfaction so that we don't breach the deal by splitting the 
check.  I guess we could write out two checks and make them out to Hillary 
AND Luke so they both have to cosign and can each deposit one check in their 
respective accounts.

As to sending the option renewal check out with the Greene document, I think 
that it would be better to send it along with the other $5000 check so they 
get more money in one instance.  I think my suggested cover letter said 
that.  How much longer before we send the deal out?

   
	
	

The Greene Amendment to Option and Amended Short Form of Option have been 
approved by Carlos, but not yet forwarded to the Greenes or their attorney.  
It was my understanding that you wanted to send the Option renewal premium at 
the same time we sent the proposed agreements.  Is that still the case?

With regards to the Fehr Memorandum, it is true that Karen way did not 
prepare a Memorandum for this Option, but I think I have a draft of one for 
them.  We definately need to get this taken care of and have the Fehr's 
execute it and get it recorded.  We need to send them an option payment by 
April 2, so we can send the Memorandum at that time.  Can you please find out 
if we should issue separate checks for the Fehrs?

Kathleen

03/23/2001 12:53 PM
I spoke to Mark Gershon at today and among other things we discussed, I 
mentioned that we were working on the Greene option agreement extension.  
What is the status of the extension ?

Secondly, I mentioned to Mark that I had heard from Hillary Fehr and she 
indicated that she and Luke were no longer married.  She wanted to know what 
we needed from her in that regard.  I told her to send us a brief letter 
stating that, and to ask that we send her a copy of any notices (of exercise 
of option or whatever) at her dad's address.  Apparently the plan is to have 
Luke continue to reside in the house in the interim, but she said "for now".  
I let her know that our option agreement precluded their selling the house 
and that it would be to their disadvantage to give up the potential upside 
anyway.

Mark pointed out that we need to make sure we have recorded Memorandum of 
Option Agreements for all of our agreements - particularly this one - so they 
dont try to sell anyway and have a lender do a title search and not find out 
that the property was encumbered with our option agreement.  I understood 
that we had not done memorandums for all of the parcels under option, and 
would appreciate an update and plan of attack to get them in place.

Thanks

Thank you so much.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the Rangers, and 
what a great place to see them.

The latest from Florida re: Pompano Beach.

Please respond to Rebecca.Walker@enron.com
By JEREMY MILARSKY
Staff Writer

March 24, 2001

Before the battle begins, it's a good idea to have some ammunition.

That's why at least four cities have agreed to pay $10,000 to an 
environmental engineering firm based in Syracuse, N.Y., to shore up 
information about Enron Corp. and its plan to build two power plants in 
Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach. 

Politicians in those cities want to have all the facts about the company and 
its plans when they attend a Monday evening public hearing hosted by the 
state Department of Environmental Protection. State officials planned the 
hearing, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at the Pompano Beach Civic Center, in order 
to hear concerns and comments about the state agency's plan to grant a permit 
allowing Enron to build the plant.

The cities -- which so far include Coconut Creek, Margate, Coral Springs and 
Parkland -- have hired O'Brien and Gere Engineering Inc. for $10,000, said 
Dave Rivera, assistant city manager of Coconut Creek. City commissioners in 
North Lauderdale are considering joining the deal. If they do, each city will 
pay the firm $2,000.

If they hope to sink Enron's plans, city officials concede the task won't be 
easy. The company has plants all over the world, and Enron CEO Kenneth Lay 
happens to be friends with President Bush.

"Do I think there's a chance to defeat them?" North Lauderdale Mayor Gary 
Frankel said. "Well, I bet they have more money than God. But we have to 
protect our interests."

A second element of the cities' deal with O'Brien and Gere calls for the 
engineers to look for any evidence the cities can use to ask the DEP for a 
formal administrative hearing on the proposed plants. 

"We're reviewing what has been submitted by Enron," said David Priddy, 
regional marketing manager for O'Brien and Gere. "We're prepping [city 
officials] for the Monday hearing, and we're advising them on the possibility 
of an administrative review."

Some people who live in and around Pompano Beach, as well as the politicians 
who represent them, have concerns about Enron Corp. The company wants to 
build a 510-megawatt plant south of Sample Road and east of Florida's 
Turnpike in Pompano, along with a similar plant on Green Road in Deerfield 
Beach.

Both plants would burn clean natural gas, and according to the company, there 
would be little effect on North Broward's air quality. Enron spokesman Eric 
Thode said he welcomes a review by O'Brien and Gere. He predicted the firm 
will conclude, as state officials did, that the plant will be mostly harmless.

"If they want to analyze the same things that the DEP did, they're going to 
find the same things," Thode said. "This is a state- of-the-art plant that 
will benefit South Floridians."

As a back-up fuel, the plant may burn diesel fuel, which emits some 
pollutants into the air. That has Coral Springs Mayor John Sommerer worried, 
because his city is often downwind from Pompano Beach. "We would agree to 
back off if they agree to burn solely natural gas," he said.

Opposition is also forming in Deerfield Beach, where Mayor Al Capellini has 
formed a committee to gather more information about Enron's plans for a plant 
there.

The public hearing for the plant's state permit will be from 7:30 to 9 p.m. 
Monday at the Pompano Beach Civic Center, 1801 NE Sixth St.

My recollection is that the original ABB contract was assigned into TurboPark 
without revisions/restatement/consent, or a break out contract.  I think EECC 
had the typewriter on the original contract.   I quickly  looked in my 
TurboPark binders, but didn't immediately find the ABB contract.  

There was a breakout contract done for the CA Development deal, and Pete 
Thompson (with AK out of DC) would have generated that document.  It wasn't 
approved by the TurboPark team since it was entered into by the Enron LLC 
post TurboPark.  I wasn't involved in the Fountain Valley transformer 
contract, but my guess would be that Pete Thompson worked on it.  The footer 
you described sounds like an AK footer.

Kay

Kay Mann did the Abb transformer contract and I think that she used A&K-- 
Paul Pepitone?

The Fort Pierce crowd is pressuring for a form of transforner contract.Of 
course it must be TurboPark compliant. Since we have just done a transformer 
agreement with ABB for Fountain valley and its all signed off on by ABB, 
TurboPark, Rose atal,  and the new project lenders, I would like to start 
with that form and ot reinvent the wheel.

The ABB form that is in the TurboPark closing binders has a footer that reads 
"WAS:83848.6". I assume that either A&K or LLGM had the typewriter. Sheila or 
Roseann, I would appreciate it if one of you could get the firm that has the 
document on their computers to send it out, with the attachments, so Bart and 
the Ft Pierce team could get to work on it. We also have the hard copy 
override letter with ABB that make the TurboPark corrections, and we can 
either add these directly to the contract or leave it as an override letter. 

Mr. Lund, can you check at NEPCO and see if anyone there has electronics on 
this?

Next, for equipment that will be bought by Purchase Order instead of under a 
contract, we need the TurboPark bits that go into the PO, since we will be 
getting a lot of requests to issue PO's next. Roseann, could you send us what 
you have in mind forthe PO's, or should we just take the override letter, add 
it into the PO form, and let you see what we are doing?

Last, Jim Davis called to see where we are in the TurboPark cycle and if 
issuing a PO or Contract (ie., making a commitment) is ok at this point. Jim, 
thanks for making sure the loops are closed.  Bart gave me a voice mail that 
we do not have a DASH approval or other authorization. Therefore I ask at 
this point that Jim not issue any paper on the project until we get clearance 
from Bart and Roseann. 

Thanks

 

JWVS

Amen.  To complicate things, the process is relatively new, so the 
originators/developers aren't experienced in working through it.

Pete,

Please send John Schwartzenburg a copy of the Fountain Valley transformer 
contract.  

Thanks,

Kay

Right.  

The original ABB contract was with West LB.  Right Kay?

=09=09More than 500 people packed the Pompano Beach Civic Center on Monday =
night in=20
a formidable display of opposition to Enron Corp.'s plans for a power plant=
=20
next to Florida's Turnpike.

Opponents arrived in buses chartered by condominiums. They came from=20
virtually all the cities of north Broward County, some holding signs, other=
s=20
clutching notes for statements they wanted to make. They included a member =
of=20
Congress, two county commissioners and a parade of city officials.

Enron officials insisted they weren't jarred by the display of opposition.=
=20
But spokesman Eric Thode acknowledged he hadn't seen anything like it in=20
other parts of the United States where the company has built plants.

The hearing was called by the state Department of Environmental Protection =
to=20
take comments on the agency's preliminary decision to issue the company a=
=20
permit. The agency had found that the 510-megawatt plant would not harm the=
=20
region's air quality.

But few people in the crowd were buying that. They expressed suspicion abou=
t=20
Enron's promise to run the plant only as a part-time, backup facility. They=
=20
said the region didn't need the power and that the company would simply sel=
l=20
it elsewhere. And they doubted whether state officials sitting onstage coul=
d=20
know everything about the possible harm the plant could cause.

"Don't let them tell us these chemicals are perfectly safe for us," said=20
Claire Hornstein, of Pompano Beach. "They do not know, and we're not na=12z=
?=20
enough to believe it."

Speakers expressed concern about their health and their children's health.

Craig Wolf, of Coconut Creek, said he had been in the hospital 47 times for=
=20
lung problems. He moved from Miami to escape the pollution, and now he fear=
s=20
it will follow him to his current home.

"This could cause me to end up in the hospital," he said. "Please don't do=
=20
this project.

Dan Mackey, of Coconut Creek, arrived with a hand-drawn sign that read,=20
"Think of Our Kids. Stuff the Stacks." Aware of the company's political=20
influence, such as its close ties to President Bush, Mackey said he wondere=
d=20
how much of a chance opponents had.

"We're afraid of Enron," said Mackey, who has a 10-year-old daughter. "We=
=20
don't feel we're in very good shape against them."

U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., spoke against the project, asking the DEP=
=20
officials seated in front to consider public health first.

"I think the people in this room and every resident of Broward County is ow=
ed=20
a presumption that the state will give every benefit of the doubt to health=
,"=20
he said.

Also speaking against the plant were County Commissioners Kristin Jacobs an=
d=20
Ilene Lieberman. A procession of mayors and commissioners from the cities=
=20
around Pompano Beach took turns at the microphone.

"I worry about the young kids with asthma and the seniors with emphysema,"=
=20
said Coconut Creek Commissioner Becky Tooley. "Are you going to take away=
=20
somebody's last breath just to make some money? I don't think so."

Thode, the Enron spokesman, expressed irritation at the statements from the=
=20
politicians.

"The thing that gets me is that we've met with these people, given them the=
=20
facts, and they continue to say things that are not true," he said. "Sellin=
g=20
outside the state of Florida -- not going to happen. The only way we operat=
e=20
is when a utility needs the electricity."

The DEP is scheduled to work on its final permit. But four cities have file=
d=20
a request to delay the permit so they can petition for an administrative=20
hearing.

The real decision on whether the plant gets built could belong to the Pompa=
no=20
Beach City Commission. The commission is scheduled to vote April 10 on=20
whether to rezone 28 acres for the plant from industrial to utility. At thi=
s=20
point, it appears the vote will be close.

"It's not what we need in our neighborhood," said Jim Story, of Deerfield=
=20
Beach. "It's not what we need for our families, for our health, our propert=
y=20
values. We don't like the traffic that the fuel trucks will cause. I've liv=

Perhaps they'd like to put in a smelting plant."

Hi there,

Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of 
both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I 
want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.

Thanks,

Kay

These are both pending, but just so you know they exist, I'm sending this 
along.  Once these are signed I'll send you copies.

I had a brief conversation with Herman Manis, and he tells me that there is a 
different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants.  
Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power 
development projects easier.  In the past, we ran into problems anytime we 
wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.  Herman tells me 
that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance 
of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant.  
This change in focus should make power development deals easier to 
structure.  

I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose 
Engeldorf.  Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the 
West this week, so it may be a bit before we can get it set up.  A meeting 
with Herman would also be helpful.  Maybe we can buy him lunch and quiz him 
on these new developments.

Kay

Thanks for the reply.  I found it on her desk!

Hi there,

I participated in an FFA auction with Matagorda County Fair, and gave my
assistant the receipts to fill out the matching forms.  Unfortunately, she
has since had surgery and isn't in the office.  The receipts are no longer
on her desk, and the current temporary assistant doesn't know anything
about it.  I was wondering whether a prior temp might have sent them in.
Please let me know.

Thanks,

Tonight is yoga night.

ckm

I'm just getting out of a training class.
My bet is it will be cancelled.
I would love to take my bride out to dinner. If you do yoga Thursday we
could do dinner Friday. How does that sound? Let me know what you think and
I will write Charlotte. NM

I wonder if the Peckers game tonight will be a rain out.

Did you read Charlotte's email?  Are you interested?

Kay

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

I hope the freeway wasn't too bad.
Maybe we can make some of Brain's ball games. I think Michael would enjoy
going.
Love, Neil

Neil,

Hope you and Michael can make one or two of the 'Peckers games. Here is
the schedule:

March 28  8:00 p.m. Sidewinders
April 4   8:00 p.m. Warriors
April 7   4:00 p.m. Red Sox
April 11  6:00 p.m. Mustangs
April 16  6:00 p.m. Cardinals
April 19  6:00 p.m. Sidewinders
May 1     6:00 p.m. Mustangs
May 5    12:00 p.m. Cardinals
May 9     8:00 p.m. Sidewinders
May 12   10:00 a.m. Red Sox
Playoffs- To be announced- Probably double elimination

Go 'Peckers!

much grass

I don't see a problem with it.

Kay and Lisa:

   We should probably let Gisele Rankin know by tomorrow morning
whether we agree with the proposal to revise the procedural scheduling order
to include a provision which will require final substantive orders to be
presented to the Commission by October 10.

   What are your thoughts?  Neither Allyson nor I can think of a
downside to agreement, and in fact we feel that it would be in our best
interest to agree to the October 10 date.

   Please advise.  Thank you.

Jonathan M. Fine

Raleigh, NC 27612
TEL: (919) 420-1700
FAX: (919) 420-1800
http://www.kilstock.com

Attached is an e:mail from Gisele Rankin regarding the procedural schedule I
described in my e:mail this morning.  I will fax it on to you immediately
upon receipt.  As I explained earlier, it will help expedite matters
considerably if we get the agenda before the Commission on July 31.  I had
planned to take care of the publication of notice.  Please let me know if
that is not allright.  I will follow up with you today after you receive the
proposed order, but would strongly  recommend agreeing to a proposed order
due date of October 10 as that represents the best chance of getting timely
approval.  If there are no (or limited) interventions, compliance with the
October 10 date should not be difficult.

I have just faxed you an agenda item, proposed order and public notice
for Enron's application for a certificate.  This has to be finalized by
early tomorrow morning.  In the memo attached to the fax, I offered to
put a proposed order due date (of October 10th) in the proposed
procedural order to expedite getting an order by November 1st.  That is
much more doable than moving the hearing into September.  Please let me
know as soon as possible if Enron can live with this.

(Please remind Enron that it has to publish notice once a week for four
weeks pursuant to G.S. 62-82 (it isn't discretionary) and then we have
to have time for complaints (ten days pursuant to the statute - although
we're going ahead and setting this for hearing), time for interventions,
and time for prefiled testimony.  Late September is pretty much as early
as a hearing could be held even if we didn't need time to investigate NC
Power's bidding process (and the last week of September is booked
already according to Sami Salib)..

Whichever is better for Charlotte.

So what night is better for you? I forgot about the offer for tickets to the
ball game Friday. Do
you want to do dinner Thursday and the ball game Friday? NM

Marvin and Bob,

Attached is the most recent version of the LOI.  This version includes 
revisions resulting from conversations between David Hunt and Kay Mann.  The 
Beck comments are also included.  

David Fairley and I will call to follow-up.  In the meantime, feel free to 
call with any questions.

Thank you,

for your information and email folder
Last night Marvin Carraway, General Manager of Clarksdale Public Utilities, 
presented our LOI to his board.  They approved it, and he signed it.  
Thursday night Bob Priest, General Manager of Yazoo City Public Utilities, 
will present to his board and sign it as well.  The two cities formed a joint 
action agency called Mississippi Delta Electric Agency (MDEA).  

Everyone should have received the LOI via email on Monday.  Let me know if 
you didn't.

We need to have MDEA functional by May 1 to coincide with their exit from the 
Municipal Electric Agency of Mississippi (MEAM).  David Fairley and I are 
planning to visit Clarksdale and Yazoo City Monday and Tuesday to talk with 
them about all the activiy that is about to start up.

In order to identify and coordinate all of this, we would like to have a team 
meeting.  If I left anyone off of the distribution list, please have them 
attend, and I'll get them added.

Time:   11.30 am Thursday morning (3/29/01)
Duration: We have the room for 2 hours
Place:  EB3321
Food:  Lunch provided

I am pulling together an agenda/list of known issues and will email out later 
today.  If I don't get to everyone before then, send any ideas/issues to me 
by email.

Thanks,

Hi Karen,

Sounds familiar.

I'm sure you checked this, but in some of the GE contracts, the parent 
guarantee provision is under the purchaser's responsibilities section, near 
the beginning of the contract.  A strange place for it.

Good luck,

Kay

Hi Wilson,

Can you open this attachment?

Kay
Attached is the final version of the LOI for Clarksdale and Yaxoo City.

Gentlemen,

Attached is a clean version of the LOI.  Originals are being sent to Bob and 
Marvin by FedX tonight.

Regards,

Kay

Michael is off school April 13 and 16.  I have 3 deals which are supposed to 
close around then, so I'm not optimistic.  If possible, I will take at least 
one of those days.

On the summer camp, if we use a camp by you, we will probably lose Charlotte 
for the summer.  Does that matter to you?

Kay

Remember the count down!

I really think I have died and gone to hell.

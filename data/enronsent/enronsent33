because MG is by no means a credit risk by any definition."
 The only other document relating to the metal that I would like to have is
evidence that Aluminum of Siberia did pay Unimetal for the metal in
question. Could you lay hands on that?
 I will attempt to send you a draft of the proposed letter to the Bad Guys
later this evening in the hope that we can discuss on Tuesday.

Pleased to recap CURRENT situation as follows:

On Friday 7th July, Judge Garbis (District of Maryland) ordered that the
attachment of our metal be vacated (i.e. released), but that ANY proceeds
from
any sales be paid to:

Bank of America,
10 Light Street,
Baltimore,
MD 21202

Account name: Miles and Stockbridge P.C.

Account number: 00 200 382 2806 (Escrow).

We intend to challenge this condition immediately - hopefully Tuesday /
Wednesday (11th / 12th July).

Judge Garbis appears to be on our side, but since this was a 'Friday
afternoon'
judgement he has allowed Base Metals a little more time to try and prove we
were
involved in some 'fraud'.

The Judge told their lawyers that he could see NO indication of any such
evidence and that they had to 'put up or shut up'

Martin:
 Sorry I was unable to catch up with you on Monday; I tried your office and
"cell" phone, but called too late in the day.
 I think we should keep pushing here. I'm inclined to send Ely and company =
a
letter suggesting that they now have enough documentation to show them that
MG does, indeed, own the metal and that they should voluntarily release the
escrow arrangement. I would combine that with a representation that both MG
Corp and MG Ltd are quite solvent and more than able to cover a $5MM loss i=
n
the extremely unlikely event that Base Metals could ever prove to a court
that MG owed that amount to them. I would couple this with a request that w=
e
have an all parties conference call no later than Wednesday to discuss our
respective positions. If we can not achieve a result satisfactory to us,
then I feel we should go back to the court, probably no earlier than Monday
so as not to make it look to Judge Garbis that we are being excessively
aggressive.
 Our easiest argument to the court at this early stage is probably one base=
d
on our solvency, i.e., "Judge there is no need for you to escrow MG's money=
,
because MG is by no means a credit risk by any definition."
 The only other document relating to the metal that I would like to have is
evidence that Aluminum of Siberia did pay Unimetal for the metal in
question. Could you lay hands on that?

Mark,

Thanks your e-mail and proposed 'draft letter' to Egorov,Pirginsky and
Afanasiev.

We are in agreement to all your suggestions, but would ask your views on th=
e
following:

1) Do you think it would be advisable to return to the court say on this
Thursday, 13th July, and ask Judge Garbis what he considers 'reasonable tim=
e'
for the Plaintiff to react ???

2) We are all determined to keep the pressure on Base and must ensure we ke=
ep
them on the back foot - whilst we agree with the content of your draft we f=
eel
it could be harder hitting - lets discuss.

3) In regard to proof of payment by ALS to Unimetal we have the following
situation - ALS can show they made a number of large payments to Unimetal a=
nd
can supply a spreadsheet showing details of their account with Unimetal. It=
=20
may
be harder to show specific payments against specific invoices, but I am=20
pushing
ALS for such evidence.

4) In your draft letter plse note MG Metal is part of MG plc, a publically
traded company with a market cap of $450.00 million.

Lets discuss on your opening

 Dear Arthur and Martin:
 I received late this evening a rather outrageous letter from Ely Goldin in
which he takes the position that our documents "raise more questions than
they answer." He also indicates that he sees no purpose in having a
conference call unless it is to discuss our responses to his discovery
requests served upon us earlier today, which, incidentally, are completely
void and of no effect under the US Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in my
considered judgement.
 I will separately attempt to email to you Goldin's letter, but, in the
event technology fails me, will also fax it to you first thing Friday
morning.
 I believe we should go forward with the conference call among ourselves to
agree upon the next actions on our part. As we suspected, the Base Metal
people are plainly going to be anything but reasonable and, unfortunately,
we will almost certainly be forced to seek our relief from the Court, rathe=
r
than through business like discussions with them.
 I believe you already have dial in instructions for the 10:30 am EDT
conference call. If not, let me know and I'll get them to you.
 I look forward to speaking to you in the am.

Arthur and Martin:
     We've taken a quick look at the papers in the South Carolina case.
It turns out that Base Metal dismissed in that case because they had seized
the wrong metal. As they told the Court: "Upon seizure of the cargo by the
Marshal's service, inspection of the seized cargo and associated transfer
documents, Plaintiff is satisfied that the cargo seized was fabricated at
the Krasnoyarsk Plant, which is not Defendant's plant".

Fyi.  Talked to Pete a few minutes ago.  We filed a warranty claim with 
Westinghouse.  We will be running all units tomorrow, and we'll have a 
Westinghouse engineer there to work on the problem.  Pete has since called 
all the people below back to explain what we are doing to verify whether

Well, it continues. We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations 
resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each 
individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to 
listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little 
frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been 
unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings 
visiting their residence.

Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the 
closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I 
was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points 
feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this 
residence.

Mr & Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit 
their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.

Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her 
and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but 
while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations 
occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.

Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of 
trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the 
trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not 
determine if Vibrations were present or not.

Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all 
other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his 
dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his 
residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience 
some noise and vibration.

In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just 
temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we 
can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to 
be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the 
exhaust transition that they need to investigate. 

I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this 
problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying 
to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if 
this is possible.

We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, 
Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.

Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats 
why I want to get everyone out here if possible.

I spoke w/ Steve Hamilton (Pres/CEO) about co-signing the letter and although 
he agrees with the content, etc... he's a bit reluctant.  His concern is that 
if JB somehow pulls together the money to take us out, he will be 
ostracized.  What are your thoughts?  Is it still ok for me to send it as a 
member of and on behalf of the BOD?

I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has 
been filed. I am fairly certain there is no new filing. However, the  
Plaintiff's  discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin

Richard, Bonnie White advises me that you are handling this matter with 
outside counsel.  As you are aware, the underwriters denied coverage on this 
matter back in December 1999.  They have now inquired if any Amended 
Complaint has been filed that names a Director and/or Officer of Enron and if 
no Enron or an Enron subsidiary securities are involved.  If nothing has 
changed, they will go on and close their file.  Please advise if there is 
anything new to report.

Attached is a schedule detailing the gain/loss calculation for Ice Drilling.  
Apparently PriceWaterhouseCoopers acted as a receiver and sold Ice Drilling 
in August 99.  We received total cash proceeds of $9,583,845.74 between 
August and September, but the value of the asset on the books was 
$9,979,591.85 (loss of $395,746.11).  We also wrote off a receivable of 
$474,557.83.  In summary, we lost a total of $870,303.94 ($395,746.11 + 
$474,557.83).  I am assuming that we are trying to recover the total amount 
lost of $870,303.94.  Let me know if you need further information.

I received a telephone call from Schultes' attorney requesting that we make 
Barth, McConville, and the two analysts who went to Thailand available for 
depositions. Schultes' atty's names are Bill Redmond 440-893-0338 and Joel 
Levin 216-928-0600. They have a discovery deadline in Oct. I tried to talk 
them out of it but they insisted. I instead suggested a telephone interview 
with limited depositions to follow. Please call me Tues about this.

I have called you several times this morning but your phone rolls over to a 
messaging system that won't let me leave a message. That's ok today because I 
need to talk to you live, but it is good to know that I can't get ahold of

In a development agreement for a power plant in Connecticut, I have included 
what I believe to be our standard ENA arbitration/damages limitation 
provision, that contains a provision stating that ENA and counterparty shall 
each designate an arbitrator, " who need not be neutral", within 30 days 
after receiving notification of the filing for the demand for arbitration. 
The originators on the transaction are adamantly opposed to the quoted 
language because it is "not standard" ENA arbitration language, is an affront 
to our counterparty, and "could screw up the transaction" if I insist leaving 
it in the document. I have pointed out it is applicable to our and our 
counterparty's designee, and is intended to ensure we get at least one 
sympathetic or at least knowledgeable participant on the panel that could be 
persuasive to the panel as a whole. I also said I thought the deletion of the 
quoted language would give the counterparty the right to challenge a 
"non-neutral" designee under the rules of the AAA and throw the whole 
designation process up in the air ( I'm not sure that is right). Given the 
strident objections, do you think we materially prejudice our rights by 
removal of the quoted language, and if so, can you give me some greater 
ammunition to use with my originators? Thanks for your assistance.

Attached is the weekly ENA Litigation Status Report.

	Peter Keohane

Got your voice mail.  My thoughts are the following:

1.  I always insist that there is a breakdown of accounts by lawyer name, 
hourly rate and task description.  If it is not in this account I do not know 
why and I think it is appropriate that you ask for it and receive it.

2.  I would have expected the account to be large and that there are a number 
of people involved.  I lost involvement (at the direction of Delainey and 
Milnthorp) early in this project after the initial crisis management stage, 
but my observations of the number of people and resources involved are the 
following:  

At the outset we needed a number of people to manage the search and related 
technical and legal issues in the short term.  Over the longer term, staffing 
requirements ought to be greatly reduced and it seems that since the original 
crisis management stage the file has been over staffed.  At the same time, in 
fairness, I believe Blakes feels that the are responding to the requirements 
of Enron to throw al ot of resources at the project.  If it has not already 
happened, I believe you should speak to Dan Fournier to confirm our 
expectations and to discuss rationalizing resources.  As I say, I was asked 
to step back from this project, but I am happy to have this discussion with 
Dan Fournier if you prefer.

Also, I did not receive a copy of the account, but it seems to me that at our 
direction Blakes hired a number of economic and political consultants which 
will also be greatly expensive and which will as I understand be billed to 
Blakes and included in Blakes accounts as disbursements to maintain 
privilege.  If it has not already happened, I also believe the use of the 
consultants also needs to be rationalized.

I also expect that VE will have a not insignificant account.

In summary, since the initial stage I have had limited involvement, but I am 
not surprised (and would have expected) that the account is large and I 
expect that larger accounts are coming once consultant accounts start to roll 
in.  I believe that detailed account breakdowns are appropriate but also that 
the use of all consultants including Blakes needs to be rationalized.  I also 
believe that Blakes has done an excellent job and that a lot was be asked of 
them in the early stages and therefore they were throwing a lot of resources 
to the project.

Lastly, in anticipation that this would be expensive and that there would be 
a number of people involved, Rob Milnthorp initially spoke to John Lavorato 
about setting up a separate Houston RC for the project which John agreed to.  
The RC number I gave you may have been a Canadian RC and I need to confirm 
with accounting.  In any event, I will be sending a subsequent e-mail to all 
internal groups to make sure that all expenses, internal and external, are 
billed to that separate RC.

Peter.

I've arranged for both Judge Lacey and Stu Alderoty (both from our Newark, NJ 
office) to join us for lunch on September 27th when you are in New York.  
I'll also see if Steve Levitsky, our antitrust litigator who has been working 
on the Infineum case, can attend as well.  Based on your planned arrival into 
LaGuardia around 12:15 p.m. or so, I'll assume a late lunch in the 1:00/1:15 
p.m. range.  I also have assumed that we will meet at our NYC office at 125 
W. 55th St. (just off of 6th Ave., between 6th and 7th Avenues)--19th Floor.  
If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me 
know.

On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I 
would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice 
mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late 
last week.  The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I 
described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill & Knowlton who, 
according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's 
press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is 
very well known in CA Democratic circles.  He has been assisting us in 
certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he 
has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks 
to facilitate anything for you in that respect.

I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.  I hope that all is 
well.

Best regards.

John

Richard,

You and I have spoken about the costs in this case previously.  Matt and I 
have asked our various attorneys/experts to bill us monthly from this point 
forward, in order to get a better handle on those costs.

Matt has offered to be the "billing contact" for all our attorneys/experts.  
I am also available to do the same thing, although I obviously would have to 
charge my time for it.  I do think that a central billing contact is a good 
idea.

Please let Matt and me know how you want to proceed with this.

and informed me that the $2.2 million HEOF committed to Cynet was in
escrow as of September 9, and not actually invested in cynet itself as
the escrow was pending the rescission financing.  The actual financing
closed in December of 1999.  It turned out that HEOF THEN (not before)
invested not only the $2.2 million that was in escrow as of the valuation
date but an additional $220,000.

I think the valuation implications are obvious.

I took the liberty of handling this directly with Greg; if you have any
other questions, please feel free to call him.

Richard,

Marcus told me that wanted to refer to you and me the above-referenced new MG 
Metals matter.  Briefly, ICTS of Athens, Alabama, one of MG Metals' shipping 
agents, has reportedly gone into bankruptcy, without paying about $80,000 
owed to various motor carriers (truckers) for transportation here in the U.S 
of MG Metal's aluminum.  No one has yet confirmed that ICTS has in fact gone 
into bankruptcy.  

MG Metals' offices in Canada and New York have begun receiving truckers' 
demand letters for these freight charges, some of which are from attorneys 
threatening suit.  These letters state that as consignee of the various 
cargoes, MG Metals is primarily liable for payment of the freight charges.  I 
think that this is generally correct as a matter of U.S. law, given the usual 
motor carrier bills of lading, although I am having this double-checked.  

Since we have already paid most (but not all) of the money we owed to ICTS, 
MG Metals is looking at a double-payment exposure.  Also, even to the extent 
that ICTS has not been paid, it is entirely possible that ICTS overextended 
itself with a particular trucker and failed to charge MG Metals for enough to 
cover both ICTS's commission and the trucker's freight charges; in other 
words, a trucker may be looking for MG Metals to pay it more in freight than 
MG Metals originally agreed to pay ICTS (which amount should have covered 
both freight and commission).  

I believe that the largest single amount claimed by a trucker is $15,000.  
Bob Klide of MG's New York office and Nicole Dion of MG's Canada office (no 
relationship to Celine--I asked) will be shortly sending me their files.  

To complicate things a bit more, many of the letters Nicole has received deal 
with shipments made in March, at a time when Nicole and her office were 
employees of a trading division of Barclay's.  Some time afterward, they were 
acquired by MG Metals.  As a result of this, Barclay's may (depending on the 
agreement between Barclay's and MG Metals) be on the hook for some of this 
liability.  Nicole advises she has place a Barclay's representative on notice.

I would be happy to take this one off your plate if you would like.  
Obviously, it is a small dollar case and we don't want to pay any money to 
anyone unless we absolutely have to.  Let me know.

Britt

I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to respond to your inquiry. Her 
direct # is 713-853-6104.

Mr. Sanders:

We have received a telephone call from Kevin of Frontier Economics regarding 
outstanding invoices they currently have with respect to Project Stanley.

Kevin indicated that there are three invoices now issued and outstanding (the 
earliest dated back to July) and he is wondering when they might expect 
payment of the invoices.

Can you give me any idea as to when the accounts will be paid?  I believe 
Frontier Economics was looking for payment by direct wire if possible.

Thanks,

Richard:

I've arranged for both Judge Lacey and Stu Alderoty (both from our Newark, NJ 
office) to join us for lunch on September 27th when you are in New York.  
I'll also see if Steve Levitsky, our antitrust litigator who has been working 
on the Infineum case, can attend as well.  Based on your planned arrival into 
LaGuardia around 12:15 p.m. or so, I'll assume a late lunch in the 1:00/1:15 
p.m. range.  I also have assumed that we will meet at our NYC office at 125 
W. 55th St. (just off of 6th Ave., between 6th and 7th Avenues)--19th Floor.  
If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me 
know.

On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I 
would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice 
mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late 
last week.  The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I 
described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill & Knowlton who, 
according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's 
press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is 
very well known in CA Democratic circles.  He has been assisting us in 
certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he 
has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks 
to facilitate anything for you in that respect.

I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.  I hope that all is 
well.

Best regards.

John

Liz Austin, our  Connecticut counsel, has been asked to represent Arizona 
Public
Service Company and Griffin Energy Marketing, both of whom have recently been
sued by the PCA Trust.  As discussed below, we do not believe that there is 
any
adverse interest between Enron and these two companies, but Liz wanted you to 
be
comfortable with her concurrent representation of these two other defendants.
(As I may have mentioned before, many of the defendants in the joint defense
group are represented by one law firm.  There is a commonality of interest in
the defenses to the Trust's claims.)

The complaint against Arizona Public consists only of preference claims in the
amount of $300,000 and an objection to its $420,000 proof of claim.  Griffin
Energy has been sued for breach of contract, turnover, unjust enrichment,
fraudulent transfer, etc.  Total amount of claims equal $530,000.  With 
Griffin,
PCA failed to deliver power in May and the Griffin terminated its contract 
with
PCA before the energy spikes began to occur.

Liz has review the complaint against Enron and our draft answer and is aware 
of
our issues and defenses.  None of our defenses would be in conflict with the
defenses asserted by Arizona Power or Griffin.  If fact, many of the same
defenses would be raised.

Both Arizona Public and Griffin would agree that if any sort of issue conflict
came up in the future or if Enron became otherwise uncomfortable with the
concurrent representations, Liz would withdraw from representing Arizona Power
and Griffin and they will waive any right to assert a conflict or seek
disqualification.

Assuming that Arizona Public and Griffin Energy are not otherwise adverse to
Enron in other matters (which Liz did not believe they were), are you
comfortable with these concurrent representations?  I believe that there may 
be
some beneficial economies in the concurrent representations in that Liz's time
at hearings involving all defendants, etc. would be split among the 
defendants.
However, if you're uncomfortable, then that's the end of the analysis.

Liz is waiting to get back to Arizona Public and Griffin, so once you've
decided, please let me know.  Thanks.

Richard - -

This matter is riddled with insurance law and employment law issues.  If the 
independent contractor is deemed to be an employee under Wyoming law, then 
our insurance may come into play.  However, this has more significant 
implications under the employment arena.  A very valid argument exists if he 
is deemed to have been  an employee, then employment benefits may be due and 
owing.  I am somewhat familiar with these issues as I dealt with a similar 
issue for Enron Oil & Gas many years ago.

Who should I visit with regarding employment related issues?  Furthermore, if 
we have "independent contractors" driving their personal automobiles in 
discharging their duties, if they do not procure the correct insurance we 
will be facing this issue in the future. More specifically, when an 
individual places auto insurance they must tell the insurer that they are 
driving in their vehicle for business purposes, otherwise the insurer will 
deny coverage on these grounds. This is one of the issues that we are facing 
here.  

I await your response.

FERC Chief Asks Congress For Retroactive Rate Authority 
  
09/21/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman James 
Hoecker Thursday asked Congress to give the commission new authority to order 
refunds in the event of electricity price gouging. 
Hoecker sought the retroactive ratemaking authority in the context of the 
commission's investigation of power market volatility in California this 
summer, where prices for San Diego consumers have more than doubled from last 
year. 
Congress should give FERC "authority to retroactively correct extraordinary 
wealth transfers that can happen when prices unexpectedly skyrocket and 
consumers cannot get out of the way," Hoecker told the House Government 
Reform Committee. 
The commission, in response to a petition from San Diego Gas&Electric Co., a 
unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), has ordered a staff investigation of the market 
situation in California. 
FERC will order refunds if it determines that power producers have obtained 
"unjust or unreasonable" prices for the power they sold into California 
electricity markets overseen by the state's power exchange and independent 
system operator, Hoecker said. 
But under the Federal Power Act, FERC can't order any refunds beyond the Aug. 
23 date of its order setting the investigation, the nation's chief energy 
regulator noted. 
"We do not now have that authority," he said. 
"The commission staff is hard at work on completing its fact-finding 
investigation. Based on the staff report to the commission, we will be 
prepared to take further measures, as appropriate," Hoecker testified. 
"The commission expects its actions and the measures adopted by the state 
will moderate price volatility in California markets," he said.

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

suggestion of Richard Sanders, Grant Harvey of Gibbs & Bruns will be 
attending the meeting scheduled for Friday between ExxonMobil and Enron, 
given his representation of ENA in a suit with KN over the Bushton plant.  No 
decision as to outside counsel, however, has yet been made.  Bob Vote recalls 
hearing that Richard Sanders has advised Jim Derrick of this matter, and one

Tom Hatch asked me today why Enron did not just settle cheap with Farallon 
and Legg Mason and walk away from all these cases.? I told him we were 
considering it, but Enron did not want to encourage anyone else to sue Enron 
by showing a willingness to pay money just to get out of a lawsuit.? Tom 
replied that he thought that there was virtually no chance that anyone else 
would sue Enron now.? Since Hatch's clients have appeared to be the most 
likely prospects for still suing Enron, this was a very encouraging 
conversation.

Richard, have you heard from Mike Beatty (or Charlie Tetrault) on the results 
of his argument at the MDL Panel hearing that had been scheduled for last 
Friday?  I am assuming that I have gotten the date right and that it has not 
been rescheduled.

Thanks.

In order to resolve our warranty issues under the outstanding invoices with 
SWPC (both before and after our purchase), I request that Milbank Tweed be 
engaged for a limited review of the documentiation surrounding the issues 
(including warranty, consequential damage, incremental labor coverage).  
Milbank has a depth of project experience on project construction and 
equipment suppliers and their agreements.  I would propose the West Coast 
office and allow Ed Feo to select the appropriate personnel.

While I beleive that Milbank is not the only firm that can perform this 
engagement adequately, I do believe that they could be timely and cost 
efficient on a issue as largely commercial issue as this.  Please let me know 
your view as we need to resolve our options, and ultimately our course of 
action next week.

CONFIDENTIAL - - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

To all, other than Richard, please do not forward this e-mail on to others.

Richard -

As a follow-up to your request for information in support of any possible 
legal action at Gleason, I'm forwarding the attached news report.  I have 
copied only the three principle people (Eric, Ben, Mark) involved in 
analyzing the complaints, gathering information in support of your legal 
research, and responding accordingly.

A few comments:

1.  A third party analysis (Southwest Research Institute - - SWRI) showed no 
abnormal noise within the hearing range.
2.  SWRI showed that at 25 Hz there is a louder than expected vibration.  
This is well below the hearing range.  There are no vendor, regulatory, or 
otherwise, specifications for vibrations in this range.  The fleet of 501 
FD's is too small to get any historical data on this range.
3.  SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection 
system in the combustor.  We have informed the turbine vendor (Siemens 
Westinghouse - - SWPC) of this and asked that they work with us to resolve 
the following:
 a.  Is there a problem
 b.  If there is a problem, what can be done to completely correct the cause 
of it.
 c.  Barring (b), what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible 
problem (damping material in the stack, etc).
4.  Since we instrumented and tested (by SWRI), we have not had significant 
run time.
5.  Mark Dobler and I are meeting with SWPC in Orlando on Monday of next week 
to hammer out the detailed plan.
6.  The run season is coming to an end, and I expect fewer than 16 total run 
hours before next January.
7.  We are working to resolve whether there is a problem, and if so to 
correct it; however, since this is a new generation machine, any efforts have 
to be coordinated with the OEM (SWPC); therefore, an expeditious 

My instinct is to explain to the press and the neighbors fully what we are 
doing, but I want to make sure that we don't put ourselves in any legal 
jeopardy.  Advice? I suggest a meeting with all concerned if you have 
significant comments/advice.

Return to index of stories... 	DEEP IN THE HEART OF AFRICA, ONE OF THE THE 
MOST  INTELLIGENT ANIMALS ON EARTH FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL IN A REMOTE RAIN  
FOREST.
	THE ANIMAL IS THE BONOBO.
	SCIENTISTS HAVE THEIR OWN  NAME FOR THIS UNUSUAL PRIMATE."THE PEACEFUL CHIMP."
	LIZ  PURCELL TELLS US WHY THE NAME FITS IN THIS ENDANGERED SPECIES  REPORT.
	BONOBOS ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRIMATE THAT EXISTS ON  EARTH. PHYSICALLY,
	THEY STAND OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR GRACEFUL BUILD  AND ROUNDISH FACE. SOCIALLY
	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY'RE  VERY PEACEFUL.AND VERY
	SEXUAL.PRIMATES.
	"LIKE CHIMPANZEES  BONOBOS ARE OUR CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVE. THEY WERE  ONLY
	DISCOVERED IN THE 1920'S AND IDENTIFIED AS A SEPARATE  SPECIES FROM CHIMPS."
	WHILE CHIMPANZEES ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE  AND THEIR SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY
	MALES, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE OF  BONOBOS.
	"BONOBOS ARE EXTREMELY UNUSUAL BECAUSE FEMALES ARE  THE MOST TIGHTLY BONDED
	IN THE GROUP AND THEY USE THOSE BONDS TO  CO-OPERATE WITH EACH OTHER AND
	THEN DOMINATE MALES AND THIS IS  VERY RARE AMONG MAMMALS."
	BONOBOS REJECT VIOLENCE IN THEIR  COMMUNITY. THEY USE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO
	EASE TENSIONS AND SETTLE  DISPUTES. AMY PARISH MONITORS THE DAILY
	ACTIVITIES OF A GROUP OF  BONOBOS AT THE SAN DIEGO WILD ANIMAL PARK. THERE
	ARE FEW IN  CAPTIVITY ANYWHERE--AND THIS ONE OF THE LARGEST GROUPS IN  THE
	U-S.
	"AARON, KILI, COME HERE." 
	ANIMAL  KEEPERS AT THE PARK FIND THAT THE BONOBOS ARE SO QUICK AND  SO
	INTELLIGENT THAT WORKING WITH THEM IS A REAL  CHALLENGE.
	"THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE CREATURES. THEY'RE  CONSTANTLY PLAYING, MOVING,
	FORAGING FOR FOOD."
	BONOBOS  LIVE IN AN AFRICAN RAINFOREST IN THE CONGO BASIN LOCATED IN  THE
	COUNTRY FORMERLY KNOWN AS ZAIRE. THEY'RE ENDANGERED BECAUSE  THEIR FOREST
	IS BEING DESTROYED BY LOGGING COMPANIES. AND THEY'RE  HUNTED FOR FOOD. 
	FEWER THAN 20-THOUSAND OF THESE ANIMALS ARE  ALIVE IN AFRICA TODAY. THE
	BONOBOS, THEIR UNIQUE SOCIAL SYSTEM  AND THEIR HABITAT ARE UNDER ATTACK IN
	THE  WILD.

I am sending an e-mail about the power plant. I as told by an employee of
the plant they would let us know why the plant made so much noise and  so
much vibration. I have heard nothing but noise  and felt vibration. my wife
is scared because of the add in the news paper about how the plant could
explode if the person in charge of it made a mistake . I was not informed of
this plant being built. The newspaper said that the plant was being built in
a nonresadintal area there are 8 homes in this area alone. We should not
have to put up with the noise and vibrateing. Me and my family moved in the
country to avoid all the noise . Now that is all we here we can not enjoy
the outside like we use to and i am tired of it no one tell anything.
someone needs to tell us something .I thank you for your time.
                                        Thanks

>It's 8:20pm right now and it sound like there is a bad storm outside
or a disturbance that the law would be summons to and if this was a party
making that much noise there would be people in jail for it but good grief
that noise that the power plant makes would wake the dead and that is the
truth and yes i would like to get away from this but we dont like much
paying for our home but no one would dare buy it.

to help solve this problem and concern we have because i feel we are atleast
intitled to that.
I have lived here for 3 peaceful years and every one said how beautiful and
peaceful it was and now they are glad they dont live here and that is sad

Mark & Richard:  Since I have the benefit of reading the WSJ on my commute 
into the City, I thought I would just let you know if you had not see it 
already that there is a follow up article today to yesterday's article about 
the tremendous losses being absorbed by PG&E and SoCalEd due to the spike in 
wholesale power prices.  The article today, not surprisingly, talks about the 
significant 3Q earnings that are anticipated to be reported by the 
unregulated generating companies (E.g., Reliant, NRG and Southern) that 
purchased the plants from PG&E and SoCalEd.  While this "news" is not 
unexpected, it nonetheless is the type of article that tends to excite 
consumer advocates, politicians and regulators since it focuses on what it 
calls the "irony" of the utilities now suffering huge losses (which 
ultimately will be borne by consumers to some, and perhaps a large, extent) 
from having to buy power from assets they once owned.  Obviously, the concern 
is that the rhetoric overtakes a rational examination of the system.  I know 
that each of you are following this situation very closely, but I thought I 
would just drop you a quick note in any event.  John

Gentlemen:

As I mentioned in my earlier e-mail of this morning, I attach the latest 
versions of the letter to ExxonMobil and the chronology.  Again, I have 
deliberately softened the tone in the last paragraph of page 2 of the letter 
to wire around a potential problem caused by a 1995 letter from us to Mobil 
in the past about the role of ELSC.  We have also redrafted both the letter 
and chronology to reflect that the ELP, LP was a publicly traded company, so 
KN acquired only Enron's interest in it, not all of it.  We last redrafted 
the chronology to reflect that the partnership never actually owned the 
hydrocarbon recovery plant.

Mike has briefly reviewed these drafts and I understand has no problem with 
them (although I am resending them to him for him to review again if he 
wishes).  

Jim and Richard, once I have your respective comments/go ahead, I will send 
this to Eric Nichols by telefax this afternoon.  I will also give Nichols a 
heads-up that it is coming.

I await your response.

Britt

Eric, here is my response to the paragraph (in SGSI's letter concerning the 
money due for SGSI's work on the GeoQual web map project) which is underlined 
on page 3 and which takes the position that if we did not have a written 
Statement of Work in place, then SGSI owns all the work it did for us and we 
must cease use of it.  You and Laura might want to use this paragraph in your 
response to all his other business-related arguments.  (I might add, for the 
record and as a point for the future, that we can easily get into this kind 
of trouble when we don't take care to obtain signed Statements of Work before 
the work starts.)

Here it is:

Mr. Schlosser, your letter states that the ePower Locator, GeoQual, Hamachi, 
and Mountain Top applications are SGSI's intellectual property because the 
parties do not have an executed Statement of Work.  This argument is 
incorrect.  Both parties are bound by the fully executed professional 
services contract, which clearly states in Article 17 that all material 
developed by Consultant (SGSI) "shall become the property of Company (EBS) 
when prepared."  Because the work, whether or not covered in a written 
Statement of Work, was requested by EBS and performed by SGSI (subject to 
EBS' concerns about such performance),  the work is clearly covered by the 
Professional Services Contract, and the foregoing statement of ownership 
applies.  Accordingly, EBS respectfully refuses your requests concerning such 
work.

Eric and Laura, I would be happy to look at the balance of the letter, once 
you've written it.  You have my permission to go hard on these folks, if 
their work was poor and there was no EBS authorization for them to run up 
such high charges.

The policy is to delete all e-mails after 30 days, unless they are stored in 
a folder. E-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year. The policy 
has many benefits. First it clears up computer storage space.
The policy can  also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where 
a Judge has required the wholesale production of  e-mails. Imagine if we were 
required to sift through and digest 12-24 months of e-mail traffic. This has 
happened to a number of companies in litigation  the US( who have 
subsequently changed their retention policies). Frankly, the Microsoft  
antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy. In 
that case, the discovery by the Dept of Justice produced some very damaging 
e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine Bill Gates and 
others. It is unbelievable  what some people will put in an e-mail that they 
would never dream of putting in a "written"  document.
As for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails, I (and 
Bob) have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved. 
Please check with your source. I am happy to discuss any questions you have 
about the policy.

Please schedule ameeting w/ me, Randy Maffett, Roland Tellis at Milbank and 
Steve Hamilton at Ecogas(if Randy says we need him) to discuss the Waste 
Management case

Stuart -

Fyi.  Talked to Pete a few minutes ago.  We filed a warranty claim with 
Westinghouse.  We will be running all units tomorrow, and we'll have a 
Westinghouse engineer there to work on the problem.  Pete has since called 
all the people below back to explain what we are doing to verify whether 
there is a problem or not.

Well, it continues. We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations 
resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each 
individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to 
listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little 
frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been 
unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings 
visiting their residence.

Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the 
closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I 
was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points 
feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this 
residence.

Mr & Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit 
their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.

Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her 
and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but 
while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations 
occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.

Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of 
trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the 
trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not 
determine if Vibrations were present or not.

Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all 
other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his 
dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his 
residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience 
some noise and vibration.

In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just 
temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we 
can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to 
be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the 
exhaust transition that they need to investigate. 

I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this 
problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying 
to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if 
this is possible.

We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, 
Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.

Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats 
why I want to get everyone out here if possible.

Peter

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.

 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.

 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Richard, could you provide me with some information on where we are with the

on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in

I am sending an e-mail about the power plant. I as told by an employee of
the plant they would let us know why the plant made so much noise and  so
much vibration. I have heard nothing but noise  and felt vibration. my wife
is scared because of the add in the news paper about how the plant could
explode if the person in charge of it made a mistake . I was not informed of
this plant being built. The newspaper said that the plant was being built in
a nonresadintal area there are 8 homes in this area alone. We should not
have to put up with the noise and vibrateing. Me and my family moved in the
country to avoid all the noise . Now that is all we here we can not enjoy
the outside like we use to and i am tired of it no one tell anything.
someone needs to tell us something .I thank you for your time.

Looks good.  One comment:  Under the section "Generating Documents:  Requests 
12, 14 and 18,"  I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph 
starting with "For Portland General..." and not the "alternate ending."  To 
further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty 
extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has 
a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of 
increased wholesale purchases.  Paul Kaufman would have details of the 
request.

Hope your son's doing well.

("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of
the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

 Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy
Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the
burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars
of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
"family trees" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for
earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first
wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
"Transaction Documents") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which
information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings
regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell
generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,
do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to
produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.
We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other
information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a
significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that
time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort
will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on
the California wholesale market.

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the
Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.

 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of
the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

 Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy
Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the
burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars
of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
"family trees" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for
earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first
wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
"Transaction Documents") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which
information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings
regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell
generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,
do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to
produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.
We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other
information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a
significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that
time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort
will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on
the California wholesale market.

retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the
Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Pearson's June 9, 2000 letter questions why $.10 or $.11 were deducted from
the Transco and Koch indices in connection with the sale of Mobile Bay Block
870 gas.

We responded in detail on October 3.  In addition to those answers, we
should keep in mind that market value cannot necessarily be calculated with
mathematical precision.  Market value is often described in terms of a
range.  Indeed, the Inside FERC's Gas Market Reports publishes not only an
index price, but also a range of prices for each pipeline pricing point.

In looking at the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of the
sample months, it is clear that, if $.10 or $.11 were deducted from the
index price, then the resulting price would still be in the range as
published by Inside FERC.

For example, in December 1996, the Transco Zone 3 index price was $3.82.
The published range was $3.38 to $3.95.  So adjusting the index by 10 cents
still keeps you well within the range.

Similarly, for the 1996 Koch So. La. index.  The index price was $3.82.  The
range was $3.55 to $3.94.  Again, an 11 cent adjustment is still well within
the range.

A quick review of other months shows that sometimes the range was narrower,
and the adjustments would take you outside the range.  Nonetheless, we
should keep this background information in mind in case Justice continues to
pursue this point.

This is the new matter that we received a notice of default judgment in the 
amount of $23,579.17 against ECT on Friday, 10/06.  I spoke this morning with 
David Reed, an associate with Harter, Secrest & Emery LLP in Rochestor, New 
York, who is counsel for the Plan Administrator.  He said that he will speak 
with the partner in charge of this matter re whether they will voluntarily 
agree to lift default judgment, but he expects that they will so that neither 
side has to go through a hearing.  He will let me know sometime this week.  
This is apparently a bankruptcy preference action.  He said that he will send 
to me today copies of the complaint, as well as any proof of service 
documentation.  I will forward it to you when I get it.  We can then get 
accounting documentation to determine whether we have valid defenses to the 
preference action.  Let me know if you'd like me to handle this, or if you 
want it handled in some other manner.  I don't anticipate that this will 
require a lot of time to evaluate and answer.  Thanks.

I went to the Courthouse today for the Vinmar hearing on the motion to compel 
and for sanctions related to the traders tapes.  Before the start of the 
hearing, we met outside the courtroom with Vinmar's lawyers.  They apparently 
finally came to the conclusion that the arbitration agreement covers this 
discovery dispute, and, after some discussion, they agreed to pass the 
hearing.  We will work with them to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator 
this week, if possible, and they can have this issue heard before the 
arbitrator.  This morning they mentioned three former judges as potential 
arbitrators: Ruby Sondock, Alvin Zimmerman, and Susan Soussan, although I 
think their preference out of those three would be Alvin Zimmerman.  He would 
also be my preference out of those choices.  They may send us other names 
that they would consider using as an arbitrator, but, in the meantime, let me 
know what you think about these three.  Thanks.

This bankruptcy is apparently ours per CSC in Dublin.  We never reveived a 
complaint here, and CSC did not receive one.  I am having the A/R pulled to 
see if we have defenses; I will send you that info.  MDS

Bonnie White@ENRON
10/09/2000 04:55 PM
On Friday, 10/06/00, we received through our service of process procedures, a 
certified mail envelope advising us of a default judgment in the amount of 
approximately $23,000 ($20,825.43 is the principal amount of the alleged 
preference payments, plus interest) against ECT in an adversary proceeding in 
the above-referenced consolidated bankruptcies.  The bankruptcies were filed 
in 1998 in the Western District of New York (Rochester).  We had not received 
any prior pleadings in the bankruptcy or the adversary.  I am trying to 
determine if this relates to ECT/ENA accounts or to EES accounts.  Please 
advise whether EES has/had any accounts with these entities and/or whether 
EES filed a claim in the bankruptcies.  I have spoken with counsel for the 
Plan Administrator who filed the adversary proceeding.  They apparently sent 
service of the adversary to ECT by certified mail addressed to our PO Box 
1188, Houston address.  It never made it up to us.  In any event, I would 
like to determine as quickly as possible whose account it is and whether we 
have any defenses to the preference allegations.  Plan administrator's 
counsel has told me that he will hold off on executing on the judgment for 
10-14 days to hear further from us.  If we can explain why we didn't receive 
service (I think our response is: you didn't serve our registered agent) and 
we can show defenses to the adversary, they will likely voluntarily set aside 
the default.  In any event, we need to determine this as soon as possible in 
case we need to file a motion to set aside the default judgment.  Thanks.

I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to get you this information.

I just spoke with Mike Day.  He received a call back from Harvey Morris at
the CPUC.  They have not yet had a chance to read our response and cannot
convene the group that needs to look at it until tomorrow.  (Mike reads that
as they are giving it to a consultant for comment.)  We have a scheduled
conference call with Harvey for 10:00 a.m. PDST on Friday.  I will call in
from Mexico.  Peter will set up an 800 number and call in ID.  Once Mike,
Peter and I are on the phone, we will conference in Harvey.

With respect to the production of documents, I told Mike that the documents
were being shipped here and we would process them on Friday.  We will
address delivery on the 10:00 conference call.

As an aside, Harvey apparently said that a number of other companies had
decided to cooperate after being threatened by the CPUC staff.

Max-- I asked Bonnie White to assist me on this matter because I have been 
swallowed up on another project. Bonnie is with the Enron Litigation Unit and 
spends most of her time on ENA litigation issues. I know what is happening 
and I am still very much involved. If a lawsuit  is filed Ileana Blanco at 
Bracewell will be our trial atty. Her role is small at this stage.

As I indicated in my voice mail message to you, Bonnie White is an Enron 
inhouse litigator who is handling the McKenna matter and Ileana Blanco is a 
Bracewell Patterson attorney whom Bonnie has retained to represent Enron in 
the McKenna matter.

They are trying to learn more about the history of the McKenna project to be 
able to distinguish it as clearly as possible from the Vitro project in an 
effort to prevent the filing of litigation by McKenna.

If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public
Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").

 The Enron Entities produce these documents pursuant to our email
exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission
agrees that by producing these documents, the Enron Entities have not waived
any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any
claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses
have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if
necessary.

 In addition, the Enron Entities produce these documents with the
understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order
than the one currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document
productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In
addition, if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding,
the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests
for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve
the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such
order.

FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the 
street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the 
"misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney 
thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of 
California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain 
child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also 
set up the Governing Boards.

Sorry Bob--too late, this case belongs to you. Seriously, I have asked Britt 
Davis to help me sort this out. He has been heading up the effort to 
(finally) get rid of this case

As most of you know, Enron had some discussions with Euell Energy regarding 
SPR oil.  We ultimately were unable to do any deal with Mr. Euell and 
subsequently, he publicly blamed us for his inability to complete a deal.  
Attached is an article from the Wall Street Journal.  Mark Palmer, Steve Kean 
and I spent most of Friday trying to kill the story.  In addition to numerous 
conversations, we even played tapes of the final three phone calls between 
Mr. Euell and our trader.  While we were unable to kill the story completely, 
we are pleased with the outcome.  If you have any questions, please call me 
at ext. 3-9053.

A Trio of Little Guys
Embarks on Wild Ride
In Global Oil Market
---
Pursuing Business With DOE,
Their Paths Diverge; One
Leads to `a Lot of Money' 
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John Fialka in Denver, Alexei 
Barrionuevo in Tallahassee, Fla., and Jonathan Weil in New York 
? 
10/16/2000 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A1 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Lance Stroud of New York, Renard D. Euell of Denver and Ronald Peek of 
Tallahassee, Fla., all had dreams of becoming oil barons. And on Oct. 4, when 
the Department of Energy announced the results of the bidding for oil from 
the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they thought their ships had come 
in. 
Two of the three black entrepreneurs were unknowns in the industry, and none 
of them had ever done a major oil deal. But there they were, listed as 
winning bidders alongside some of the biggest names in the business -- 
Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., BP Amoco 
PLC and Amerada Hess Corp. Each would be given the right to withdraw millions 
of barrels of oil from the reserve amid one of the most volatile oil markets 
in decades. In exchange, each had offered to replace that oil, plus an 
additional amount akin to an interest payment, a year later. They and the 
other winning bidders, the Energy Department said, were picked soley because 
they pledged to return the biggest quantities of oil to the reserve. 
There was just one catch: In its rush to release the oil and so ease a price 
crunch, the Energy Department had suspended its usual requirement that each 
bidder supply financial guarantees. But it wanted the winning bidders to 
present letters of credit, equal to the oil's market value, five days after 
their bids were submitted. The big players could easily meet that 
requirement. But Messrs. Stroud, Euell and Peek were men of limited means. 
They needed to find someone willing to back them for tens of millions of 
dollars -- and fast. 
The drama made for an unaccustomed scene in Harlem, where the 35-year-old Mr. 
Stroud lived with his 74-year-old mother. A heavy-set man with a goatee, Mr. 
Stroud, a former Army enlisted man who had dropped out of college shy of 
graduation, had held a string of odd jobs while using the Internet to seek 
out a big business deal. 
The aspiring oil man had entered his bid for four million barrels from the 
reserve, via the Internet. He won't discuss the details of his bid, but says 
he thought he could outbid the large oil companies because he didn't have as 
much overhead. After the winning bids were announced, Mr. Stroud became 
something of a celebrity. TV news crews arrived to interview his neighbors, 
many of whom had no idea what all the fuss was about. "I thought he [Mr. 
Stroud] was some kind of rap star," recalls Carline Thomas, who lives down 
the hall from him. 
As neighbors paused to shoot the breeze on the steps of nearby residential 
buildings, most marred by graffiti, Wall Street couriers bearing fat packets 
of information spent the week scurrying back and forth from Mr. Stroud's 
apartment on a seedy block in Harlem's central business district. 
Inside Mr. Stroud's apartment, the telephone wouldn't stop ringing, and his 
mother was helping him field the calls. He says he was in serious talks with 
four companies. And a movie producer was interested in his life story. Then, 
amid the chaos, tragedy struck. On Tuesday night, his mother, Iris Manning, 
suffered a cardiac arrest, and was taken to a hospital a few blocks south of 
Mr. Stroud's apartment. 
Mr. Stroud said he spent most of Wednesday running between his apartment and 
the hospital, taking occasional phone calls to deal with prospective 
financiers. Ms. Manning went into cardiac arrest three more times, and died 
at 9:47 p.m. Wednesday evening. 
Mr. Stroud was dazed by the fact that what he called the two biggest events 
of his life -- the death of his mother and his selection by the Energy 
Department -- occurred almost simultaneously. "I'm saying `there must be some 
reason I'm here,' " he said later. "These things happening like this, the 
odds must be in the millions." 
Mr. Stroud won't discuss which companies were vying for his oil, but he says 
at one point he thought he had an offer to buy him out for $1.50 a barrel, or 
$6 million. The most serious discussions began Thursday, with a 
representative from a refining company, which he refuses to name. From that 
discussion Thursday until the following evening, Mr. Stroud says, he was 
confident that the refiner would grant him the letter of credit he needed. 
But at 9 p.m. Friday, three hours before his deadline, Mr. Stroud said he got 
a call telling him the deal was off. "I was upset," he says. "I mean, instead 
of wasting my time with that I could have obtained the financing quickly" 
from some other source. 
A spokesman for Koch Industries Inc., based in Wichita, Kan., said it was in 
negotiations with both Messrs. Euell and Stroud. "We invited them to make a 
deal that made economic sense." BP Amoco said it also had discussions with 
Mr. Stroud. 
Mr. Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension, under the 
circumstances. "If your mother passes, aren't you given three days to 
grieve?" Mr. Stroud asks. His mother's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday, 
which would have been her 75th birthday, he says. 
Mr. Euell ran a small company, Euell Energy Resources, whose 12 employees 
helped him broker natural-gas sales and other small energy deals. By night, 
he worked the phones from his home in a modest Denver suburb, calling oil 
producers in Nigeria and energy brokers in Singapore and Sydney, always 
looking for the big score that would make him rich. 
A friend, Norman Early, a sometime golfing partner and a former Denver U.S. 
district attorney, says the 50-year-old Mr. Euell is "one of those guys who 
shoots for the stars." On Oct. 4, Mr. Euell thought he had hit one. He had 
been awarded the right to withdraw three million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in exchange for returning 3.3 million barrels a 
year later. That was enough oil to fill 14,019 conventional tank trucks. 
Knowing he would need a partner to provide financial backing, Mr. Euell had 
already placed a call to a man he'd never met: Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and 
chief executive of Enron Corp. He said he was sure he was going to be one of 
the top bidders for the reserve oil. Would Enron like to be his partner? 
Within a few hours John Nolan, the giant energy company's vice president in 
charge of trading, called from London. Enron , he said, was interested. 
By Oct. 6, the price of oil had already fallen, making Mr. Euell's bid look 
generous. Still, he felt bullish. "I'm betting on Mother Nature, that she's 
coming back this winter and that oil's going to be more valuable." 
It wasn't Mother Nature, but the crisis in the Middle East that turned things 
around. Monday, Oct. 9, the target price for November oil futures on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, jumped a dollar to $31.86 a barrel and headed 
higher. Mr. Euell flew to Houston and took a room at the Hyatt Regency, from 
which he could see Enron 's 50-story office tower. 
By Tuesday, the price of oil had hit $33.18. By Mr. Euell's calculations that 
meant a $3 million profit for him and an equal amount for his prospective 
partner just across the street. Enron 's lawyers were working on an agreement 
that would substitute Enron as the major party in Mr. Euell's contract, he 
said, and were drawing up the letter of credit for $93 million that the DOE 
required. 
Eager to close the deal, Mr. Euell called Enron trader Patrick Danaher, who 
was working on the project. "I want to sign this thing up today," Mr. Euell 
told him, claiming that he had received an offer from another, unnamed firm, 
offering to buy his contract for $1.2 million. According to tapes of the 
conversation provided by Enron , Mr. Danaher said the paperwork was under 
way: "Let me see if we can do that today." 
Mr. Euell called backed at 11:30 a.m. and again at 11:45 a.m. Each time, the 
trader sounded more pessimistic. Prospects were "50-50." When Mr. Euell 
suggested he had other offers, Mr. Danaher told him: "If you have a bid at 
$1.2 million, you should take it. A bird in the hand is worth two in the 
bush. I just have to tell you that." Still, he invited Mr. Euell to dinner. 
Tuesday's deadline passed without dinner or any action from Enron . While it 
appears from the tapes that the parties had been close to an accord, Eric 
Thode, a spokesman for Enron 's trading branch, says: "At no time was there 
anything remotely resembling a deal with Mr. Euell." 
Mr. Euell got the DOE to agree to extend the deadline for another 24 hours 
and, after a round of frantic phone calls, says he collected pledges from a 
group of European banks to support the $93 million letter of credit. But, 
when the new deadline expired, he still had failed to get the proper 
paperwork to the DOE, which then declared his award to have lapsed. "They 
played me," Mr. Euell complains, blaming Enron for the missed deadlines. 
Still, he says, the experience amounted to an instant "Ph.D." in oil. Next 
time, he vows, he will have his own letter of credit. 
The DOE said late last week that it will accept new bids on the seven million 
barrels of oil Messrs. Stroud and Euell forfeited. 
As for Mr. Peek, he remains the mystery man of the three. His company, 
Burhany Energy Industries Inc., was formed Aug. 21. It employs no one but Mr. 
Peek himself. Staffers at the Florida Black Business Investment Board, where 
Mr. Peek works as a business-development specialist, said he had taken last 
week off. Shutters were drawn at his modest, one-story house in Tallahassee. 
Phone calls to Mr. Peek were forwarded to an unidentified neighbor. In an 
e-mail to a reporter, Mr. Peek apologized for being unreachable. He was 
"working relentlessly to consummate this transaction" and couldn't "entertain 
any distraction at the moment." 
On Saturday, the Department of Energy announced that Mr. Peek had 
successfully transferred his interest in three million barrels of government 
oil to Hess Energy Trading Co. of New York, a partnership that includes 
Amerada Hess. Amerada Hess Vice President Carl Tursi said he could give few 
details of the deal, except to say that he believes there was an 
"arrangement" that resulted in "a lot of money" for Mr. Peek.

We have spoken to Alice Gruber, the immigration attorney.  In order for her
to determine if we can get this L-1 transferred, she will need a very basic
diagram of the transactions between these companies.  For example, who
acquired what and at what percentage as well as whether the transactions
were stock based, asset acquisition and/or mergers.

Please send directly to me and I'll work with Alice.

Alice:  with reference to the following, Enron recently made an asset
acquisition of Rudolf Wolf.  We have received the following note from
London:

"Need your help sorting Paul out.  Rudolf Wolf is an MG owned company.
Paul is a UK national, on an L-1 visa obtained by the Rudolf Wolf company.
He is transitioning shortly to an Enron contract, and I'm not sure what we
need to do from an immigration perspective to transition the L-1 visa.

Could you let me know what information the lawyers will need, so that I can
get the ball rolling."

Please let me know whether it is possible to bring Paul Fingster over on an
L1 given the fact that Enron did not do a stock transfer?

Many thanks

Sorry, I have been out on vacation.  Before I call Ingrid, I just wanted to
see if you found out anything on your trip to NY.  MG MCC should have
immigration attorneys who assist with their visa filings and should be able
to coach her.  I am nervous about coaching her as we have a law firm handle
all our visa issues.  Because each case may be different, we have the law
firm speak with each individual to determine the best route to take, then
they complete all the paperwork and we sign.

Hi, Jane!

I talked to Ingrid Krinke again today.  Ingrid is the HR person at MG MCC,
the New York branch of MG plc.  MG plc has acquired Rudolph Wolff, another
British company.  Rudolph wolfe has the two H1 and one L1 visa employees.
It turns out that MG plc is doing an asset acquisition of Rudolph Wolff,
not a stock transfer, and Ingrid's immigration attorney tells her that they
cannot transfer an L1 in an asset transfer.  Ingrid is starting the process
of transferring the H1's from RW to MG.  I do not know how much ingrid
knows about visas, and it would probably be good if we guided her so that
she does not so something that impacts us or that is unnecessary.

Ingrid has a thick file of immigration "stuff" on these folks but she does
not know what to send to us.  Could you give her a call and talk to her
about the situation?  I am concerned that i am not asking her the right
questions, or I may garble the info when I pass it on to you.  Ingrid is at
212.715.5241.  I told her that you might call.

closing is forecast for Sept. 8; i may be in NY either this monday or the
following monday collecting data.  I would be happy to sit with you and
tell you what I know , or join in on the call to ingrid.  Please ring me.

Thanks a bunch.

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 

	

TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

10/16/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

Gentlemen,

To the extent that you are aware, I would be grateful if you could let me 
know where we stand on the settlement of the claim with Interfert, which as I 
recall had been settled as to liability (but unresolved as to quantum).  We 
are unable to finalise the liquidation of Enron Gas Liquids Europe until this 
claim is settled.

Many Thanks.
Justin

The folks at East Coast Power inquired as to what is our document retention

written statement of the policy that I can send to them?

I told them that the 6 month rule is a general rule, and would, of course, be 
subject to exceptions for any statutory, regulatory or contractual obligation 
to keep certain docuemtns for longer periods.  I also suggested to them that 
all docuemntation necessary to prove up the QF status of the plants should be 
keep for a substantially longer period, at least for the relevant limitations 
periods.  Do you agree?

Enron's Third-Quarter Profit Rises 31 Percent as Sales Surge

     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said third-earnings rose 31 percent as
revenue more than doubled.
     Net income rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from
profit from operations of $223 million, or 27 cents, in the year-
earlier quarter. Enron was expected to earn 32 cents a share, the
average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. Revenue rose to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
     Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services
unit, which consists of marketing energy commodities and investing
in energy-related assets, more than doubled to $28.2 billion from
$11.1 billion. Revenue from its retail energy services business
almost tripled to $1.48 billion from $542 million.
     In the year-earlier quarter, a gain of $345 million, or
44 cents a share, and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents, made
net income $290 million, or 35 cents.
     Shares in the Houston-based company rose 50 cents to $80
yesterday. They've risen 80 percent this year.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 

	

TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement

Thanks for your e-mail about the Duke/Enron case. There is only one slight 
problem---we have no idea what case this is. Neal Manne at Susman represented 
us in a case against Duke that settled early last year. We have no active 
litigation  or disputes against Duke. My curiosity is pegged out. I asked Bob 
Boemer if he could find out more w/in ethical boundries.

FYI. Dow Jones had a story on our lawsuit.

HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, said on Tuesday its third-quarter 
earnings rose 31 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations as online 
trading helped drive strong growth at its wholesale energy operations. 
Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $223 
million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had 
expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial.
"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting 
levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability," said 
Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. 
"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, 
and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our 
company," Lay added. 
Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as 
broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues 
rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999. The 
company's stock has risen some 80 percent so far this year.

Arena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, 
pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. 
More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and 
civic-association members attended an informational meeting and 
get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was 
sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. 
"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it 
empowers us," said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports 
Authority director. "It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic 
community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position." 
George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team 
is actively courting the Hispanic community. 
The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, 
and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a 
repeat of the 1999 referendum. 
Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports 
authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and 
county to oversee and develop sports venues. 
The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one 
made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share 
the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. 
The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood 
improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit 
organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets 
the Hispanic community, Postolos said. 
The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, 
including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario 
Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. 
Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is 
getting more tangibles this time around. 
He said, "When you consider that our community will get 30 percent 
affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth 
outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this 
is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the 
Hispanic community." 
Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, 
heard the details of the plan for the first time. 
"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild 
the community," she said. "We want it to be good for the whole, not the few." 
Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, 
was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. 
"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay 
raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for 
rich entrepreneurs," Barrera said. 
Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told 
attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. 
Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the 
lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos 
acknowledged that the team needs to do better. 

	

TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 Mln
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in 
a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power 
marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales 
contract. 
TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its 
distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen 
expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its 
debt-reduction forecast. 
According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged 
breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 
2000. 
TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is 
under a court protective order. 
"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract," said 
David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on 
the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility 
customers. 
But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the 
subject of the claim. 
TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment 
order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, 
stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman 
said Monday. 
In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of 
contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. 
But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to 
elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA 
said Enron sought the court seal. 
The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based 
energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest 
U.S. power producers. 
The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to 
the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes 
during hot weather in the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
After the summer of 1998 - in which power that typically sells for between 
$30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - 
Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only 
unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. 
TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were 
spiking upward. 
Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on 
the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access 
across TVA's system. 
After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron 
began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by 
failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service 
requests. 
A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement 
over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. 
But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public 
with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. 
In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its 
own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's 
requests were gathering dust. 
Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its 
transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

I have attached a draft of the demand letter to be sent to Kingdom Energy 
Company.  As you will note, there are two blanks:  (1) the amount of out of 
pocket expenses we are claiming; and (2) the signature line.

Please call me to discuss this information.

I think we are in favor of the idea depending on what we buy. Frankly, the 
kids don't need anything there. What the house really needs are pots and 
pans. What is the suggestion?

I don't know when we are coming---our lives are too hectic right now.

Give me a call when you get a second. I tried to call you today.

but on the Christmas E mail I sent to you...you were the only one that I did
not hear from.  John, Steve, and Doug all thought it was a good idea to
possibly do something for the Perd for the kids.  But I don't want to
continue on that way...if you and Julie were not into that.  So, please tell
me what yall are thinking.  I meant to ask her about it yesterday...but
forgot.

Also, I am trying to do a family homepage for our clan so that the scheduling
of the Perd....would be accessible by Website....so that it is not really
under any one's control.  With Steve moving here....I think that it will work
out better.

By the way, when do yall think you will be going next.  Anytime soon.  We
would love to see yall.

It has either been settled or abandoned, but I haven't heard anything about 
the dispute in weeks.

   

Richard,

Has the dispute with Duke Energy International been settled?

Thanks!

I asked Bob Williams and he stated that as long as the dispute has been 
settled then there is no need to keep documentation.  You might want to 
confirm this with Richard Sanders who worked with us on this issue.  
Regards,
Brent

Brent,

Sara asked me to e-mail you to see if we should purge all of the 
documentation in connection with the recent dispute?

Thanks!

I have attached a draft letter to Duke requesting Duke's assurance of 
performance under the LNG sales contract.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions; otherwise, the letter is ready to go.

Please let Linda know what is happening.

Project Stanley is a unique, sensitive project that is being handled within a 
limited circle within Houston and Calgary.  Nonetheless, the project is being 
handled out of Houston and is incurring significant expenses, only some of 
which are legal expenses.

A separate RC was requested to be set-up under the commercial direction of 
John Lavorato and Rob Milnthorp.  The other principal contacts are from Legal 
- Mark Haedicke, and Government Affairs - Rick Shapiro.  Frankly, I (as well 
as Rob Milnthorp and Enron Canada generally) only have limited involvement in 
this project.

Peter,

Cheryl (from accounting) spoke to me this morning - she said that they are 
having no luck with their contacts in Houston (Accounting) with respect to 
setting up a Houston RC for Project Stanley - no one seems to know anything 
about it.

Cheryl was wondering if we have a contact in Houston - Legal that she could 
speak to about getting this set up with Houston - Accounting.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Linda

I closed the Charles Schwab account that contained the Pedernales money

October 18, 2000=20

A power company executive yesterday boiled California's ongoing electricity=
=20
crisis down to the bottom line.=20

"Prices are rising, and I know that's hurting consumers =01) but it certain=
ly=20
has been beneficial for Enron," said Jeffrey Skilling,=20
president and chief operating officer of the Houston-based energy and tradi=
ng=20
company.  Enron declined to specify how=20
much it earned from California during the past summer, when the state's=20
deregulated electricity market sent power prices=20
soaring. But the Texas company did say that profits of its sales and servic=
es=20
unit =01) which trades California electricity and o
ther commodities =01) increased 135 percent to $404 million.=20

Dynegy Inc., also based in Houston, reported that income from its marketing=
=20
and trade unit soared more than 300 percent to $142 million.   Steve
Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, said California was perhaps only the=20
third-biggest contributor to that surge. But industry analysts said the=20
earnings
 reports are the first indication of a pattern expected in coming weeks.=20

"California clearly drove the positive momentum at both of these companies,=
"=20
said Carol Coale, senior analyst of Prudential=20
Securities. "And you probably just saw the beginning of a string of strong=
=20
reports (from the power industry)."  She and others=20
say they suspect that power companies derived billions in profits from the=
=20
state, where tight supplies set the stage for huge price increases.=20

Companies did not necessarily have to own generating plants to profit from=
=20
the deregulated market. Enron produces no electricity in California=20
but is the nation's largest electricity trader, buying and selling the outp=
ut=20
of power plants owned by other companies.=20

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, said the big profits should be seen in=20
something other than a business context.  "These massive profits=20
by the energy companies translate directly into thousands of San Diegans=20
losing savings that were planned for education, mortgage=20
payments, health care and other . . . necessities," Hunter said.=20

When the state power exchange saw dramatic price increases within a matter =
of=20
hours, "it was clear that predatory pricing was producing=20
massive profits for someone," Hunter said.  Hunter insists that recent powe=
r=20
prices violate federal law mandating that rates be "just and reasonable."=
=20
He is calling for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order refunds=
.=20
FERC is scheduled to issue a report on the California market by Nov. 1.=20

The political fallout from the price increases, meanwhile, appears to weigh=
=20
heavily on power companies, which are reluctant to tout successes in=20
California for fear of being singled out for profiteering.=20

After noting that Dynegy's recent acquisitions in Illinois contributed=20
strongly to the company's success last quarter, Bergstrom was reminded that=
=20
he=20
had omitted mention of California.=20

"Illinois is not as politically volatile as California," Bergstrom said.=20

He acknowledged that Dynegy did "pretty well" in California because its pow=
er=20
plants produced far more electricity this year than last. Bergstrom=20
also sought to correct an earlier report that Dynegy had quickly recouped t=
he=20
cost of power plants it recently acquired in the state.=20

He said that was true only of the plants it owns in Long Beach and El=20
Segundo, which it bought in 1998. Bergstrom said the cost of Dynegy's half=
=20
interest=20
in the former San Diego Gas & Electric Encina power plant in Carlsbad =01)=
=20
acquired at the end of 1998 =01) had not been recovered.=20

Typically, plant operators assume that it will take as long as 20 years to=
=20
recoup such costs.=20

In comments to financial analysts, Skilling, of Enron, suggested that power=
=20
companies could help provide a solution to California's power problems.=20

"Supply constraints and the resulting price pressures in California and oth=
er=20
locations have demonstrated the need for skilled marketers like Enron=20
to provide reliable power and stable prices," Skilling said.  He predicted=
=20
that California's utility companies =01) which now buy much of their power =
from=20
other companies =01) would sign long-term contracts to stabilize prices,=20
following an approach suggested by many power generators and traders.=20

"If they were willing to extend the terms of their purchases to 10-year=20
contracts, then they could get contracts for $50 a megawatt, which is not=
=20
much=20
different than they were paying two or three years ago," Skilling said.=20

But consumer advocates have noted that long-term contracts at those levels=
=20
would lock consumers into price increases and leave them with little=20
choice about suppliers. Advocates of electrical deregulation had predicted=
=20
that introducing competition would lead to reductions in power costs=20
and to greater consumer choice.=20

Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said he=
=20
was skeptical of solutions proposed by the power industry.=20

"Any proposal from the industry has to be suspect because they have engaged=
=20
in faking out the California public and price gouging when there=20
are shortages," said Snyder, who advocates an end to deregulation.=20

"They do not have consumer interests at heart."

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=

which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=
=20
impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.

 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=
=20
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=

Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=
e=20
to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance=

carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20
including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=
ne=20
Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20
insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=
he=20
District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits=
=20
seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and=
=20
property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years=
=20
without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not=
=20
to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =
or=20
trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the=
=20
explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The=
=20
defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous=
=20
suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal=
=20
court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=
n=20
believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric=20
Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20
generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario=
n=20
County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=
d=20
not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20
Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruli=
ng=20
was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1995 general rate order which=
=20
granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=
n=20
Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=
s=20
stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and =
the=20
OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined=
=20
with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=
 =20
On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=

OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=

its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20
authorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=
n.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=

I left Twanda several messages last week about trying to schedule a conference
call to start the settlement discussions in the PCA case.  I know that last
message was to her direct voice mail, but the earlier ones may have been to a
wrong number (number dialed:  713-853-9042).  Sorry if they didn't get through
to her.

Nonetheless, the Trustee and counsel are available for a conference call on
Thursday, Oct. 26th in the morning after 10:30 CST and up until 2:00 pm.  Do 
you
have any time on Thursday.  I know it is late notice, but if you do, then I'd

I am available on Wednesday to sit down and review the issues, numbers, etc. 
in
preparation of such a call.  If we go forward on Thursday, let me know what
works for you on Wednesday.  Thanks.

I'm in the office Monday morning, but will be traveling on Monday afternoon

ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard and Elizabeth:  
While I was away on vacation, Steve Hall included this statement in a status 
report to me;  

" >While you were gone I learned a new one from Smith Day, which involves 
submitting bids for less than one MW, i.e., .0005 MW.  Because of a glitch in 
the ISO's rounding system, the MW get rounded down, but the payment gets 
rounded up.  Playing this game is worth about $9000/day. "

9,000 X 365 = 3,250,000.

Let's discuss.  ----cgy

Can you attend the meeting and the conference call?
	melanie.gray@weil.com
	10/23/2000 10:23 AM
		 
Thanks for getting back to me.  Twanda also left a message this morning.

I am available at 3:00 on Wednesday, so consider that booked.  I'll come over 
to
your offices.  I have called the Trustee's counsel to propose times on 
Thursday
morning.  Hopefully we can start around 10:30 am, and I would be surprised if
this first conversation went more than an hour to an hour and one-half.  Of
course, I am planning on coming to your offices for the call on Thursday, but 
if
a lunch in the "restuarant rich" area of downtown holds any appeal, please
consider coming down here and we'll go to lunch afterwards.

I think it may be helpful if Elizabeth Sager is available on Wednesday to go
over the how Enron calculated the Termination Payment (I know the payment was
zero, but the amount of "Gains" to Enron under the Master Agreement may have
some bearing in connection with their unjust enrichment claims) and her
calculation of Enron's gain from selling the power otherwise deliverable to 
PCA
in the market after the Master Agreement was terminated.  Elizabeth has
recalculated the proper amount of EPMI's proof of claim, and it appears that 
the
original proof of claim was overstated a bit.

You may have all this information -- but if not, Elizabeth does and we should
get our arms around it.

I'm going to be messengering to you today the Trust's mediation statement 
filed
in connection with the other defendants.  I only have a fax, and if I fax it 
to
you, you won't be able to read it.  It would be beneficial for you to review
this statement as it sets forth the Trustee's position in more detail.    It
provides the basis for their claim of unjust enrichment, even though I 
continue
to believe that unjust enrichment is not available in connection with the 
Master
Agreement and EPMI's termination for unpaid invoices.

I also think it would be helpful to connect Liz Austin into our conversation 
on
Wednesday so that she can advise you of her experience in mediating with the
Trustee.  She has represented at least one other defendant who mediated with 
the
Trust successfully.  Her insights of what to expect will be helpful.

Thanks.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks
Gary

 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks
Gary

In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to 
us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised 
by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put 
option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would 
never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this 
filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the 
fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the 
options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our 
ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of 
thing,ie. is this some kind of "illegality" issue?  I am working on the 
second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, 
I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy

Status Report re: tape transcripts

At this time, this summary has been sent to you only.

Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with 
us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in 
exchange for our providing similar information to them.

He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, 
the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex 
equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own 
equipment.

As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover 
the period of September of 1999 to the end of October.

The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover 
the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999.

With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim 
of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has 
asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question.  
We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in 
time, they have not responded to us.

If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend 
to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this 
particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear.

Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not 
particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the 
flavour of the matter to our benefit.

On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see 
exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will 
advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our 
offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see 
exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between 
Powerex and Enron.

We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience.

group.  Thank you.

Dear Mr. Williams,
?
This is a follow-up to?the October 5 meeting on the AAA's  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? One of the most exciting aspects of  that meeting was 
the enthusiasm for the systems and services we are developing  to support the 
Protocol.? We are now at the stage in which we need to get  direct feedback 
from potential users, and I am putting together a working group  to look at 
several aspects of our efforts, including:
?
??? - The mechanics and timelines of the  services
??? - The qualifications of arbitrators and  mediators
??? - Integration and data transfer  issues
??? - Dispute tracking events
??? - Incorporating adjunct services to  offer?a complete dispute management 
process
?
At the meeting you expressed interest and?support for  our?proposed 
services?and how they might benefit Enron.? Enron's  involvement?in 
developing and refining our services would be invaluable to  us, and if?there 
is someone at Enron who could  participate in our efforts, please let me 
know.? Alternatively, you can  simply forward this message to them?and they 
could get in touch with  me.
?
Should you have any questions, you can reach me by e-mail 
(gstrathmann@mediaone.net) or  telephone (978-376-9004).

Thank you.

The Joint Defense Agreement looks good,except for the application of Florida 
law. Have you looked at Fla. law?

With respect to limitations on possible claims, you have a good point. Please 
look at the limitations issue in light of what you know. An extensive review 
of the depositions doesn't seem warranted to me. I would also suggest we 
enter into a Tolling Agreement w/ Power systems ASAP. Call me to 
discuss--853-5587

Attached is the Joint Defense Agreement from Shook, Hardy & Bacon with my 
comments in redline. This agreement was sent to us to allow Enron access to 
the Power Systems' attorney's opinion regarding whether the proposed redesign 
for the New Albany and Doyle turbines might infringe GE patents.

My comments are intended to preserve Enron's rights to bring any claims that 
it may have against Power Systems. Do we have any other agreements of this 
type with Power Systems?  Some claims that Enron may have against Power 
Systems such as claims for breach of warranty may have limitations periods 
that are approaching.  I believe we have discussed having Bracewell review 
the depositions and any documents related to the installation of the 
allegedly infringing systems into Enron's facilities.  Please advise if you 
would like for us to undertake this review and ensure that any claims that 
Enron may have are protected.

Thanks.

The Trustee has proposed a conference call with Paulker on Nov. 8th beginning 
at
8:30 am our time.  Are you both still available and want to go forward at that
time.

Also, they have asked that we agree to delay the briefing on the arbitration
motion.  The request, from Jane, is that they would like to first see if we 
can
resolve this without the need to incur more legal fees and that a delay of a 
few
weeks to allow that process to continue will not prejudice either party.  The
schedule right now, as set by the court yesterday, is the Trust's response is
due on Nov. 13th. and our reply would be due on Nov. 17th.  The court is
scheduled to hear argument on Nov. 28th.

I like the idea of keeping pressure on them, but I don't view an extension as
unreasonable or as prejudicial to EPMI.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Richard and Elizabeth,

At Christian's suggestion, I am sending a memo I prepared summarizing some of 
the more exotic strategies used by our traders.  Christian has reviewed the 
memorandum and believes that it will assist you both in preparing for our 
Thursday meeting.  Between now and Thursday, Christian and I are going to 
analyze the ISO tariff to determine if the tariff prohibits any of these 
strategies.

Steve

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=
f=20
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=
=20
impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.

 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=
=20
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=
l=20
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=
e=20
to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance=
=20
carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20
including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=
ne=20
Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20
insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=
he=20
District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits=
=20
seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and=
=20
property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years=
=20
without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not=
=20
to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =
or=20
trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the=
=20
explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The=
=20
defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous=
=20
suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal=
=20
court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=
n=20
believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric=20
Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20
generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario=
n=20
County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=
d=20
not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20
Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruli=
ng=20
was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1995 general rate order which=
=20
granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=
n=20
Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=
s=20
stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and =
the=20
OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined=
=20
with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=
 =20
On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=
e=20
OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=
n=20
its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20
authorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=
n.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=
=20
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=
=20
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=
d=20
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=
=20
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=
=20
Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=
rt=20
of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=
ver a=20
return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=
n=20
accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility=
=20
Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the=20
proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of=
=20
State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=
e=20
new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has=
=20
indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20
elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionall=
y,=20
due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict,=
=20
with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regardi=
ng=20
PGE=01,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although n=
o=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=
=20
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requi=
re=20
expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20
operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating=
=20
sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to=
=20
result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses=
=20
are not expected to have a material impact on Enron=01,s financial position=
 or=20
results of operations.

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a=
=20
potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant=
=20
Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the=
=20
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=
A,=20
also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah=
=20
ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20
Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant=
 and=20
sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances=
=20
were released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20
predecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20
liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these=
=20
allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20
responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of=20
administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted=
=20
subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly=
=20
located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November=
=20
1998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999. =20
Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA=
. =20
Enron does not expect to incur any additional expenditures in connection wi=
th=20
this site.

 Enron=01,s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater=20
remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incu=
r=20
material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order 
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters

Gary,

The agreements we spoke of yesterday are being fedexed to you today.  After a 
more comprehensive look, it turns out that only the first few agreements had 
the unfortunate wording.  As the form of the agreement evolved with 
subsequent reviews and drafting, the problem disappeared.  At Richard 
Sanders' suggestion we interviewed the trader involved, and he was able to 
confirm that actual practices did not support the negative implications of 
some of the language.  Please call Steve and me with your comments after you 
have had a chance to review these documents.

 Although it is always a moving target when you try to interpret Randy's 
e-mails, when he says "more realistic" numbers, I think he is talking to you. 
I thought I heard that 1) Sterling's case was weak and 2) she has hired a 
more reasonable atty.
	Randal Maffett
	11/08/2000 04:21 PM
		 
As you know there are a couple of pending litigation issues outstanding 
(Waste Management, Lyon Credit/Hudson United Bank and Victoria Sterling).  
Per conversations w/ Richard Sanders he suggests setting aside $25K each for 
WMI and Lyon Credit.  Michelle suggested $250-300K for Sterling.

Based on our cash available and expense projections these reserves bankrupted 
us about two weeks ago!  I need further guidance on more realistic numbers.  
We don't have much room to work here and every dollar is precious to keep the 
lights on while we try and get this sale done.

Can you look into this

Have you heard of something called "Track changes"?  It's a WORD feature that 
is used -- a lot -- for redlining drafts.  I see it used all the time on 
documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.  It has become 
popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not 
compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are 
often missed in marked drafts.  
I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've 
forbidden use of "Track Changes" and are advising their clients to do the 
same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by 
someone who knows anything about word processing technology.  Which makes for 
interesting results in document discovery..... among other things.  Just 
thought I'd pass this along.

                                         Subject:     Jurisdiction --
Acceptable NY Courts

Here's a new one in our continuing saga of acceptable New York courts.

Currently, (with appropriate GC approval) we can specify United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York
County ("USDCSDNY") or
the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the Supreme Court of the State of
New York sitting in New York County.

In-house counsel for Chase Securities Inc. would not accept this provision
without a caveat that if a judge of the specified state court determined
that some other branch or division of such court sitting in NY County
should have jurisdiction, we had to accept jurisdiction in the other branch
or division.  Rather than risk ending up in an unacceptable forum, both
sides agreed to limit jurisdiction to the USDCSDNY.

I believe Joel may have checked earlier this year on New York courts with a
V&E litigator in New York.  If so, we might want to get further guidance on
this point.

Richard,

I have just received an invoice from Christophe Casabonne, the former EGLI 
trader who is our star witness/consultant in this matter, in the amount of 
15,600 FF.  This represents 19 hours and 30 minutes at the agreed-upon rate 
of 800 FF.  Although I have not checked today, the USD/FF conversion ratio 
was about 1/7 a few weeks ago.  If something like this still holds, the bill 
is for about $2,230.00.

I have reviewed the bill, find it in order, and ask for your authority to pay 
it.

I await your instructions.

Britt

yes. How much

Confidential and Privileged Attorney-Client Communication

I attended a seminar this morning at which Joan Feldman of Computer Forensics 
spoke.  I think it would be a good idea for us to have a conference call with 
Joan to review our email storage policy.   If you agree, I will have my 
assistant set one up.

A qualified yes.  It doesn't look to me that we have much choice. 
Remember--we were withholding freight as leverage to settle, which is a short 
term strategy at best. I am going to discuss it in detail w/ Britt Monday 
morning. I'll let you know if we come up with a better plan.

Do you concur with paying the freight without prejudice per the below notes?
	Britt Davis@ENRON

Paul,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got 
to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.  Let 
me know when you are available.  I can call you early a.m. or late p.m.  

Re the bug issue:  we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear 
that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.  I have discussed this 
in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning 
about what SGS told you.  We don't think we should put anyone on notice about 
the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint 
testing.  Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both 
Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a 
different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). 

Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:  David Best has just 
spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.  It is clear from 
her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration.  
It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement 
without Heard's advice.  Best believes that Heard will recommend that the 
joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.  In 
sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile 
effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now 
appears to David and me to be at a dead end.

Re the joint testing:  Again, David and I believe that the joint testing 
should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.  Neither our cargo 
underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.  Given 
the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the "bug" issue that SGS in Subic 
Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT 
that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our 
chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.  I 
have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting 
the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.  I would 
like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go 
forward.

Re the selection of arbitrators:  David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and 
Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.  Of those three, Hearn likes 
Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per 
day.  She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole 
arbitrator.  Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the 
choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to 
worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of 
arbitrator on it.  We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a 
formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already 
been accepted by Mitsubishi.

Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:  I 
read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim 
is only about $500,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my 
last e-mail).  As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this 
idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case.

Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said.

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, "pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the "pre-sale" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to "bugs". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
"bugs" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described "changes" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

We do utilize this feature.  How often it is used varies from assistant to 
assistant.  You would need to have access to a system computer or at the very 
least have the document transferred to diskette.   In the past we have not 
given up anything from our system computers.   Since we give nothing but hard 
copies, is this a problem for us?  Further, our retention policy states that 
all drafts are to be discarded once the deal has been completed.  

Would you like to see a demonstration of the track changes feature?

Have you heard of something called "Track changes"?  It's a WORD feature that 
is used -- a lot -- for redlining drafts.  I see it used all the time on 
documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.  It has become 
popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not 
compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are 
often missed in marked drafts.  
I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've 
forbidden use of "Track Changes" and are advising their clients to do the 
same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by 
someone who knows anything about word processing technology.  Which makes for 
interesting results in document discovery..... among other things.  Just 
thought I'd pass this along.  

Regards,
Janice

What is the status of our sending this out for execution via Sanders?

   Robert Walker                10/20/2000 10:03 AM

Attached is a copy of the Pintail Agreement you asked me to prepare.  The 
contract is effective 1/1/2000 for a term of 3 years at a price of 85% Inside 
Ferc HSC with a meter fee of $250 per meter.  Please take note of section 7.6 
of the agreement.  This section terminates the 70% Letter Agreement effective 
1/1/2000 and also states that Pintail is not a party to and has never been a 
party to the 1984 Conoco Agreement.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  If there are no changes to 
this Agreement, it is in a form that is ready to send to Pintail.  It is my 
understanding that you will send this with a release letter to Pintail.

Thanks,

Bob.\

Now that Melanie Gray has filed a notice of  appearance on ENA's behalf and 
is receiving copies of notices, pleadings, etc., in the Perry Gas matter, I 
propose that the Litigation Unit no longer process all notices received in 
Perry Gas through our service of process procedures.  Becky Stephens will 
continue to forward copies to me when received, and I will send a copy to you 
of anything that might appear to impact ENA, but, otherwise, we would not 
forward to you copies of notices of appearance and other filings that would 
not appear to directly impact ENA's rights.  Please let me know if this is 
okay with you, and, if it is not, let me know how you would like us to handle 
documents we receive in Perry Gas.  Thanks.

Richard,

You reviewed a letter from CMS a couple of weeks ago.  The company's senior 
management called me to ask what we saw that made us turn down the 
transaction.  I told them that I could not get specific because of the 
threatening overtone of their letter.  They suggested that they would be 
happy to send us a letter indemnifying us if it would allow EIP to sit down 
and walk through the issues that killed the deal.

I would like to be able to sit down with them to walk through these issues 
since EIP, as an organization, has been working with the company for almost a 
year.  I think they will sign a broad disclaimer.  Please get back to me as 
soon as possible with you suggestion for language.

Thanks,
Mark

this Court has heard, and denied, two prior appeals of virtually-identical

The meeting yesterday among Rogelio Lopez-Velarde, Jorge Canals (Enron's

I have shown the two playscapes that I have picked out for everyone to look
at.  I faxed to Richard, mailed to Doug and John, and Steve looked at it at
my house.  Obviously, there are much more fancy ones....and more money.  And
there are cheaper ones....that you can buy at Sam's or other warehouses and
put up yourself......

However, I picked out two that could go with our fort and sandbox out there
and really provide the swinging and climbing part of the playscape.  It was
affordable and they come out and set it up.

I would like to order soon.  They can have it too the Perd in about three
weeks.  So, please tell me what you think.

The simpler one is about 220 per family, and the bigger one is about 280 per
family.

Talk to you soon.

Are we interested in adding Porter & Hedges to our list of approved 
litigation counsel?  Mark Glatzer of that firm has called me and requested a 
meeting or lunch.  I don't want to encourage him if there's no hope.

Don't send anything until we talk.

Monday is not a problem.  Let me know if you have any concerns.

Everyone has signed off on the letter. Go ahead and send.

                    "Meringolo,

This is not good.  It seems as if Rozja (Peace's right hand man) or the CPUC 
handed Hoecker the questions and he said:  "Oh, I'll take care of getting the 
answers to these for you!"  Ron Carroll at Bracewell said he would work with 
the CPUC subpoena group in addressing these.

spoke at the Nov. 1 (I believe FERC means the 9th) meeting.  All but No. 3 
are  directed to Enron and the responses are due on Wednesday the 22nd.

I have reviewed the proposed filings with FERC, at least the latest drafts.
There were two issues related to the definition of market power and the
proposal for penalties for underscheduling load that I believed needed to be
changed and they were.  I believe those documents will be filed in the next
few hours.

As to CPUC, Harvey Morris has been tied up on the PUC's FERC filing and has
not called us.  Mike Day anticipates a call early Monday.   So far, no news
is good news.

If you need to reach me this holiday, I will be at our house in Inverness,
California.  (415) 669-1531 and I will check email periodically. Please have
a pleasant Thanksgiving with your family.

Thanks
Gary

The status of the case has not changed. On Monday the 27th the court will 
hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability. We expect to win. Badack 
is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery. I 
predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack 
has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million. We have offered $4.5 
million.

Badak is still in dispute.  Our litigation team headed by Richard Sanders is 
still negotiating with the company on some possible settlement.  We may need 
to write this balance down at some point.  I am not sure when to expect 
resolution to our negotiations. 

We will keep you posted as it progresses.

Brant - Can you give us an update on Badak?  Thanks.
Maybe you should speak to Bill Bradford or Brant Reves.  I'm not sure I have 
the latest news.  I can say that we terminated the positions and invoiced 
Badak after they failed to deliver (this was several months before my move to 
London).

If you'd like we can arrange a call with you, Bill and myself (I'd like 
someone from Houston to be involved).

Lisa/Richard/Bonnie,

Please give me an update of the following bankruptcy claims.  We need to make 
a determination if we should write off these receivables but would like to 
get input from you on any potential recovery before we move forward.  On a 
broader issue, do you have any report outlining outstanding bankruptcy 
preceedings or litigation that I may get a copy of on a regular basis so we 
can more effectively manage the credit and workout related issues on the 
trading portfolio?

Please advise.

Hi Tanya and Debbie,

I was wondering if I could get an update as to the status of the following 
bankrupt companies:

Alma Energy Corp.
Kimball Trading Company
Southern Mineral Corp.

For each company, we have an outstanding receivable on our A/R.  I was 
wondering if, in each case, we expected to see some money to offset the 
receivable, or if there was a slim chance that we would receive anything in 
bankruptcy proceedings.  

Please advise.

Thank you,
Becky

Richard,

I have just received an invoice from Christophe Casabonne, the former EGLI 
trader who is our star witness/consultant in this matter, in the amount of 
15,600 FF.  This represents 19 hours and 30 minutes at the agreed-upon rate 
of 800 FF.  Although I have not checked today, the USD/FF conversion ratio 
was about 1/7 a few weeks ago.  If something like this still holds, the bill 
is for about $2,230.00.

I have reviewed the bill, find it in order, and ask for your authority to pay 
it.

I await your instructions.

Britt

Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says
11/23/0 9:44 (New York)

     Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau
raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron
Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity
prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both
companies.
     The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two
companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on
Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both
Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and
denied they had broken any laws.
     Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the
investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the
bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.
     On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy
trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian
power project valued at $136 million.
     Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British
Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

Competition cops raided power firms Evidence of electricity price fixing 
sought in Enron , Powerex offices, warrant shows

reserved. 
The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by 
the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price 
fixing by the two companies. 
In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the 
summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of 
electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity 
exchange, Dow Jones reported. 
Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have 
been laid and denied breaking any laws. 
Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based 
Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. 
Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about 
the files. "It remains just allegations," he said. 
"We are confident that all of our activities have been in the rules of the 
Power Pool of Alberta and within applicable Canadian laws." 
Both he and Wayne Cousins, a spokesman for Powerex, the trading arm of 
British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,said they didn't know if their 
companies are still being investigated. 
"Powerex is confident that the bureau's investigation will find that the 
company has not violated the rules of the Alberta Power Pool," Mr. Cousins 
said. 
A spokesman from the Competition Bureau was not immediately available to 
confirm whether the investigation is continuing, but sources close to the 
bureau said it has been keeping an eye on the electricity markets in British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. 
While most of the bureau's monitoring has been in the form of advice, the 
regulator has taken steps for more direct intervention, sources said. 
Deregulation of the electricity market is still new and the market is not 
established, giving companies in the sector ample opportunity to play with 
the system, sources said. 
According to the search warrant, the bureau began investigating the two 
companies when Power Pool of Alberta system controllers noticed the price for 
a megawatt of electricity frequently rose above $100. 
In the Alberta system, participants submit bids to buy or sell power for the 
following day, and the price per megawatt of power is set by the most 
expensive unit needed to meet demand. 
Until the Power Pool changed its rules on Oct. 20, 1999, a participant could 
change the amount of power it bid or offered up until 20 minutes before the 
hour of transmission. The search warrant covers the companies' actions from 
June 1, 1999, to Oct. 19, 1999. 
Mr. Thode said investigations of this nature are common in deregulating 
markets. 
"It's happened in California this year, it's happened in the Midwest, it's 
happened around the globe. It's not unusual to see this type of investigation 
occur," he said. 
He added the Power Pool is required to call in the federal agency whenever 
there are allegations.

America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=

t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20

ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20

Richard: 

It was another great deposition day for the plaintiffs.? The high point was 
an audio taped phone conversation of Max Holmes' calling Stickler a liar.? A 
more detailed report is attached.

Frankly, I don't think McDonald and NatWest can let this case go to trial.? 
They will almost surely lose, and lose big, and PaineWebber could be drawn in 
too.? I think I will make a renewed pitch to Bruce MacLeod (Farallon's lawyer 
here this week) to let ECT out.? I will keep you posted.

Here are the revised dates for the response/reply/and hearing dates for
Enron's motion to compel.  As you may recall, they say they want a
deposition on the parties'  intention.  We should be expecting a deposition
notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat.

I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A&K has filed
setting forth the Trustee's position in connection with the
enforcement/nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the
Trustee is seeking.  As you see below, she is pulling those together.

Call to discuss the response to the Trustee's settlement offer.

Thanks.
Hi--Talked to Craig and the Court today.  The motion to compel is now
scheduled for Dec. 12 at 2p.m.  The trustee's oppositon papers are now due
Nov 27 and Enron reply is due Dec 1.  I have my paralegal gathering the
pleadings Enron requested.  That is all for now.--Liz

Attached is an updated status report re ENA litigation.

I agree that we should send such a letter.

It's a two way street, of course.  Have they expressed any interest in
negotiating?  There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation, but nothing
particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show.
Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them.

Where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece?

As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is
not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the alternative, and that
our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators (since Duke
clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage, having already seen
ours).  Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP
(the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an
economic hardship under the contract.  What say ye?

In the three years I have been here, I am unaware of an ENA/ECT bad faith 
claim against any insurance company. Anyone else? If so, please contact 
Michelle.

Justin, I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas 
but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here.  I've 
read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations 
appropriately.  

Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in 
Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed??  We sued Houston Casualty 
last year but I don't recall making any bad faith claims.  It settled anyway, 
a long time ago.
mb

Michelle,
Did you get my fax on Friday? I guess the questions on which I should like
your steer are: (a) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference
to bad faith proceedings made by United India? (b) Is it right that Enron
has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas? (c) Are you happy with the
draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you?

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.

Justin

Not when I was there, but I wasn't there the whole time.

Michelle and Ken,

were you able to discuss the "bad faith" proceedings issue yesterday? If
you
got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give
me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position
clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.

Justin

Dear Mr. Sanders - 
?
While I left a you a phone message with some information about  our project, 
I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as  well...
?
We are still very interested in having Enron support our  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses  from companies such 
as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,  and I would be 
pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal  point for our 
educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,  is related to 
the services we will provide to support the aspirational  statements of the 
Protocol.

I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American  
Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for 
eCommerce  B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small 
working  groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial 
service  offerings.

Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our  technology 
consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half  a 
day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from  finance, 
legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback  about 
our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief  
description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for  
discussion at the meeting.

The real focus of the meeting will be on how  we should build these services 
to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B  marketplaces.? We are very 
concerned with providing services that are  relevant to that environment.

We would like to meet between November 14  and?December 1?since construction 
of our services is already  underway.? Please let me know what is possible, 
and feel free to give me a  call if you have any questions (978-376-9004).
?
Thanks.

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the

 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.

 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.

 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Dynegy
Marketing and Trade. It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity
which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and
the class, and is a WSCC member.  Dynegy operates two electricity generating
power plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the
California Power Exchange.
 11.  Defendant NRG Energy, Inc. (hereinafter "NRG") is a Minneapolis,
Minnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as NRG, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately
sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class.  In
partnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating
plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California
Power Exchange.
12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter "AES") is an Arlington,
Virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which
is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the
class, and a WSCC member.  AES Pacific Group operates four electricity
generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity
to the California Power Exchange.
13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public
corporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy
Marketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale
electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including
plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  Williams Energy Marketing and
Trading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern
California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power
Exchange.
14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter "Duke Energy") is a
Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of
California as Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, a generator and trader
of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers,
including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates
four electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale
electricity to the California Power Exchange.
 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.
/ / /
  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;
(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and
(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

Lawsuit Filed In San Diego Vs Enron For Power Mkt Abuses

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego 
Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, 
overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity 
service. 
On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy 
Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), 
AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class 
action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. 
The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A 
news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday 
morning in San Diego.
Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is 
active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate 
contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back 
into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold 
in the state. 
An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable 
to comment. 
The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply 
last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used 
real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. 
The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion 
for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Dynegy
Marketing and Trade. It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity
which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and
the class, and is a WSCC member.  Dynegy operates two electricity generating
power plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the
California Power Exchange.
 11.  Defendant NRG Energy, Inc. (hereinafter "NRG") is a Minneapolis,
Minnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as NRG, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately
sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class.  In
partnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating
plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California
Power Exchange.
12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter "AES") is an Arlington,
Virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which
is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the
class, and a WSCC member.  AES Pacific Group operates four electricity
generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity
to the California Power Exchange.
13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public
corporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy
Marketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale
electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including
plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  Williams Energy Marketing and
Trading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern
California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power
Exchange.
14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter "Duke Energy") is a
Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of
California as Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, a generator and trader
of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers,
including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates
four electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale
electricity to the California Power Exchange.
 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;

My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative. It seems like alot of 
busywork.  My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term 
strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some 
benefit to the meeting. However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda 
or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly. The 
transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 
37459. I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call.

Talked with Gerry today and he and his group are coming to meet with me next 
week.  He suggested we get a "business type" involved.  Since this is B2B 
oriented can you suggest someone from Louise Kitchen's group (aren't they 
doing the B2B internet transactions?) Should I just contact someone in her 
group directly?

Dear Mr. Sanders - 
?
While I left a you a phone message with some information about  our project, 
I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as  well...
?
We are still very interested in having Enron support our  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses  from companies such 
as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,  and I would be 
pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal  point for our 
educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,  is related to 
the services we will provide to support the aspirational  statements of the 
Protocol.

I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American  
Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for 
eCommerce  B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small 
working  groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial 
service  offerings.

Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our  technology 
consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half  a 
day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from  finance, 
legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback  about 
our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief  
description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for  
discussion at the meeting.

The real focus of the meeting will be on how  we should build these services 
to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B  marketplaces.? We are very 
concerned with providing services that are  relevant to that environment.

We would like to meet between November 14  and?December 1?since construction 
of our services is already  underway.? Please let me know what is possible, 
and feel free to give me a  call if you have any questions (978-376-9004).
?
Thanks.

Richard,

I have confirmed with David Best this morning that the settlement in this 
matter is "done and dusted", to use David's phrase.  I have received, and 
will shortly send to you, a letter from our underwriters' counsel, confirming 
the settlement.  Payment will be made within twenty-one days, which means 
before year-end.  Our barrister and expert have been advised to stop work 
immediately.  Parenthetically, we were able to avoid becoming liable for the 
7,500 pound advance to our barrister that would have otherwise come due last 
Friday.

Let me know if you want me to participate in a conference with John Nowlan to 
explain our reasons for the settlement.  By the way, this finally wraps up 
all the M/V HAVMANN arbitration/litigation.  Best advises that there is no 
one left for us to pursue, and no one left who is pursuing us.

One question:  Best wants to know if you want the $475,000 to come directly 
to us, or to come to him, and to be disbursed to us by him net of agreed fees 
and expenses that we owe.  One way or another, I assume that you ultimately 
want the money wired to us, but I wonder if you know of a person (or 
department) from whom to determine the proper wire transfer account/address.  
If not, I am sure that I can find out.  Thanks.

Britt

Please set this up

Richard and Doug: Pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court 212, counsel for all 
parties are required to meet and confer to discuss the issues set forth below 
no later than 30 days before a case management conference.? As you know, a 
case management conference is scheduled for June 2, 2000.? Plaintiff's 
counsel contacted me today and asked that we (along with counsel for GSF) 
conduct the meet and confer via telephonic conference on Tue., May 2, 2000 at 
4:00 p.m.

The issues to be discussed are as follows: 

1)????? Service of all anticipated parties; 
2)????? Related cases; 
3) ???? Facts that are presently available to support the pleadings filed by 
each party; 
4)????? Injuries; 
5)????? Damages; 
6)????? Whether the amount in controversy will exceed $25,000; 
7)????? Alternative dispute resolution, including mediation, arbitration; 
8)????? Anticipated law and motion; 
9)????? Preliminary schedules of discovery; 
10)???? Possible settlement; and 
11)???? Other relevant matters. 

Although many of these issues are directed to a plaintiff, we too will need 
to take positions on many of these items, particularly Nos. (3) & (7) - 
(10).? We also need to better understand the nature of the dispute and our 
strategy going forward.

I would like to set up a conference call for Monday, May 1, 2000 at 11:00 
a.m. (PST) to discuss the foregoing.? Please let me know if this time is 
convenient for you.

before the end of November.  That would be great if you can do it.  (I can
give you wire info if you need it.)  If we don't make November (I know
you're swamped!), December would be OK, but it is very important to us that
we get caught up by year end.  Let me or Barry know if there's anything we
need to do.

I don't know what precipitated the onslaught of questions, but as Corporate 
Risk Management is the business charged with the responsibility of dealing 
with United India, one of only four Indian insurance companies, and because 
we have a sizable book of business there and anticipate more,  I need to be 
brought into the loop on what the problem is or what the allegations are 
about. I believe that I am aware of all of the lawsuits filed by various 
Enron entities against insurance companies since 1986, and only one of those 
was filed in Texas.  I believe that Michelle has already addressed that 
issue.  Someone please advise me or Jim Bouillion what this is about.

Here is the FERC Order on California issues.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order 
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters 
and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their 
Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on 
this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding?

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EESI"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").  We
make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with
the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering
to produce or producing documents, these entities have not waived any
objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims,
defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have
been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.
For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from
disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Data
will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, ESSI, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchase
and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   We anticipate
producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and
the transaction data in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are very small and there will probably be limited documents
available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling
coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, do
not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit
requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.
 For Portland General, there will be a very large volume of documents
and we propose to handle them differently.  First, Portland General will
provide for year 2000 electronic data in summary form similar to the data
being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant.  With respect
to specific generating cost data, because of the volume, we suggest that
these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a
representative sampling of facilities.  If there are specific documents that
the Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss the
arrangements for producing these documents.  We propose to make these
documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Request 13, 15, 16, 17, 19

 We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data for
year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity,
delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is purchase or sale.   Because
of the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that some
entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those transactions where EPMI
served only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO will
show part of the transaction, but there will not be a corresponding
transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.  The reason is that
this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on an
accounting system rather than as part of the trading business.  EESI can
also provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will not
include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide
a blind customer number.  Many of ESSI's customers have agreements whereby
they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.
ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its
customers the notice they require.  We anticipate producing the transaction
data in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.

 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Today, Friday, Gary Fergus of the Brobeck firm and I met with Attny. Harvey
Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the
five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We
negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an
opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of
the request for production of documents.   This will include a further
extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a
reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We
are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in
Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections.

However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and
senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications,
Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with
the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the
overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme
pressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what was
happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "many
parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the
Governor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing
responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of
cooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" which
would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such
parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.

This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC.
I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never
invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so
by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded
that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply
trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery
requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment
speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve
a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron
officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this
incident.

Jim-- do I need to be doing something on this-----that is other than 
strangling whoever gave this guy an Enron business card.
Rob Cole
05/01/2000 09:18 AM
I received a telephone call this past Friday from a Mr. Jes Jensen 
(406-238-1900) who is located in Montana and who claimed to be the insurance 
agent for the propane tanker which was struck by Mr. Van Scoyk.  He was 
wanting me to participate in a 9:30am conference call this morning with his 
clients as the claims that they are getting the run around from the rental 
company and he was hoping we could do something as we were Mr. Van Scoyk's 
employer.

I called him back and advised that Mr. Van Scoyk was not our employee, but 
rather an independent contractor who was performing Land Man services.  He 
He said his clients have sustained both property damage, and loss of use for 
not being able to deliver propane; yet, he could not tell me if they have 
mitigated their damages by having the vehicle repaired (I find this strange 
since he is their agent).  I told him he needed to look to Enterprise 
(although Mr. Van Scoyk) did not purchase liability coverage, and after them, 
Mr. Van Scoyk's personal auto carrier.  He said Enterprise had no 
responsibility to handle this matter as he did not purchase any liability 
coverage.  Also, he intimated that the personal auto carrier for Mr. Van 
Scoyk has (or was in the process of) denying the claim since Mr. Van Scoyk 
was using the rental vehicle for "business purposes" (he also advised that 
Mr. Van Scoyk worked this area all the time, had used his personal auto in 
the process, but that it was in the shop that day for repairs).

I advised Mr. Jensen to forward me whatever information he possessed that 
would assist me in this matter, to include a photocopy of the aforementioned 
business card.  Do you know if ENA obtains business cards for independent 
contractors such as Mr. Van Scoyk?  Is there any chance of obtaining the 
actual signed copy of the CONSULTING SERVICES AGREEMENT sent to Mr. Van 
Scoyk, short of going to his family?  Does anyone from ENA validate the 
insurance requirements of the aforementioned AGREEMENT, such as obtaining a 
copy of the pertinent declarations page or the policy itself for review?

Who in the field can I discuss this matter with futher as I am interested in 
further exploring our relationship to Mr. Van Scoyk and would like to speak 
with someone first-hand.  Mr. Jensen was told to call me by a Ken Choice 
(Joyce?) or Jessica Winthrop when he called the number on Mr. Van Scoyk's 
business card.

Your prompt attention to this matter would be appreciated.  I will forward to 
you whatever is faxed to me by Mr. Jensen.

Thanks,

Rob

Here it is:

I have some dope on the judge as well.  He was a very small time lawyer out
in La Mesa (the sticks) with a general practice that  included litigation.
He was a family law judge until he was made an overflow general civil judge
in 1998.  None of the lawyers whom I have listed would be likely to have a
relationship with him from their days in practice.  Also, he may not keep
the case, given its high profile, and the fact that it is related to the
case filed against the generators, which has a lower number.  People who
know Judge Meyer say he is pompous and not very bright.

He practiced with three lawyers. One of them went on the bench and is now
retired.  Another has also retired.  The remaining one is LeRoy Knutson, who
is of counsel in a small firm in El Cajon, also the sticks.

FYI.
Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC's questions.  It is still
missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting.  I
believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft.
He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego
litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to
specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers
market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine
that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.
Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate
the problem.  There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get
it, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal
court that there has been preemption.  As a practical matter, however, our
preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to
preempt anti-trust laws, for example, the preemption argument may be
difficult to make anyway.  Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the one
chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.  If FERC does make the
finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not know how to assess the
likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding, and if they do whether
it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit
analysis.

 If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional
phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  "if they were not in
violation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs."

 Talk to you tomorrow.

Thanks
Gary

As you will see, the attached draft incorporates Sue's and Mary's drafts as
well as additional text from me.  The comments filed on Nov. 22 are
literally one foot high. If the Commission is serious about getting an order
out by mid-December, it is thus highly unlikely that it will carefully
review any of the Comments other than the major players (CPUC, Gov. Davis,
the UDCs).  I do believe, however, that Chairman Hoecker, the Commissioners
and the high level Staffers will be more likely to review the responses to
Hoecker's questions.  Thus, if we are to have any realistic hope that they
will focus on our arguments, I thought it advisable to use these responses
as an advocacy piece rather than a mere discovery response.  Hence, I
suggest a lengthy rather than minimalist response.

I thought that Gary's concern in an earlier email about Alan's rebuttal to
the J&K piece was well taken.  I have thus taken out all references to a
need to do more analysis on the market abuse issue, and recast his write-up
as simply a rebuttal of the J&K Study.

Finally, the draft (which I have included in Word and WP formats/ the WP
format may paginate more accurately) is no doubt in need of wordsmithing;
any suggestions would be well appreciated.

I would like to file this tomorrow, so please call or email me as early in
the morning as possible.  (I am not sending this email from my computer, so
please create a new email to me when you respond rather than simply hit the
"reply" button to this email.)  Talk to you tomorrow (Friday).

conflicted.  Another has as one of its partners, the wife of Len Simon, the
lead plaintiff's counsel in our case.  Assuming that conflicts can be
resolved, we have five different lawyers available to be interviewed on
Monday.

assume that  the removal clock is ticking.
News Reports

 We have identified a service that has recorded the news reports
about this lawsuit.  There are 28 hits so far for TV reports.  It will cost
$300 per clip to obtain them.  Do you know if Enron is getting these clips
from the public relations firm?  Should we get them?

Anti-Trust Law School Professors.

Attached is the discussion of our net earnings for question 2.  I also did a 
little tinkering with the last paragraph from the last version I sent.  I 
haven't looked at Ron's proposal yet so if Ron rewrote this paragraph I may 
want to defer to what he said or figure out how to "simonize" (ha ha) the 
two.  Sorry to send this to you so late.  I thought I had sent it yesterday 
but forgot to click the send button on my E-mail.  No wonder no one was 
sending any comments!

   

Gary, Thanks for your comments.  They were most helpful.

I agree that I have swung for the fences in that discussion, and I am not 
overly optimistic that FERC will reach out and specifically assert preemption 
(although its assertion of preemption could be implicit in its actions).  I 
thought that the argument that the market would be damaged by ongoing 
litigation might have some appeal at FERC, and it was worth a shot.

Until I read your email, I thererfore saw no downside in asking.  The 
question that I have for you is how strong would an allegation in court be 
that the mere fact that we asked for a preemption finding, as to which FERC 
did not address, constitutes a negative finding that FERC elected not to 
assert preemption.  Not having done the research, my sense was that such a 
result would have no precedential effect, along the lines that a denial a 
cert by the Supreme Court is not precedential.  This is an important point.  
Perhaps we could schedule a call with Mary, et al., to discuss strategy.    
Ron

Ron,
 Your latest draft has minimized the earlier concerns that I had.
You are definitely swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego
litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, you are asking FERC to
specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers

that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.  There
is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it, that fact will

has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti-trust laws,
for example, the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway.  I
know that this may be the one chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.
If FERC does make the finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not
know how to assess the likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding,
and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal, so it is difficult for
me to do a risk benefit analysis.

 If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional
phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  "if they were not in
violation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs."

 I know Mary is still working on the economics response.  I will look
at as soon as it comes in.

Thanks

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

Travis,

 I reviewed an "Agreement for Project Services" having an effective
date of May 20, 1999 and a "Project Work Description" (PWD) with a date in
the title of May 27, 1999, which includes an Attachment A.  The PWD and its
Attachment A apparently modify the 5/20/99 agreement, but reference it as
the 5/21/99 agreement in the preamble and above the signature line.  The
5/20/99 agreement conveys (in paragraphs 4.8.1 and 4.8.2) any intellectual
property rights that Agency.com may have acquired to Enron Corp.  Attachment
A, however, added a paragraph 4.10 that begins with the following sentence:
"Company shall obtain no intellectual property rights to the Work unless it
has made timely payments of all reasonable and undisputed fees."

 Please confirm that "reasonable and undisputed fees" were paid and
that there is no 5/21/99 agreement.

Richard, 

Folllowing our meeting of the 9th November, I have now written a business 
requirements document, which will be included in the final specification to 
be sent out to the vendors under consideration for the supply of voice 
recording services. This document is attached below. 

Before sending out this document I wanted you to have the opportunity to 
review the content and comment upon any statements made within it. 
In order to progress this component of the ECS project we will be sending out 
a specification at the end of November, so if any feedback could be given 
before that deadline, it would be appreciated. 

I will ensure you are also sent a copy of the final specification provided to 
the suppliers. 

Thank you for your assistance with this matter. 

Regards

Stuart Fieldhouse

ENA has been asked to deliver a legal opinion which will be dated December 7, 
2000 in connection with its delivery of a ISDA Master Agreement.  Are you 
aware of any litigation or proceeding, threatened or ongoing, which would 
question the validity of the ISDA Master Agreement.  I ask this in connection 
with my opinion due diligence.

Richard - 

The following two invoices don't have work orders setup:

1.  Bracewell & Patterson Re:  Berry Group, Ltd. and Berry Contracting, LP v. 
2.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges Re:  ENA/Perry Gas
 Amount:  $108.00  (Invoice #1009176B)
                   $352.50  (Invoice #10013082B)

Should these be coded to General Litigation or do you want me to set up new 
work orders?  If so, who should they be allocated to (Team Leader)?

I have reviewed a copy of the notice and summons which were served on ENA by 
Blue Grass Synfuels, et al.  I notice that there was no complaint served with 
the summons.  I assume you will be engaging counsel in New York to represent 
ENA in this matter.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to assist.  
Also, if the complaint is ultimately served on our outside counsel (rather 
than through ordinary service of process) after ENA serves its Notice of 
Appearance, please make sure to send Corporate Risk Management (Jim Studdert) 
a copy of the Complaint, so that it can be reviewed for possible coverage.  I 
know the matter sounds like breach of contract, but it's worth having the 
insurance review done if any quasi-tort claims are made.  

The deposition will not take place. I talked to the litigation manager at WM 
about settlement today. We are going to talk again Monday.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

Senator Burton, President Pro-Tem, has asked for the name and address of
all the CEOs of the "generators".   This request has come through Julie
Malinowski from the Independent Energy Producers' (IEP) lobbying firm,
Edson and Modisette.  Burton gave her a list on which Enron appeared.  I
asked her to eliminate us from the list and say that we are not generators.
If Burton comes back anyway, I have given Julie the names and addresses of
Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.

Hi Richard.  We are close to finalizing a sale of our Pastoria project in 
California to Calpine.  I've got you listed as a "knowledge" party of ENA for 
purposes of making a rep regarding litigation.  Could you please take a look 
at Section 4.1(i) of the attached draft, and let me know if there are any 
actions required to be scheduled for the rep to be accurate.  At this point, 
my proposed Schedule 4.1(i) says "none", and, hopefully, that statement is 
still accurate.  We're on a timetable that requires me to ask for your 
response by the end of theday tomorrow (Thursday).  Thanks. --  kj

 This morning, I executed and telefaxed Enron Metals' agreement to defend and 
indemnify Scottsboro in this matter to Scottsboro.  I just received a 
voice-mail from Dean Vanek, Scottsboro's general counsel, who said that the 
agreement looked fine to him.  He has referred me to his attorney, Tom 
Walker, of Walker, Johnston, Barton and Powell, out of Birmingham.  Walker is 
Scottsboro's usual attorney.  I have left an urgent message with Walker, who 
is out of the office in a seminar today, and won't be back in until tomorrow, 
to call me immediately about getting an extension of time to answer in this 
matter from the plaintiff.  The answer date is Monday.

 Richard, given that Walker is not defending us, but Scottsboro, and the 
small size of this case ($15,000), do we need to pass this by Jim Derrick for 
his approval?  Given the short time frame before an answer is due, I will go 
forward with retaining him provisionally, at least to get an extension of 
time.  I would be strongly inclined not to substitute any other counsel in, 
as it might give away that it is Enron Metals who is funding Scottsboro in 
this matter.

FYI re: DOJ/CA Situation.  I'm not sure what to make of this in light of the 
upcoming change in the Administration, but I thought you would want to be 
aware of it.  Also, although the focus appears to be generators, I would 
assume that if DOJ elected to go forward andy investigation would be likely 
to expand to include major marketers.  John

Friday December 15, 1:03 pm Eastern Time
Justice Dept Asked to Probe Power Crisis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked to 
investigate whether possible collusion and other illegal activities among 
power generators are behind the huge jump in California's electricity and 
natural gas prices.

``We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the 
electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers,'' California 
Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and California State Senate President Pro 
Tempore John Burton said in a letter to Reno late on Thursday.

``We request that the Department of Justice investigate potential collusion 
and any other unlawful acts by generators in the electricity market,'' they 
added.

They noted in the letter that one-fourth of the state's generating plants -- 
representing 11,000 megawatts of power -- were shut down last weekend, 
allegedly for repairs or routine maintenance, when California citizens faced 
rolling blackouts.

``Some have suggested that one reason for plant shutdowns is that in some 
cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate 
their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market,'' they said.

If true, Boxer and Burton said it would explain some of the electricity 
shortage problems and raise concern about irregular activity in the natural 
gas market.

In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking 
them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced 
power shortages.

Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,400 per 
megawatt hour.

Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a 
new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when 
Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January.

``However, this crisis in upon us now,'' they said. ``I hope you will take 
immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of 
leadership for the new attorney general to follow.''

Hello, Mr. Sanders.  I am Marty Sunde's assistant and I am writing regarding 
the 11/22/00 letter from Palmer, Guest & Esses regarding Euell Energy 
Resources.  The letter was addressed to Mr. Lay and Marty Sunde in EES 
received a copy.  We sent the letter to our General Counsel, Vicki Sharp, who 
advises that she passed it on to you for handling.  As the 12/15/00 deadline 
(set forth in Mr. Esses' letter) is approaching, I thought I would follow up 
to see if a response has been provided to them.  If this has already been 
taken care of, would you be so kind as to fax a copy of the letter to us for 
our file.  Our fax number is (713) 646-2199.

with approving them piece-meal.  I trust that you will shortly be receiving 
payment from underwriters and do not want to I delay getting you authority

immediate help.

1.  Please press whoever owes us their outstanding bills to get them to us as 
soon as possible.

2.  With regard to the Minton's bills, can you get me an itemized breakdown?

3.  With regard to the barrister's fees, can we get something that will allow 
us to determine how much time/what billing rate applies to each of these 
entries?  I am mindful and appreciative that he apparently hasn't billed us 
in four years.

4.  With regard to the arbitrator's fees and expenses, is any more detail 
available (total time spent/rate)?

Many thanks for your immediate help.

Richard:   I've put on the fax to you a copy of 2 of our invoices for legal 
services on the Brazos FERC/Cert. matter--one from Sept. and one from 
November--that are still outstanding.  I thought in particular that the Sept. 
invoice may have been lost in the system since an invoice for the following 
month has been paid.   Also, I know that the Sept invoice had originally been 
sent to Dan Lyons since we also were doing related work on the Brazos project 
and Dan was the supervising attorney for the project overall, but my 
understanding from Dan was that he was going to send the litigation related 
invoice to your attention for your review and approval.  As you will recall 
from your Bracewell days, this is the time of the year that the internal law 
firm billing people hound the partners to follow up on outstanding bills.  Of 
course, if you have any questions on the invoice or need any further 
information, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thanks , Richard.  I hope 
that you are doing well and bearing up ok in the face of the day to day 
turmoil in CA.

Item #11 (retained) has changed and needs to be updated on the schedule.  
Pintail has elected not to accept our proposal and has submitted termination 
under the contract.  Their future actions are unknown at this time.

The potential arbitration proceedings with Shanghai needs to be added to the 
list as a retained litigation.  Contact Britt Davis for details.

Item #3 (unretained) probably needs to clarify the current situation.  In 
this proceeding, it is my understanding that HPL has already condemned the 
property and posted the appropriate bond as per the Court order.  The 
landowners were not satisfied with the findings of the Commissioners and have 
filed suit seeking a higher value.

It is unknown at this time whether there will be any litigation that comes 
out of the A/S pipeline rupture incident in Mt Belvieu.

                      Attorney-Client Privileged Communication

Since litigation has begun with Sempra, Somerset and Blue Grass, we should
see to it that documents relating to the issues in the lawsuit are
preserved.  For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also
documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video
recordings.
It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this
practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is
that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and
determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me
for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a
conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to
address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know.
We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it
forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete.

It is not clear to me what precipitated this most inquiry from Anadarko or
why it is being made at this time.  I thought that we had gotten over this
hump.

Assuming that you are not anxious for this task, I propose that I tell them
that, because you are currently tied up on other matters, I will be the
temporary representative on the committee and that after the holidays we
will be back in touch further.

Such a response would parry this somewhat odd inquiry / statement, and will
allow us to reassess the situation when Andy gets on board and gets his feet
wet.

Agree?

Please advise whether Mr. Tetrault or Mr. Sanders will represent Enron on
the Wright Steering Committee.  We have agreed to make a concerted effort to
obtain the approval of all Steering Committee members in connection with
significant group decisions.

Richard,

I have received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Mark D. 
Gately, now of Hogan and Hartson.  Gately was the lead partner on this file 
with Miles & Stockbridge before he changed firms toward the end of the case.  
He is billing us for 6.75 hours at $325 an hour, for a total of $2,193.75.  I 
find the bill in order and ask for your authority to place it in line for 
payment.  

I have also received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Miles & 
Stockbridge, for work done from October to date.  There are three timekeepers 
(with billing rates from $290 to $115 an hour) who charged a total of 17.70 
hours, for total fees of $4,101, and total expenses of $1,1129.30, for a 
total bill of $ 5,230.00.  I find the bill in order and ask for your 
authority to place it in line for payment.

Let me know if you wish to review either bill yourself, or whether you wish 
to pay the bills yourself.

Britt

I have signed several approvals for her but I am not sure why they are coming

Sorry to hear that you have yet not successfully off loaded your duties of
as unofficial secretary of the group.

Andy, not me, will be the Enron representative on the Steering Committee.  I
had subbed at a meeting 10 or so days ago because Richard Sanders had been
tied up on an extended project.  Andy will handle it from this point
forward.

I will ask Andy to copy you on the information that he sends to Tom
Nicholas.

Hope you have a nice holiday.

Charles -

Did you mean that you also wanted to participate on the Wright Steering
Committee ?  Our approach has been that only in-house counsel will
participate;  it is only in the event that an in-house attorney is unable to
participate on the committee that outside counsel has been proxied in.
Please advise.

Could you also have Andy cc: me on his E-mail to Tom forwarding his contact
information.  As the secretary (of sorts) of the Steering Committee, I have
been maintaining updated information for the groupl.

CFP and I discussed my question, posed
to both you and her, about whether I
needed to involve others at my firm in this
case.  Her view was no, and I do not
disagree.  But I did not hear from you
and, still scarred from my prior error in
assuming that CFP spoke for Enron, I
would like to have your view.  So, again: do you want Geoff Harrison, Vineet 
Bhatia
or Steve Susman involved in this case? Right now it is being handled by a

transfer any of the files to me at my new firm.

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly 
inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please 
comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, 
as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and 
haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next 
steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message 
in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit).

Julie,  I'm working with Legal and Bob Surles with Lynx Energy Company on 
some pricing issues regarding meter 6677.  I have verified with Bob Fischer 
in the Transport Group the transportation rates that HPLC is paying to Gulf 
Coast Pipeline Company, which in turn must be paid to HPLC by Lynx Energy.   
Would you please change Sitara to reflect the transportation rates shown on 
the schedule below?  Also, I've recalculated the average price and need you 
to make those changes too. Thanks.

Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no 
absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity 
of "in the market" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to 
review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel 
this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the 
other events. I also feel this should significantly quiet their stance.

I agree

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation 
indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Thanks,

Please note that Jan and Feb business was paid on time. The March invoice was 
sent out for $101,370 and she will continue to keep me informed of any 
developments on her end as she is in communication with the counterparty.

	
	

Veronica,

I spoke with Pittsburgh Corning about our current month natural gas 
receivables. Per Harry Fleming, they have filed Chapter 11 and are in court. 
He transferred me to Jill Kio who informed me that they submitted Enron's 
invoice for payment before they filed so they do not expect to delay payment. 
However, as they do not know what the outcome of court will be, they can not 
promise the payment will NOT be delayed.

Jill is faxing me some paperwork on their filings and I will forward that to 
you upon receipt. If you have any questions, please do not hestitate to call.

The 18th w/ Sat possibility is better.

Aleck --

I have not yet been paid for the work I did for Enron via Blakes.  I
sent Blakes an invoice for about US$20,000 early in August -- yes,
almost 5 months ago -- and have received nothing since.  I have asked
Web MacDonald several times to check on it.  The last response I heard
from Blakes was over a month ago, when they said they would remind
Enron.  Then, about three weeks ago, I was asked by an attorney in San
Francisco to assist him with some Enron work related to California.  I
told him that, in my experience, Enron does not pay its bills, so he
offered me an advance retainer.  He also said he had checked with the
appropriate person at Enron in Houston, who said that he had just
approved payment of my invoice.  But that was over three weeks ago and I
still have seen nothing.

My letter agreement is with Blakes, not Enron, so I had assumed that
Blakes would pay me and invoice Enron themselves.  But Blakes seems
unwilling to pay me themselves and unable to get Enron to pay me
directly.  I would appreciate any assistance you can provide on this
matter.

Thanks, and do have a Merry Christmas.

Larry

assured him that my invoice which I agreed to do when he said he would
pay a retainer in advance.

He transferred me to Jill Kio who informed me that they submitted Enron's

promise the payment will NOT be delayed.

Jill is faxing me some paperwork on their filings and I will forward that to 
you upon receipt. If you have any questions, please do not hestitate to call.

The main problem in getting him paid was that Blakes didn't send me his bill 
until Nov. We have processed the bill and he should have already received his 
money. I will call Larry today to apologize.

	Aleck Dadson
	12/29/2000 01:56 PM
		 
Larry Ruff sent along a note indicating that his invoice  (US$20,000)  for 
consulting services re Stanley has not been paid, 5 months after it was first 
submitted to Blakes.  He was told by Web MacDonald of Blakes that it had been 
submitted to Enron Corp in Houston for payment.  Hopefully we can expedite 
payment.  Evidently Larry has been approached by Enron's California counsel 
to do some work out there for Enron and Larry insisted on a retainer given 
his experience on Stanley.   Regards, Aleck

Schultes is the original CEO of NSM.  Let me know if you are interested.
	showard@agsk.com

Schultes' lawyer has asked us if John can call an Enron business person

project that Schultes is pushing.  Think anyone at Enron is interested?  If
so, who?

We told the lawyer that John should not call unless we clear it with you
first.

Brian's deposition is now firm for 1/18, 1/19, and possibly 1/20 in Houston. 
Let's plan on prep on 1/16 and 1/17.

McConville's deposition seems to have fallen off the radar screen again.

Hennegan also wants  to depose Julien Smythe at Akin Gump, which may be a
little troublesome fo us.

Any thoughts on this question?
	Richard Lydecker@ENRON

Not only no, but hell no.  Once burned (badly), twice shy (exponentially).  
The best and only development on NSM I would like to see is to get out the 
litigation morass and (hopefully) be a little wiser next time.

Seriously, if the project does get reorganized (sans Enron additional 
investment), what does that mean in terms of any potential recovery for the 
existing debt?  Presumably any reorganization would come out of a bankruptcy 
plan.  Any hope?

I have attached an e-mail from Steve Howard, our atty in the NSM litigation. 
Schultes is the original CEO of NSM.  Let me know if you are interested.
	showard@agsk.com
	01/02/2001 04:30 PM
		 
Schultes' lawyer has asked us if John can call an Enron business person
concerning a possible investment by Enron in some reorganized form of the
project that Schultes is pushing.  Think anyone at Enron is interested?  If
so, who?

We told the lawyer that John should not call unless we clear it with you
first.

Knox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met 
Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston 
Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 
year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his 
daughter would  be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded 
custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix 
called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his 
second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income 
threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to 
handle it as a favor to me. At the time,  Felix had a job at a laundry 
company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a 
garage making $500(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six 
months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year 
old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously 
considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother 
and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his 
divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is 
current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to 
move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his 
daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of 
brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in 
law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the 
mother in law  asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An 
attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, 
I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&E would take on 
his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help.

I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your 
voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being 
handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next 
week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, 
I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business 
contact--a short and sweet letter should do.

	Dale Rasmussen

Re-sending.  Hopefully you can print this one.

In connection with the APEA matter, we have been informed that Avista (Avista 
manages Clark County PUD's gas supplies for its facility) has transaction 
tapes related to Clark's declaration of force majeure that may be of 
interest.  

It is possible that we should send a request to Avista to retain the tapes 
for the dates 12-6-00 through today in case a dispute arises over the 
declaration of force majeure.  Do you think that would be prudent, and if so, 
how would you like to go about making the request?

Based on this information, I say don't go. Let me know if anything changes.

The language that Gary Grote proposed for the indemnification provision of 
the consulting agreement is:

5. Indemnification. Company represents and warrants (i) that it is a 
successor corporation to Enron Milford, Inc., (ii) that the Certificate of 
Incorporation (the "Certificate") of Enron Milford, Inc. on file in the 
Division of Corporation Files of the Secretary of State, State of Delaware, 
applies to Company, and (iii) that the Certificate previously supplied to 
Consultant is a true, complete and correct copy of the Certificate.  Company 
hereby agrees to reasonably cooperate with Consultant if Consultant makes a 
claim under any of the provisions of the Certificate.

Gary has also indicated to me that alternatively he would agree to accept 
this language:

5. Indemnification. Company represents and warrants (i) that it is a 
successor corporation to Enron Milford, Inc., (ii) that Company will abide by 
the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation (the"Certificate") of Enron 
Milford, Inc. on file in the Division of Corporation Files of the Secretary 
of State, State of Delaware, and (iii) that the Certificate previously 
supplied to Consultant is a true, complete and correct copy of the 
Certificate.

Cliff, Ileana and I all prefer the second alternative.  Let me know when you 
have had the chance to talk with Mark re this.  Thanks.
 

Any idea who this is?

As you are aware, FERC's chief ALJ is presiding over administrative
proceedings, ordered by FERC, that ostensibly are intended to provide the
Cal. utilities with reasonable forward power supply contracts, but, in fact,
are being used equally to force sellers to the ISO and PX during the 3d and
4th Q 2000 to refund some of their profits from those sales.  The refund
will take the form of deeply discounted forward sales commitments to the
utilities.  The impetus for marketers or independent generators to play ball
is the threat that FERC may revoke their authorization to make power
wholesales at market-based as opposed to regulated cost-based rates or take
some other punitive step.

My concern is that this is a terribly one-sided negotiation.  Marketers and
generators are being asked to put their profits on the table - profits that
FERC's general counsel's office and FERC itself have concluded they have no
power to touch - and proceed to negotiate against themselves.

Enron has good people representing them in these FERC proceedings - Sue
Mara, Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel and, when needed, my colleague Ron
Carroll.  What I am concerned about is that they do not have a concrete
strategy or end game to pursue.  Among other things, Enron 's strategy
should include requiring the utilities, FERC  and the CPUC to put some value
on the table together with the marketers' and generators' profits.  As these
values may implicate strategy in the California civil actions, I thought I
should run my thioughts by you.

Specifically, I think Enron (and its allies) should insist that as
precondition of even considering discounted forward sales:

1.  FERC and the CPUC must commit to file in the District Ct. action
pleadings in support of a motion ito dismiss the complaints on the ground of
exclusive FERC jurisdiciton.

2.  FERC agree to vacate on rehearing as unsupported by substantial evidence
its December 15 finding that rates had been unjust and unreasonable.

3.  The utilities and CPUC commit to auctioning off all or some large
percentage of the utilities' retail customer base.

There may be other quid pro quo considerations.  I think it is imperative
that Enron decide now what they should be.   Politically (and quite likely
commercially) it is not an option for Enron to pull out of the FERC
proceedings.  Therefore, we need to start changing what is at stake in the
FERC proceeding and directing it toward our end game.

Please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.

Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs

That You Were Afraid To Ask

(or Didn't  Know to Ask)

Presented by
David Marshall
Enron Corporate Risk Management

Thursday, January 11, 2001
11:30 - 1:00

The Houston Room
601 Jefferson
(We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the "non-walkers")

Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.

One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of 
departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily 
basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the 
East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to 
have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current 
Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation 
preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to 
all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   

Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the 
quality of the food and the presentation.

As you will note from the attached e-mail, Bernard Glatzer is now pro se. It 
is only a matter of time until the case is over.

I am pleased to report to you that I received a fax on Sunday from Bernard
Glatzer reading as follows:

"Andrew Hayes and Boies, Schiller & Flexner were discharged by me for
obvious cause two and one half weeks ago in the above entitled matters, but
have not yet filed the appropriate withdrawals pursuant to my specific
instructions.  Until further notice please direct all correspondence and
communications to me at 2707 Creston Ave.' #2F, Bronx, New York 10468 or at
(718) 584-3998 (Tel. & Fax)."

Is that great sucking sound Andy Hayes notifying his carrier?

Gentlemen -

We are currently in the processing of serving/delivering the GOM Guarantee 
demand and the PPA Meet and Discuss Letter.  Ken Lay approved the delivery in 
a conference call this morning.  Our attention will then turn to the GOI 
Guarantee demand (can be served a week from today), the Notice of Arbitration 
under the GOM Guarantee and anticipation of injunctive relief being sought by 
our counterparties to stay any arbitration and collection/payment on the 
guarantees.

We are scheduled to meet with the lenders in NY tomorrow.

Bruce Lundstrom

Jim/Mark -

I know that Rob has been keeping you generally apprised, but I thought that I 
would update you both on the quickly evolving Dabhol situation.

The commercial situation at Dahbol Power Company is deteriorating pretty 
rapidly.  MSEB is now approx. 45 days late on payment in full of the October 
invoice.  They have paid only a relatively modest portion of that bill.  
Payment on the November bill is about 15 days late.  The MSEB Chairman says 
that MSEB can't pay these invoices.

At present, the Governments of Maharashtra and India are refusing to engage 
in a constructive dialogue on solving the non-payment issue and the 1400 MW 
that will come on line as part of Phase II.  They say that they recognize 
their obligations as guarantors of MSEB's obligations but are not interested 
in helping in any different capacity (e.g., GOI buys some or all of Phase II).

Until just a few days ago, the lead India bank was refusing to fund even 
their own ongoing interest obligation.  At present, they are refusing to 
continue funding any other Phase II draw request.  The India banks have a 
great deal to lose and, in our opinion, should strongly consider continuing 
to fund Phase II.  It would seem that the lead India bank is scared, knaive 
or, worse yet, very pessimistic about Dabhol's future -- perhaps there are 
other reasons for their current position.

We are meeting with the international banks in NY on Tuesday.  Our main goal 
is to convince them to continue to fund and to use their influence to have 
the India banks do the same.

The current India legal crisis team is nearly identical to the 1995 India 
legal crisis team.  The same law firms and lawyers (both Indian and 
international) are continuing to play much the same roles.

We have not identified any particular "holes" in Dabhol's legal position.  
While the India newspapers have offered up various theories that might allow 
MSEB to cancel the PPA (frustration of purpose, etc.), none seem compelling.  
No counterparty has offered up any of these theories directly to DPC.

In the short term, we are preparing (1) a demand under the GOM guarantee and 
(2) a "meet and discuss" letter under the PPA.  The current plan is to serve 
these next week.  We are also preparing (3) an arbitration notice under the 
GOM guarantee, (4) a demand under the GOI guarantee and (5) an action against 
MERC.  MERC is the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission.  They have 
issued "orders" over the last year limiting the amount of power that MESB 
buys from Dabhol.  We do not believe that they have jurisdiction to do so.  
We may or may not ultimately file this action.

Let me know if I can provide any further information.

Bruce

Here is what I want to do on this. I need to review and approve all bills. I 
do not have to the sign off on the required documentation. If it makes Britt 
more comfortable, fine I'll do it. But I do not need to do so.
Becky Zikes@ENRON

Linda,

Just wanted to follow up regarding signatures on the invoices.  Becky 
Stephens cannot process the invoices without an authorization signature, so 
we need to know how you want to handle this.  Since there were no questions 
noted on the invoices, we have assumed that you found them to be in order.

Please contact me as soon as possible.  I received an email from Holland and 
Hart this morning regarding their invoices and Beatty's office has contacted 
me about their January invoices.

Thanks for your help.

Linda,

Becky Stephens received a stack of invoices for the above cases today that 
appear to be ones you sent to us for processing.   However, they do not have 
approval signatures.  Do either you or Richard want to sign off on them, or 
do you want Britt to do so with your authorization?

Please let me know as soon as possible so we can get them processed.

Thanks,

Becky

Attached is a preliminary agenda for the LeBoeuf meetings this week.  

I would like to propose that we have the LeBoeuf lawyers in the office midday 
Tuesday to meet with us Tuesday afternoon and then as much as Wednesday as 
necessary. I would assume we would want a core group of lawyers to attend all 
or substantially all of the meetings and then we would bring in business 
people as appropriate. I would also try to arrange the schedule to handle EES 
only or EWG only issues  in blocks.

1.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW  ASAP IF THIS SCHEDULE IS A PROBLEM. I know getting on 
everyone's calendar on short notice is a challenge.  Thanks in advance for 
your attention to this matter. 
2.  John, can you highlight for me any areas where you expect business 
participation so we can start arranging our business people's schedules.
3.  EWG - who will take the lead on discussing the commercial agreements?
4.  Let me know if you have additional agenda topics. 
5.  Jim, should we arrange some time on your calendar with the LeBoeuf 
lawyers?

Please get me any suggestions, etc. Monday morning and we will work toward  
developing the final agenda for the meeting. 
Vicki:

Attached is a draft of a proposed agenda for your consideration.  It has more 
things in it than a simple agenda, but I thought it may make some sense to be 
a little more inclusive in the "bullets" to make sure we cover as much as 
possible, from the standpoint of understanding or at least being aware of all 
of the moving parts in CA (CPUC, FERC, court litigations, etc.), while we 
have everyone together at this kick off meeting.  I would view the primary 
purpose of the meeting to obtain as much factual information as possible and 
to provide everyone with a general sense of the types of the considerations 
that would be likely to come up in the bankruptcy context.

I am simultaneously sending this to our bankruptcy folks so I may have some 
additional comments or topics in the morning.  I also will send to you at 
that time a brief memo prepared by our bankruptcy lawyers that goes through 
some of the initial bankruptcy considerations, based upon our conversations 
on Friday.

Please call me when you wish to follow up.

John

Richard-

I just wanted to follow up on my requests attached below.  Additionally, we 
haven't received a response from Gibbs & Bruns.  This isn't a problem right 
now as we are still probably at least a week away from signing an opinion.  I 
just wanted to keep you informed.  Let me know if I can send someone up to 
get copies of the documents.  Thanks for your help.

Richard-

I have two requests that I hope you can help me with.  First, I wanted to see 
if there was an executed document removing Intrust.  If there is, I would 
like to get a copy of that.  Also, you mentioned a "side letter" agreement 
drawn up to allow the GPs to have the right to remove Intrust.  I would also 
like to get a copy of that document.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

This will acknowledge receipt of the above.  This will be handled as an 
insurance-related matter, subject to any objections by our reinsurer, to 
which we would not anticipate.  The allegations give rise to a "products" 
claim, and as such, pollution related exclusionary language would not be 
applicable.  Thus, we will defend the entire lawsuit, and indemnify with the 
exception of any settlement/award for damages associated with the count of 
"FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT" as such constitutes "intentional" conduct as opposed 
to an "accident".  I trust you will advise the operating company accordingly.

Eileen, please advise as to who you suggest we retain in this matter.  
Perhaps other firms have been retained by the other defendants to which we 
could share in a cost-sharing agreement.  Additionally, it is critical for us 
to determine our involvement and any sale dates of product given that the 
lawsuit is silent as to the time period involved here. The involved time 
period will have an impact on how claim payments will be allocated.

Thanks,

Rob

What interest rate are we being charged?

	Britt Davis@ENRON
	01/08/2001 09:55 AM
		 
Bernard,

This will confirm our telephone conference of today and your telefax to me of 
today.  You confirmed that you had not mentioned settlement to Interfert's 
attorneys; I assume that Interfert's attorneys have not raised the subject 
with us either.

You also confirmed that Enron has no obligation to pay anything based simply 
on Mr. Cornuot's final report, which will have to be considered by the Court 
of Appeals of Versailles before it can become legally binding, and that Enron 
would likely have no obligation to pay any additional amounts until 
approximately the middle of 2002.  You advised that the parties' pleadings 
regarding Mr. Cornuot's report were not due to be filed with the Court of 
Appeals of Versailles until October 1, 2001 and that supplemental pleadings 
could be filed until January 17, 2002.  Oral argument (trial) before the 
Court of Appeal of Versailles was set for March 7, 2002.  Based on this, you 
did not expect the Court of Appeal of Versailles to render its decision until 
around June 2002.

You have also inquired with our appellate experts as to when they expect a 
ruling from the Supreme Court of France, and expect a response within the 
next ten (10) days from now.

You will have your legal assistant translate only those portions of Mr. 
Cornuot's final report that differ significantly from his preliminary 
report.   I would also appreciate it if you would send copies of the complete 
report to Christophe Casabonne and Michel Bouthonnet.  

As soon as it becomes practical to do so, I would appreciate inquiry into how 
much Mr. Cornuot will request for his fees and expenses in this matter.

You will also advise me of  (a) your attorney's fees and expenses 
outstanding, for your billed but unpaid time (if any); (b), for your accrued 
but unbilled time and expense; and (c), for your estimated fees and expenses 
going forward, until the exhaustion of all appeals.

Last, you confirmed that you frequently travelled to London and expected to 
be available for a conference in person with Richard in either Paris or 
London, at his convenience, around March 12, when Richard intends to be in 
London on other matters.

Many thanks for your help.

Regards,

Britt

All parties have agreed to extend discovery cut off from 1/19 to 3/5/01, but
only for depositions of scheduled persons.  The "protected" list includes
Brian Barth, the person most knowledgable from ECT Securities, Julien Smythe,
and the person most knowledgable from Akin, Gump.  The list does not include
Kevin McConville.  I assume that ECT will designate Barth as PMK and that Akin
Gump will designate Smythe as PMK, so that we are talking about only two
depositions.

Trial dates and dispositive motion deadlines have not changed.

As a result of the the limited extension of discovery cutoff, plaintiffs want
to push Brian back to the week of January 29th or the week of February 5th. 
They are also making noise about Brian's deposition possibly taking four days.
 We may want to take the position that Brian will be there for three days and
no more.  That will ruffle a lot of feathers, and you and I should discuss it.

Hennegan has asked if I will represent Akin Gump and, if so, will I accept
service.  You and I should discuss this also.  Either way, we need to alert
Akin Gump what is going on.

Vicky,
I am a Managing Partner of a search firm that works with EES, but we have
not previously worked with the legal group.  I spoke to Mike Smith earlier
today about a candidate.  He thought there were probably no needs due to a
recent hiring binge, but suggested that I send this candidate to you to
cover our bases.  Craig is a very bright individual that has a heightened
interest in EES.  If you feel he can add value or solve a particular
business need please correspond through return of this email or reach by
phone at 816-524-4696.

Thank You,

Some weeks ago, Richard sent me copies of some demand letters dated in 
November to the "ENA Legal Department" that he suspected had been laying 
around somewhere, and asked me to investigate.  I have had one meeting with 
Enron's mailroom people, who I gave my only copies of those letters.  They 
threw them away, thinking I had finished my investigation.  I have mentioned 
this to Richard and asked him to send me additional copies, but it may have 
slipped his mind.  Can you help me?

One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in 
a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG 
contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million. As you will recall, this 
representation was the reason that we did not meet with O'Melveny when we 
were in CA last month.

Jim - Happy New Year!  While I am no longer on the legal side of the fence, I 
want to pass on to you my strong recommendation for you to consider using 
O'Melveny & Myers, in particular for California litigation,  but perhaps in 
other areas.  Over the past 2 years, we used O'Melveny in connection with the 
wind cos dispute with Florida Power & Light, and they did a great job.  
O'Melveny is one of the 2 or 3 largest firms in California and probably one 
of its oldest and finest.  One of their litigation partners (and good 
personal friend of mine) is named Brian Curry, and if you have any interest 
in meeting these guys, they would very much like the chance to meet you.  
Please let me know if there might be any interest.  I hope all is well with 
you and your family.  Best regards. Adam 

As you will note from the attached e-mail, the Quinque class action has been 
remanded to state district court in Hugoton Kansas. Robin Gibbs had always 
predicted that this was the likely result. We will now proceed with the 
battle over class certification in Kansas, which,unlike Texas, is not 
necessarily appealable. I will keep you posted..

Andy is calling now, but for those of you he does reach immediately, here is
a short report based on a conversation that he had with Mike Beatty.

Judge Downes granted the motion to remand.  A short written order will be
out later today or Monday.

He apparently read from a draft of the order, and Mike Beatty says that it
was written in high level generalities about presumptions in favor of
remand, burden to establish removal jurisdiction, etc. and did not address
the details of our federal jurisdiction (e.g., OCSLA) arguments.  More later
today.

at 2 p.m. Central.  Dial-in instructions are as follows:

Dial-in:  800-403-1026
Participant code:  305486

              2.   Kansas counsel will confer with committee on
scheduling issues on Monday to discuss approaches to court or
plaintiffs' counsel on schedule issues, such as new common answer/motion
date and discovery deadlines or stay.  Participants will receive
separate dial-in instructions.  This group will report to JDT at large
in Wednesday call.
               3.  Kansas motion committees will confer on Tuesday to
review status of dismissal motions on personal jurisdiction and
non-personal jurisdiction grounds.   Participants will receive separate
announcement of call and dial-in instructions.  This group will also
report to JDT at large in Wednesday call.
              4.   Preliminary research shows any rehearing application
needs to be on file before Judge mails order to remand case.  Judge
intends to mail order on Tuesday, January 16th.  (Law appears split on
whether rehearing can be entertained at all, but is clear any
application must be in before mailing).

wanted to talk with you regarding the facts of this case as well as obtain
Mr. Todaro's information so that I can contact him.  Please give me a call
at your earliest convenience.  My number is (713) 758-4634.  Thank you.

I received another fax from, and then a telephone call from, Bernard Glatzer
today.  JJR was with me for the call (I felt that he deserved it).

What a bizarre man  The fax, which I will send you,
says to me (and Jerry Pecht, the lawyer for Bear Stearns) that "the
defendants and/or their attorneys breached the settlement agreement with me
in Glatzer vs. Bear Stearns, with whose confidential details Enron is fully
familiar."

I have no idea what this means, or is intended to convey.

Glatzer called and left word for me to call him back; I did.  He told JJR
and I that he was interested in settling his case against Enron.  I told him
that I would pass that on to Enron, but that my sense was that Enron thought
it had already won the case.  Glatzer said that, no, there were still things
he was planning to file, do, etc. and that it might be better for Enron to
settle with him now "before new lawyers come into the case."

I am sure lawyers are just lining up to take this one for him.

I told him that I could either pass on his comments to Enron, or he could
fax me a specific settlement demand.  He said he would do the latter,
sometime next week.

I have omitted all of the truly bizarre aspects of the conversation.  He did
giggle a lot, talk about President Bush's transition team, and ask me
whether I minded if he and I had a social conversation.

I will send you a copy of whatever I receive from him.

Yes I have.  He's a very nice guy who is anxious to see his daughter.  I've
tried to contact Michael Coury but he has not called me back yet.  I have
tried him again today.  Hopefully he has seen the light since you talked
with him last.  Felix told me his story and from his perspective, there
doesn't seem to be anything that would allow the grandparents to maintain
custody of Alexis.  I'm going to work through HVLP to hopefully resolve this
matter in the Texas court.  I will be happy to keep you updated with my
progress.

Have you talked to Felix?

Just got this yesterday at 5.  I am passing it on to you and some others.
As you can see, this is just an indication of level of interest, and not a
commitment at this time. The prospectuses should be printed in the next week
or so, and I will forward one to you.  In the mean time, let me know kind of
your level of interest and I will get your name on the list.  Call or email

In conjunction with the pending IPO, Encore will be offering a Directed
Share Program, also known as a "Friends and Family Program".  The program
allows specified friends, family, and business connections to participate in
Encore's offering at the time of the IPO.  The program will be facilitated
through Credit Suisse First Boston.

My contacts at Credit Suisse have asked that we assemble a list of those
people that we wish to include in the program as soon as possible.  They
will need names, addresses, and phone numbers of the proposed participants,
as well as the desired number of shares, if known.  A minimum allocation of
100 shares per participant is required.  Please think of who you would like
to include in the program, and send me your initial list by noon tomorrow
(Thursday, January 11).  I realize that this is short notice, but not to
worry; the list can be continually updated and edited as we approach the IPO
date.  Please send all list revisions to me as soon as they are available.

Richard asked me to send you this letter for Dave Delainey.

He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that 
case. He never told me that he would be filing anything. In fact, he asked me 
to write a letter outlining Felix's parental attributes because they were 
still looking at what to do.

	"Elmore, Benjamin" <belmore@velaw.com>
	01/16/2001 05:03 PM
		 
I just spoke with Koury and he was anything but reasonable.  He has already
filed an application in the Iowa courts for guardianship and conservatorhip
of Alexis, even though the Iowa Code gives parental preference, which is a
difficult preference to overcome.  Also, the Iowa court doesn't have
jurisdiction until Texas says it does.  He said he told you about some case
he took to the Iowa Supreme Court where the Court granted a grandfather
possession and conservatorship over the father who was an out of state
resident.  Do you remember that?

Limor and Richard,

I would like to recommend that we use Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn & Stifel as 
our local counsel in Honolulu, the port where the M/V OBOD, and her cargo, 
are under arrest.  Although I do not have any personal experience with this 
law firm, I got their name from local admiralty attorneys who have access to 
the books published by the various P&I Clubs, which list what maritime 
attorneys each club has certified for use in each port.  The Goodsill, 
Anderson firm was mentioned by two different admiralty attorneys here in 
Houston as being listed by a number of different clubs for the port of 
Honolulu.  It is not at all unusual for admiralty attorneys to choose local 
counsel in this manner.

I have not yet received Goodsill, Anderson's proposed engagement letter, but 
will send it to you when I do.

I will call each of you tomorrow to get your thoughts on this firm.

Britt

Dear  Britt:
?
Per your  request, I am forwarding you copies of our firm's resume and 
billing  policies.? I am also forwarding personal resumes for two of my 
partners,  John Lacy and Mark Desmarais, both of whom do maritime work.? For 
reasons  discussed hereinbelow, I suggest that Mark and his associate, Randy 
Baldemor,  would be best suited to work on this matter.? The billing rates 
for Mark  and Randy are $245/hour and?$130/hour, respectively.
?
Two issues  turned up during our conflict check.? First, our firm represents 
Hawaiian  Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) and its subsidiaries, including its 
three public  utility subsidiaries, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), 
Hawaii Electric  Light Company, Inc. (HELCO) and Maui Electric Company, 
Limited (MECO).?  Although we are not aware on any actual conflict between 
ENRON and HEI, HECO,  HELCO or MECO, we are cognizant that ENRON is a major 
player in the power  producing industry.? Accordingly, we would need to 
confirm that our  representation of ENRON in the present maritime matter 
would not preclude us  from representing HEI, HECO, HELCO or MECO in other 
matters in which such  companies' interests may be adverse to ENRON.? Please 
let me know as soon  as possible whether this arrangement is acceptable.
?
Second, as it  turns out, Mark Desmarais and Randy Baldemor having been 
tracking the M/V OBOD  and reporting back to a Seattle Washington law firm.? 
The Seattle firm  retained our firm strictly to monitor the vessel and any 
actions with regard to  her arrest, but has neither asked for legal advice, 
nor disclosed who their  client is.? Mark does not believe that our firm's 
monitoring the status of  the vessel presents any conflicts with our 
representing ENRON.? He has  placed a call to the Seattle firm and expects?to 
hear back from his contact  later this afternoon.? Assuming our firm is 
engaged by ENRON, given that  they already know about the vessel, its recent 
history and the parties and  counsel involved, Mark and Randy would appear 
best suited to assist you on this  matter.
?
Finally, I  passed on to Mark your immediate concern that ENRON should not be 
viewed  (because it missed a filing deadline or otherwise) as having 
abandoned its  interest in the cargo of the M/V OBOD.? Mark checked (on the 
premise that  our firm was being considered to be retained as Hawaii counsel) 
with Bryan Ho,  attorney for Nordic Technical Development, Inc., who 
indicated that he was not  aware of any passed or pending filing deadlines.
?
I will call you  tomorrow morning, Hawaii time, to discuss the two issues 
that came out of our  conflict check.? I look forward to resolving these 
issues to our mutual  benefit and to assisting ENRON on this matter.
?
Best  regards.

Jay,

As I mentioned, I had met with Richard Sanders and Andy Edison earlier today, 
and they recommend that we respond to Ron's latest letter.  Richard tells me 
that, in litigation, much is made of the fact that a party did not respond to 
another's correspondence.  As you can see, I have kept the response short 
rather than rehash and contradict once more each of Ron's numerous 
inaccuracies and self-serving statements.

Thanks for the notice.  I believe this case belongs to another Enron
affiliate and they are likely aware of it.  Just in case, I am forwarding
this message to our Houston headquarters for their handling.  Please do not
engage in any activity on this matter.  The selection of counsel will be
controlled by the business unit attorney responsible for that affiliate.
Thanks for your awareness of this filing.

indicating new superior court filings. Padre Dam Municipal Water District,
Valley Municipal Water District and the Sweetwater Authority filed suit
against Enron and others for "antitrust/unfair business practices" on
January 16, 2001. I will get a copy of the complaint so you can call me

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Peter.

Dear Doug,

I decided to wait until after Christmas to respond to your letter.

I have drafted an amended petition which adds Randy, Steve, and Enron as
defendants.  Among other matters, the petition includes tort claims arising
from acts of slander, fraud, and tortious interference with contract.

You have been critical of my decision to file the original petition in
September because, as I understand it, you believed that I had failed to
exhaust other avenues for redress.  I believe that every other potential
means of resolution had been exhausted.  However, in respect for your offer
of constructive criticism, I would like to once again extend an offer for
mediation in an attempt to resolve the ECOGAS matter, and now these matters.

I called your office and understand that you are not in today.  As I
anticipate that you may be on vacation this week, I will wait until next
week before proceeding with any new filings.

Please contact me if mediation is of any interest to your client.  If it
won't be you, please let me know if you happen to know who will be
representing the additional defendants.

Best regards,
Tom

Thanks for the notice.  I believe this case belongs to another Enron

this message to our Houston headquarters for their handling.  Please do not
engage in any activity on this matter.  The selection of counsel will be
controlled by the business unit attorney responsible for that affiliate.
Thanks for your awareness of this filing.

He assures me that the matter does not involve an Enron entity.  Accordingly,

you would recommend at V&E, Bracewell Patterson, Andrews & Kurth or otherwise?

Hi Mary - Do you know where we stand on the release of the orginal lawsuits 
that were filed against ECT Securities and the other underwriters regarding 
NSM?  We put out a Watch Report for Merchant assets and I've sort of referred 
to that issue with a generic comment like  "Negotiations continue regarding 
obtaining releases from the lawsuits that were filed against the original 
underwriting group that included ECT Securities."

If memory serves me correctly, there was one release that was granted - 
either from Farrallon Capital Mgmt, or Oaktree?  Do you know how many others 
are outstanding.

Please let me know at your convenience.

In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court 
in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the 
rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its 
undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court 
agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass 
through the power purchase costs to customers.)

The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but 
said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to 
us to make a copy for ourselves.

Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the 
courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have 
that filing passed around to this distribution list.

Best,
Jeff

	"Fergus, Gary S." <GFergus@brobeck.com>
	02/01/2001 02:15 PM
		 
Richard,
 Here is my quick reaction to the idea of Enron terminating its PX
participation agreement in the Core Market:

 1. PX tariff 18.3 says that a participation agreement "may be
terminated by either party upon written notice."

 2. PX tariff 5.3 says with respect to the Core Market
Proportional Charge-Back Methodology:

  "The PX Participant's outstanding default amount will be
charged back to all current PX Participants based upon the percentage of its
gross sales in MWHs to the Total gross MWHs sales in the Core Market during
the three calendar months preceding the event plus the current month to
date."

  3. PX Participant is a defined term:

  "An entity that is authorized to buy or sell Energy or
Ancillary Services through the PX, and any agent authorized to act on behalf
of such entity."

  4. Energy is also a defined term:

  "The electrical energy produced, flowing or supplied by
generation, transmission or distribution facilities, being the integral with
respect to time of the instantaneous power, measured in units of watt-hours
or standard multiples thereof, e.g. 1000 Wh.

  5. Ancillary services is also a defined term:

  "Regulation, Spinning Reserve, Non-Spinning Reserve,
Replacement Reserve, Voltage Support and Black start together with such
other interconnected operation services as the ISO may develop in
cooperation with Market Participants to support the transmission of Energy
from Generation resources to Loads while maintaining reliable operation of
the ISO controlled grid in accordance with good utility practice."

  Bottom line:

  If a PX Participant, as defined in the PX tariff as opposed
to the PX rate schedule for the CTS market, is an entity that is authorized
to buy or sell "instantaneous power" rather than power in the future, then
Enron by withdrawing from its PX participation agreement would no longer be
a current PX participant.  Thus, there is an argument that by withdrawing in
writing prior to any chargeback in the core market, that Enron may be able
to argue it cannot be charged back.

  I also looked at the ADR and dispute resolution procedures
to see if Enron had to be PX Participant to initiate the procedure and
maintain it.  Schedule 9 section 1.1 states that PX ADR procedures shall
apply to all disputes between parties which arise under PX Documents.
Section 2.1 states that the "PX and PX Participants shall negotiate in good
faith..." It goes on to state in Section 2.2 that "any one of the parties"
may submit a statement of claim.  Thereafter, in Schedule 9 it appears that
the references are to parties not PX Participants.  My quick reading is that
you still have to use and get the benefits of the ADR even if you are no
longer a PX Participant.

  Operational Downside:

  Does Enron have to be a PX Participant to get the PX to
schedule the power that Enron has sold in the CTS market as it becomes due?
In other words, if Enron is not a PX Participant, does that mean the PX will
not schedule the power leading to an Enron default under its obligations to
the PX to deliver power?  Could that lead to the underscheduling penalty if
PX  balances its schedule without Enron's power?  I do not know the answer
to this but I am reviewing the tariff.

  Hope this helps
  Thanks

Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation

Here is the list of counsel that attended today's conference call regarding
public events involving the California Power Exchange Corporation.  I
delayed publishing this list until 6:00 p.m. because I kept receiving emails
from interested parties.  I also received the following report from John
Stamper at O'Melveny & Myers who represents SEMPRA and San Diego Gas &
Electric.

John had a conversation with Bob Moore from Millbank representing the
California PX.  Bob apparently told John that invoices for the chargebacks
will be issued on Monday February 5th and will be due and payable by
Thursday February 8th or Friday February 9th.  John asked for February 9th
rather than the 8th.  John raised again the possibility of a standstill
agreement.  Bob Moore reported that the CalPX was amenable to a standstill
agreement if everybody agreed.  They are worried, however, about being sued
for failing to liquidate collateral as soon as they are able etc.  John
pointed out that the CalPX might be subject to claims from those entities
that had their letters of credit drawn down improperly.  Bob then reported
that the number one option that the  CalPX was considering was bankruptcy.
It seems to them to be the one forum where they can get all the parties.
They are also considering dissolution and invoking the ADR procedure
themselves.

We have scheduled a teleconference to discuss the FERC options for 11:00
a.m. PST on Monday February 5, 2001.  The call in number is 1-800-205-3434,
participant code: 653687

I have also received a request to schedule an alternative teleconference for
1:00 p.m. PST to consider non-FERC alternatives.  This would include
litigation alternatives.  We will distribute the dial in number and access
code for that call on Monday morning.

Proposed Agenda for 11:00 a.m. FERC Option Teleconference:

I. Current Status of any proposed filings.
 Note:  Phil Fantle, in-house counsel for Cargill-Alliant sent me a
copy of a filing they made  with FERC on January 29th.  I will send a
copy under separate email cover.
II. Discussion of specific relevant examples where CalPX has violated
the tariff with respect to  specific PX Participants.  The purpose of
gathering these examples is to be able to  demonstrate that CalPX is
acting arbitrarily and capriciously if that is case.  This could
include identification of specific instances of inconsistent treatment of PX
Participants or  inconsistent treatment of the same PX Participant.

 For example, Phil Fantle pointed out that the way he reads the
tariff, if you look at the  chargeback formula set forth in Schedule 2,
Section 5.3, the ratio for each PX Participant  appears to be a fixed number
that  does not vary after the default of another PX Participant.     In
Phil's example, if a defaulting participant has a 25% share of the gross
MWHs sold in the Core market, during the chargeback process only 75%
of the default is paid through  chargeback because there is no provision for
recalculating the chargeback formula.

III. Summary of best arguments of why CalPX application of charge-back is
inconsistent with  tariff.
IV. Impact of Governor Davis' "commandeering" of SCE block forward
contracts.

I have been buried with your state's energy crisis and have not had a chance 
to look at it. I would like to go to dinner on the 7th. Do you want to meet 
w/ McConville while you are here ?

Richard - Do you have any comments on the draft engagement letter that I 
faxed to you
last week?

A reminder that Roland and I are currently scheduled to have dinner with Brian
Barth on the evening of 2/7 and to meet with him all day on 2/8.  (there is
some possibility that we may ask Brian to roll this schedule one day, since I
may still be in SF in the deposition of Bill Mellin of Farallon thru 2/7
althought I am hoping to get out of SF at the end of the day on 2/6.)

Do you want to be involved in our meetings with Brian?

I want to get involved in this.  Michelle will bring me up-to-date.  I don't 
understand why we are considering Brazilian court versus ICC arbitration.

Michelle Blaine
02/01/2001 07:36 PM
1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) 
reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's 
letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to 
sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There 
are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows 
whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it 
is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask 
our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.  
Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, 
Electronorte. 

2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the 
ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, 
Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political 
avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, 
however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek 
assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political 
battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to 
seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to 
progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has 
expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong 
message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we 
proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 
of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at 
the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little 
time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate 
proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what 
reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure 
how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the 
commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure 
what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may 
affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look 
at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or 
express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would 
advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with 
respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand 
every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix 
developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own 
way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have 
traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who 
represents them. 

3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE 
does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the 
contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm 
told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that 
we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine 
Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our 
force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our 
position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both 
parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.  
I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.

4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration 
concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what 
it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. 
Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to 
consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of 
proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a 
number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It 
needs to be subject to review as we go along.

5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going 
to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and 
get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best 
advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the 
Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so 
I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in 
the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position 
that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows.
Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. 
John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I 
may be unaware of with any strategic plan.
Regards,
Michelle

It should. I am not sure what game they are playing. Maybe it allows them to 
argue their block forward positions should not be liquidated because PG&E is 
not in default to the PX.

letter from pg&e to the iso.  shouldn't this letter go to the px who in turn 
would send it to the iso?

  ISO Market Participants:
  On January 31, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received
by fax a letter from Joseph C. Henri, Director of Utility Electric Portfolio
Management at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E). Mr. Henri stated that
PG&E was providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO
Tariff that "Uncontrollable Forces prevent PG&E from performing all of its
obligations under the ISO Tariff."  Mr. Henri's letter identified
"government regulations and market conditions" as "forces beyond PG&E's
reasonable control."  In addition, Mr. Henri stated that the temporary
electric rate increase ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission
on January 4, 2001 was "an amount far below that necessary to enable PG&E to
generate sufficient cash to pay its ongoing procurement bills."
  Mr. Henri continued by stating that "PG&E...lacks the funds
to pay in full its bill from the Independent System Operator for November
power purchases, due on February 1, 2001."   Further, Mr. Henri stated that
"because PG&E's inability to make full payment is due to Uncontrollable
Forces, the ISO Tariff precludes the Independent Service (sic.) Operator
from imposing any sanctions against PG&E."
  Mr. Henri concluded by stating that PG&E's efforts to secure
relief from these circumstances continue and that PG&E will inform the ISO
as soon as it is able to resume making full payment for its wholesale power
purchases.
  At present, the California ISO neither accepts nor rejects
the claims made in Mr. Henri's letter. The purpose of this market notice is
to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against
PG&E based on PG&E's failure to pay in full ISO invoices.

Andy,

This is basically a collection action for about $1,800,000 of unpaid spot gas 
sales against Triad, a very small company whose address (or at least one 
address) is in Columbus, Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began around 
February of 2000.  All the deals were made over the phone by the trader, and 
then confirmed with ENA's spot gas sales forms ("confirms").  Per ENA's usual 
custom and practice, neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms, although 
there are signature lines.  ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these 
deals.  Triad paid off some other deals, but has since stopped sending us any 
money.  I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 
2000.  Triad's principal, Sherwood Purnell, has apparently admitted in a 
recorded telephone conference that he would pay us.  Our information is that 
Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else.

Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms, we have sent an 
arbitration demand to Triad.  Triad did not respond.  The AAA has sent out a 
list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 
7.  I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an 
extension for Purnell, and left a message that I want to discuss the case.  
This was on Monday.  I have also had  Becky, my legal assistant, call up 
Triad's registered agent for service of process, although the Maryland 
secretary of state's office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing.  
The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told 
Becky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b) 
he was "aware of us".  This leads me to believe that the address that we have 
been using is a good address.  We did get someone to sign for documents that 
we sent to that address.  

What I don't want to do, however,  is go all the way through arbitration, get 
a default judgment, then, when we try to enforce it, have Triad complain that 
we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address.

My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which to 
send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any 
other address that looks viable, by Federal Express or certified mail, so 
that we get a receipt.  So long as we get the registered agent to sign for 
these things, I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triad 
an extension of time to answer also makes us look good. 

Parenthetically, unfortunately, given Triad's attitude, I think it likely 
that after we get an arbitration award, Triad will choose not to abide by it 
until, at a minimum, we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award 
enforced.  I don't see a way around that problem.

Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time.

Britt

Thanks.

Richard,
 Here is the status of the information we have about the City of Palo
Alto's request that our firm represent them in connection with the potential
bankruptcy of PG&E.  It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto has
agreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adverse
in any proceeding, then agree that our firm will have to withdraw from
representation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continue
to represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided to
our firm confidential information.  In particular, if Enron and the City of
Palo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricity
litigation  (including class actions, governmental investigations and the
recent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG&E
for physical delivery), our firm will be able to continue to represent Enron
even against the City of Palo Alto. One of the reasons that the City of Palo
Alto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likely
they will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specialized
expertise of Larry Engel.  The City of Palo Alto has its own generation
capacity through WAPA (the Western Area Power Administration), NCPA (the
Northern California Power Agency), and TANC (the Transmission Authority of
Northern California).  The City does buy a small amount of power from Enron,
as I understand it.  We have specifically identified the City and County of
San Francisco suit and asked if Palo Alto has any intention of joining that
suit.

 Would you please let us know Enron's view of this proposed
bankruptcy representation in view of these disclosures?

Thanks
Gary

I am reviewing a contract for testing turbines with a small municipality in 
Florida, under which the muni would allow us to periodically test turbines at 
its facilities.  They want Florida law to govern, and I don't anticipate that 
they will move on this.  They also want Palm Beach County as the venue for 
arbitration.  I am going to push for a large city to ensure a decent pool of 
arbitrators.  What is your view of Miami as the venue for arbitration?

I believe I had sent to you a reply earlier this month to your memo to me 
regarding how to allocate the outstanding inovice to cost centers (e.g., mine 
or Richard's). In my reply, I indicated that I thought that since all of the 
work done by Watson Farley in the attached invoice was in anticipation of an 
arbitration, the bill should be paid from the litigation RC. If you would 
like to discuss, please let me know.

Please confirm that the invoice has been or will be paid soon. Thanks for

Would appreciate if you could help with the processing of WFW's bill. The 
bill is not small, but not unexpected. I've spent quite a lot of time 
reviewing it with Neale and already expended quite a bit of goodwill between 
us to get the bill reduced. We shouldn't delay payment further.

Thanks for your help.

I have sat with Neale Gregson to review WFW's bill and confirmed that it does 
not include independent FGH work. Although I have found the bill in order, I 
negotiated for WFW to reduce the bill by S$5,000 based on Enron Singapore's 
goodwill with WFW. 

Regards
Matt

Matt,

This will follow up on my recent e-mail regarding the substantial initial 
bill from WFW.  Given my statement to Richard that I thought a substantial 
portion of that bill related to resolving the FGH issue, Richard has asked me 
to review and apportion that  bill between his R/C and Alan's R/C.  Subject 
to Richard and Alan's thoughts, however, I wonder if it makes more sense to 
ask Neale Gregson to do that for us, given that he was the one that spent the 
time.

I await your response.

I shall be forwarding WFW's bill (which includes PacMarine's bill) to Houston 
(for Joya Davis' attention) for payment of a reduced sum (SGD112,000 for 
WFW's legal fees). A credit note will be issued to us upon payment.

Britt - I don't have any comments on Clyde & Co's bill. If you are OK with 
it, I'll similarly forward thier bill to Joya to process payment. Please let 
me know.

Thanks and regards
Matt

 

Matthias Lee
10/31/2000 05:51 PM
Further to my earlier note, the rest of WFW's bill is for PacMarine's costs 
(SGD18,827.35 reduced from an earlier SGD25,000) which I also think is fair 
and reasonable.

Regards
Matt

I met with Neale Gregson this afternoon to discuss WFW's bill. We went 
through the bill item by item and I am satisfied that it is fair given the 
amount of work actually done. It is nevertheless  a hefty bill, so I did ask 
Neale for some accomodation. He has agreed to reduce the charges from 
SGD120,000 to SGD112,000. I should be xpecting a credit note from WFW. I 
trust this is acceptable to you as well. Please let me know.

Matt

Richard: 

Please see the attached draft letter to Mike Swartz.? Give us your thoughts. 

Some background:? When Roland told Mike Swartz that we were not going to turn 
cartwheels to produce Enron witnesses to, effectively, Farallon's counsel, he 
got quite huffy.? Shortly after that, I received a call from Oaktree's 
General Counsel reminding me of Enron's responsibilities under the Release.? 
You may get a call also, from either Ken Liang or Brian Berman.

In the meantime, as you will see from the attached draft, we have discovered 
that the Release it clearly provides that Oaktree will not disclose anything 
it learns from Enron to it co-plaintiff Farallon.? Given that, how can 
Hennegan interview Brian--is he promising not to tell his client Farallon 
what he learns on behalf of his client Oaktree?? I think we are on good 
grounds, but we definitely should talk about this.

Steve?

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Jim (and Richard) my apologies.  In the pace of the year-end I forgot to 
inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.  The 
litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny 
for Canadian Enerdata.

It is somewhat complicated.  In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas 
trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron 
Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas 
indices for our market.  Traditionally the indices were based upon a 
comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad 
market.  Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two 
days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to 
Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for 
the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.  The result is 
the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and 
therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and 
thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent 
only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility 
and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability 
to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or 
electronic failure. [ex.  We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody 
bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke 
can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of 
contracts to buy and sell Coke.]

In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to 
commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, 
interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, 
civil conspiracy and passing off.  All are viable claims but difficult to 
prove.  We have to get past simply being outsmarted.  We have also decided 
not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.  The discovery process 
will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all 
electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The 
lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and 
damages of C$100MM.  We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as 
usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get 
involved.  Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the 
rest of the market.

In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake 
Cassels & Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was 
conflicted after the injunction papers were served.  We had to find 
replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes 
but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of 
Macleod Dixon.

My apologies for not letting you know sooner.  I had discussed the matter 
with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and 
Richard a line, but I simply forgot.  If you have any questions or concerns, 
please call at 403.974.6923.  If I don't hear from you, all the best for the 
holidays.

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Here is a summary of recent developments:

Another Class Action Natural Gas Complaint Against El Paso and others (Los
Angeles)
 Berg v. Southern California Gas Company. Class action anti-trust and
unfair competition.   This is a conspiracy case alleging that the Southern
California Gas, SDGE and El Paso  conspired not to compete in the
delivery of natural gas in Southern California.  The  complaint alleges
that the conspiracy resulted in discouraging new power plants and drove
up the cost of electricity by controlling the supply of gas.

Copy of Rojoin Electricity Complaint
 I do not believe I include a copy of this complaint before.  It is a
class action involving the retail electrical market.

California AG Investigation
 Here is a copy of my email to the California AG describing our
agreement re preservation of data:
Rich,
 As promised, here is my summary outline of what we discussed
regarding preservation of data:

1. In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the
topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete
any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that is personal and does
not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept, discarded
etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a backup made that will
capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After 24 hours, each
employee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to the
business needs (e.g. keep, discard).  From our conversation, I understand
that you agree that this is an acceptable procedure.

2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would
like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to
discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest
Drive Image Pro 4.0.  In addition, there may be some other individuals that
you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to copy
files from their hard drives onto the network.  Until we figure out which
computers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.  We discussed that
because of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this started
until after the new year.

3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along
business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of your
request.  We propose not to backup any other business units or functions.
On a going forward basis, those business functions that related to the
subject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete business
email.

4. We believe that relevant database  backups have been and will
continue to be made and preserved.

5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it
is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the network
(where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files to make
sufficient work space for the employee to work.

6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do
not have as detailed information immediately available.

As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being made
are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron entities may
have to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction, relevance,
privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically reserves each and
every right and objection it or its employees may have.

Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is
different than the above.
CPUC Subpoena
 Jeff Richter and Tim Belden have been working on getting the EPMI
data correctly gathered.  They hope that by the middle of next week the
Enron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and have
assembled it for production.  Because Jeff Richter will be gone until after
the New Year, we will not be producing any data to the CPUC until early next
year.
 Jeff and Tim are focused on having a common set of reliable data
that will be used for all subpoenas, discovery requests etc.  We also
discussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts to
help with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records for
which we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time.  In other
words, since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in Portland any
analytical work that Tim or Jeff do for us will be recorded on the backup
tapes.
Tim Belden
 FYI Tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due date
of December 25th.  He will become out of pocket for a short time thereafter.
FERC Reporting
 A question arose regarding whether Enron needed to file a report to
FERC concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps.  This was a
requirement that was requested by the ISO in an emergency application on
December 8th.  The order granting the relief did not seem to include the
reporting requirement.  The first cut at the data for the report showed that
Enron made $1.0M over a weekend by buying power at $500 and selling at $700.
A later cut at the data came up with a different answer.  When consulted by
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall, I made the unilateral decision not to file
the report.  It was unclear whether we needed to do so and I had not seen
and did not trust the data.  Later Dan Watkiss confirmed that he believed we
did not need to file the report.  However, beginning January 12th this
report will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap.  Since this report
requires a breakdown of costs vs. sales price, it is the same data that the
PUC has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in the
litigation.  Tim Belden and Jeff Richter are working on a standard reporting
method.
Hiring of Chief Operating Officer for ISO
 Tim Belden has been approached by the current Chief Operating
officer of the ISO requesting a job.  Apparently the COO and the current ISO
board are not getting along.  The issue raised by Tim to Mark Haedicke and
Richard was whether they saw a problem with this hire.  One of the key
issues would be what was the business purpose for the hire.  Obviously,
Enron does not want confidential ISO information from this person.  Also, if
this person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if his
testimony would be favorable to Enron it would be viewed as purchased.  On
the other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he was
employed by Enron that could be harmful.  There is also the question raised
whether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motives
could be in play.  Tim will be meeting with the COO on Friday.  He has
instructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data and
that no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation team.
Potential for Criminal Investigation
 The news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raised
questions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk of
personal liability for them (civil or criminal).  I reported that all we
know is that there is an investigation under way by the California Attorney
General.  We have no reason to believe right now that they are focused on
Enron or that Enron or any employee is a target.  I said that at this stage
of the investigation (including our investigation) we do not know enough
facts to evaluate the risk for individual employees.  We have not reviewed
the trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes.  If we learn of
facts that are specific to an employee, Mark has asked that we notify him
immediately.  We did provide some of this same information to traders we
interviewed early in the process.
Analysis of EPMI data
 I have taken a look at the deviation of the ISO energy flow on a
daily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations to
EPMI's.  The source of the data is public information that was available to
decision makers at the time.  The comparison shows that generally speaking
the ISO was short in its projection by a magnitude of 5-10 times the amount
that EPMI was out of balance.  There are some exceptions, but those are
rare.
Approaching Federal Judge for More Time
 Dave Noonan has pointed out that we should look carefully at the
assigned federal judge and decide who from the defense group locally in San
Diego would be in the best position to make the motion.
Holiday Contact List
 Dave Noonan suggested and I concurred that it makes sense for all of
you who receive this report to email me with your contact information and
schedule over the holiday period.  I will have a composite list made up and
distributed.

Thanks
Gary

Governor Davis Blocks Liquidation of Edison Contracts

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT: E. Jesus Arredondo
Friday, February 02, 2001
626.537.3155

Beth Pendexter

626.537.3154

Pasadena, CA- California Governor Gray Davis issued a last minute Executive
Order prohibiting the California Power Exchange from liquidating Southern
California Edison's forward positions.  The liquidation proceeding is an
attempt to recover approximately $250 million Edison is in default on to
CalPX market participants.

Davis' Executive Order nullifies a Los Angeles County Superior Court
decision that earlier today authorized CalPX to liquidate Edison's forward
market positions. The following is excerpt from Governor Davis' Executive
Order:

 It is ordered that the contracts and trades in the market for the
sales and purchases of forward contracts and trades for electricity (known
as the "Block Forward" market) for the delivery of electricity possessed by
Southern California Edison Company*is hereby commandeered by the State of
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State
of California.

CalPX will transfer the Edison contracts to the State of California. State
law requires that the state shall pay "the reasonable value thereof," and
based on competitive market conditions today, CalPX determined the value of
these contracts, for 2,846,000 megawatt hours, at over $651 million.

- 30 -

CalPX is a non-profit public benefit corporation established in 1998 with
the passage of AB1890, which restructured the electric utility industry
within the state of California.

I still don't know of any bad faith claims

	Michelle Blaine@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	02/06/2001 04:27 PM
		 
In the international arbitration between United India and DPC, United India 
seeks to have the parties realigned and force DPC to be the claimant, even 
though United India invoked arbitration.  We'd rather United India remain the 
claimant because we think they will have a difficult time carrying their 
burden. We are fighting this issue in the first hearing to be held before the 
arbitrators in London on Feb.15.  One of the bases on which United India 
relies, albeit weak, is that it commenced arbitration to avoid a suit in 
Texas courts, and that in consulting Texas lawyers, they learned 
"coincidentally" that these lawyers were "defending 3 sets of  bad faith 
proceedings brought by Enron in the face of binding arbitration 
agreements."   That was in November  2000.  I've called everyone I think 
would know, and as far as I can tell,  this is not true.  We are about to 
file an affidavit stating so in the case.  Please confirm (again if I have 
already contacted you) that you know of no bad faith claims of any kind  (not 
necessarily just in the insurance context) brought by Enron against anyone 
that is currently pending or was pending at that time.  We do not know who 
the lawyers they claimed to have consulted were.  Please advise me if there 
is someone else I should ask.
Thanks for your help!
Kind regards,
Michelle

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

We received several votes in favor of Charles Tetrault's suggestion to
meet the week after the Feb. 22 hearing, rather than on Feb. 23-24, and
that makes sense to us as well.  Tom Nicholas advises that the Wright
group would like the meeting to be held February 27-28 in Houston,
rather than Denver.   Jay Barrymore would prefer the meeting be held
March 5-6 in Denver.  Clay Latimer is available February 27-28 and would
prefer the meeting be held in Denver.  I was unable to reach Clay this
afternoon to determine if March 5-6 would work for him.  We have
confirmed availability among hotels in downtown Denver to host for
either date window.  Some of the Wright folks are reportedly checking on
availability of Houston hotels for February 27-28.  The Kansas Steering
Committee is meeting by phone tomorrow morning, and we will need to come
to a final decision in the next day or two on which to base meeting
plans.  Wright lead defense counsel are concentrated in Houston, and so
it might make sense for the Wright group to meet independently and in a
different location; however, there are a number of counsel who will need
to attend both meetings, so the meetings probably should not be at the
same time in different cities.  Thus far, we have not announced plans to
any of the JDT groups at large.

Richard, my larger projects are peaking right now, and Kristina suggested 
that I ask you whether you would like to manage this matter.  

A Citgo gasoline pipeline was ruptured by our subcontractor (Wilde 
Construction) last May, near Luling TX.  Citgo has incurred aprox. $700k of 
cleanup costs.   We believe the costs should be shared by Citgo (for failing 
to correctly mark the line), Wilde (for negligently striking the line), and 
Bechtel ( for not being present as our construction manager, knowing that 
Wilde was working near the gasoline line).  The new complication:  The spill 
may prevent the proposed buyer from purchasing the 1000-odd acres parcel 
affected by the spill.  If that purchase doesn't go through, the attorney for 
the Mexican national landowner told me that the mortgage on the land would be 
foreclosed, and the landowner would bring an action for the lost purchase 
price ($1.3MM) (which I doubt he could fully recover, since he could sell the 
property for some lesser amount).

I am setting up a mediation (of Citgo, Bechtel, and Wilde), where John Odam 
(our atty, with Mangham Hardy) would act as mediator.  The new info about the 
land claim may change that strategy.

Would you like to manage this, or be somewhat involved, or not involved?

Thanks,

Kenton

I want to get involved in this.  Michelle will bring me up-to-date.  I don't 
understand why we are considering Brazilian court versus ICC arbitration.

Michelle Blaine
02/01/2001 07:36 PM
1. Consent Issue:  Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) 
reported that he met with Furnas this week.  Furnas had not received  EPE's 
letter addressing the consent issue.  Furnas continues to link its failure to 
sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There 
are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows 
whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it 
is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask 
our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.  
Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, 
Electronorte. 

2.  Arbitration considerations:  Bestard has a meeting planned with the 
ambassador.  He  consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, 
Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political 
avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, 
however, is  his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek 
assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political 
battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to 
seek political assistance.  My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to 
progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has 
expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong 
message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we 
proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 
of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at 
the end of which we have the option to terminate.  This buys us a little 
time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate 
proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.  I'm not sure what 
reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure 
how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the 
commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.  I am not sure 
what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may 
affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look 
at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or 
express waivers related to timing in this regard).  I committed that we would 
advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with 
respect to  arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand 
every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix 
developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own 
way.  Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have 
traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who 
represents them. 

3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE 
does not have a valid force majeure claim.  Based on my reading of the 
contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95(c).   However, I'm 
told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that 
we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.  Laine 
Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our 
force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our 
position.    Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both 
parties have the right to terminate.  No one buys the plant and we're stuck.  
I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.  There have been several.

4.  Budget:  Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration 
concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,  what 
it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. 
Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.  We may want to 
consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of 
proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a 
number to it.  I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.  It 
needs to be subject to review as we go along.

5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going 
to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and 
get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best 
advice.  We certainly have some conflicting views.  Our experience in the 
Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so 
I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in 
the court anyway.  If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position 
that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.  Who knows.
Please give me your comments or just call me.  I'm open to any suggestions. 
John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I 
may be unaware of with any strategic plan.
Regards,
Michelle

Richard Bianchi has proposed August 20 for the arbitration, which he believes 
will not last more than a day..  Does that work for you and our possible 
witnesses,if any? Short of the offtakers, which Max is concerned about 
involving, who would you have in mind--since we are posturing  this as an msj 
case?  If the date works, I would suggest that we try to depose McKenna as 
soon as possible to see if there is any additional discovery we really need. 
Let me hear from you'all and then I'll ask Tom to contact the other 
arbitrators about their availability and the preparation of some kind of 
scheduling order for discovery, motions, etc. deadlines.

Whatever happened with this?  Also--we need to caution the non-lawyers to be 
careful what they put in E-mails about this incident.

Robert Quick
03/13/2000 09:37 AM
there has been an HSE incident at Redcar in relation to a stockpile of Enron 
coal. We are still awaiting details and I will report as and when more 
information is available. I have discussed this with Michael, and it seems 
that almost certainly we will need to involve outside counsel. The firm that 
springs to mind having both coal and litigation experience is Linklaters. If 
anyone has any thoughts on this perhaps they wd let me know. tks

John Moran

I agree with your comments that we cannot get out of our resposibilities and 
as such were obliged to provide the information.  Not to do so could have 
looked suspicious especially  when it is highly unlikely that their will be 
anything in the analysis document to show our coal to be more problematic 
than anyone else's.  As I said this morning, all fumes from coal fires are 
toxic and prolonged exposure will cause headaches, sickness etc..  This is 
not a function of the coal quality but of the combustion of the coal causing 
toxic gases. Consequently Mark Patten is concerned that Corus are not open to 
criticism for inadequate safety procedures and is trying to protect their own 
position.  Certainly the heating in the stockpile is to an extent due to the 
delay in moving the pile.

Robert Quick
13/03/2000 14:56
George, tks for this. I understand from Scott that the certificate was sent 
anyway this morning. The delivery terms under the confirm provide for site 
delivery so that the coal belongs to Enron. To that extent we cannot evade 
our responsibility. However, if the problems with the stockpile have arisen 
as a result of Mission not taking the coal, then we have an argument to say 
that the issue has been caused by EME not Enron. Let's find out more, and we 
may need to put Mission on notice. tks

Robert  

Scott - please get with Robert Quick on this first.  This does not sound like 
something we want to get involved with.

will dig out and send it over.

   

Please respond to <mail@jwmoran.freeserve.co.uk>
Mark Patten has just phoned me back regarding the hot coal.

One of their shovel drivers apparently felt ill on Friday and it is believed
it was due to fumes being emitted from the pile. He needs a copy of the Cape
Oceania coal quality analysis for health and safety reasons. Could you
please send one up to him. I explained to him that coal contains just about
every element you can think of and the fumes from the pile are toxic, as
from any coal fire, but he feels he needs the information to protect
himself.

Thank you, but I cannot attend.

Laurie and Alan: confirming my call with Laurie today, our existing client
has waived the potential conflict we mentioned, and I ask your advice as to
whether Enron would also be willing to waive.

The potential conflict is in a totally unrelated matter.  We represent TDC
Corporation.  I understand that there is a dispute between TDC and Enron
relating to a collar agreement.  I am not certain if this is merely in
dispute or if it is the subject of litigation at this point.

If Enron is not interested in our undertaking the representation at the
Orion facility, we certainly understand.  If it is, would it be possible to
obtain a waiver of the unrelated conflict?

Thank you for your patience in this matter.  Marilyn

Richard, I echo John's desire to have all our ducks lined up to avoid the 
additional $4.5 million funding.  Although this amount is not huge by Enron 
standards, in this case any further funding has no chance of recovery and 
would be an immediate writeoff.  As you know, this "project" has had 
extremely high visibility.  We need to leave no stone unturned!  Thanks.

I have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default 
under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The 
Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in 
full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, 
etc.  There is not 180 day period.  There is nothing.  Nonetheless, this does 
highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to 
weigh our options and strategy.  This is specially true for matters with 
respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that 
remains unfunded.  The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation 
expires on June 30, 2001.  At that time we have an argument that we will not 
replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not 
going to fund.

I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now.   
Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared.  
An analysis would include.

1.  Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make 
sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement.  
In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we 
want to make certain that no rights have been waived.  Also, we want to put 
them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need 
to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications.

2.  Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the 
current default.

3.  Understand our obligations.  The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 
million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit).  
By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.  Can they 
cure the default and make us fund.  What does bankruptcy do to this scenario.

Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues.

Attached is my first attempt to frame the applicable provisions regarding 
Enron's obligation to increase its Stabilization Fund letter of credit by 
$4.5 million on the Completion Date.  It appears that the major issues are 
(1) can they pass the Endurance Benchmark (24 day test) and (ii) that the 
estimated cost to complete the facility is in excess of amounts in the 
Interest Subaccount, Construction Fund, and Equity Contribution Account.  I 
am currently thinking that if it cost more than $4.5 million to complete the 
facility, senior lenders may not want to pursue completion in order to obtain 
our $4.5 million.

With regard to the removal of the Pier 23 case, it is unclear whether Enron
Corp. and EES were properly served.

We have the following documents:

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for "Year 1" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for "Year 35" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly "running in the other direction" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied "mid-stream" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged "contract year" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month "Year 35" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a "global" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the "excess" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS "self bills" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
"overpayments" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the "excess" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?

Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of "Contract Capacity Factor" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage "haircut" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years "and thereafter from year to year," unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective "at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter." (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain "stub" years and certain "long" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying "calendar year" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an "indication" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
"contract year" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those "old school" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

Liz/Richard

I suggest that we seek to rely upon Section 18(c) which says that 
"....pending resolution of the disagreement by arbitration, Seller shall 
continue to operate the Plant in a manner consistent with this Agreement and 
Consumers shall continue to pay all charges required in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of this Agreement."
 
Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed 
by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until 
any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each 
stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute 
resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers 
should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few 
years.
 
Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with 
a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of 
specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that 
they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute 
resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to 
seek such equitable relief.
 
We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always 
playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be 
out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not 
get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be 
no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them 
to delay any resolution of this dispute.
 
I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of 
documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our 
case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better 
understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made 
against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be 
collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved 
in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Sandy-

I just received the billing summary of power purchased from Michigan Power
Limited Partnership for January 2001.  As expected, they have used the
capacity charges corresponding to Year 6 (On Peak = $41.99/MWh, Off Peak
= $39.89).  Could you please draft a quick letter as suggested by Marcus
Nettelton.  The correct capacity charges should be On Peak  = $45.90/MWh,
Off Peak = $43.60/MWh.

Rick, I will fax you a copy of the billing summary and then you can forward
it others in your shop.

Thanks,

Ketan

Marcus.Nettelton@enron.com on 02/15/2001 11:48:19 AM

Further to the email sent yesterday by Eddy Daniels, we believe that if
Consumers Energy fail to adjust the amount of capacity charges in January
2001, which it appears that they are likely to do following their letter of
February 5, 2001, we are of the view that a notice of disagreement should
be sent to Consumers Energy.

In principle we suggest that the notice should dispute that the correct
capacity charge has been applied, stating the correct capacity charge and
requesting that Consumers Energy re-submit their invoice to reflect the
correct capacity charge.

Please do not hesitate to call me on 713 345 8161 to discuss this further.

Kind regards.

Gary---I think you should write the PX a letter asking:1) where this $ went, 
2) whether the Core performance bond has been paid and where that $ went,3) 
whether the State has paid them any $ for the block forward positions, 4) has 
a claim been made on the CTS performance bond and is it still active given 
the State's action, 5)How did they calculate the $17mm chargeback they sent 
us, 6)what other $ has been collected to minimize the chargebacks
If anyone has anything else they think we should ask the PX please send Gary 
and me a note.

Just a reminder:  The ISO held a Firm Transmission Right ("FTR") auction last 
month that netted the California IOUs $80 million.  That money is credited to 
their account to reduce their revenue requirement for access charges (it 
reduces the amount of money that the utilities' ratepayers pay for 
transmission access charges).

As creditors, we should have some claim against that money.

Richard,
  I am writing to request a conflict waiver so that one of my partners Fred
Holden can represent JEA, a water sewer and electrical utility located in
Jacksonville, Florida I connection with the pending PGE bankruptcy.  This
representation would be uder the same terms as the City of Palo Alto.  JEA
agrees we will not repesent them against Enron, they do not believe they
have claims against Enron and if JEA becomes adverse to Enron they agree we
ca represent Enron against them.

Thanks
Gary

All three arbitrators are okay with the week of August 20th.  How does it 
look at your end? Also, do we want a "reasoned opinion" or just a "decision" 
from them?  Since there are few, if any grounds for an appeal, McDade 
recommends a "decision". Ileana
>>> <Bonnie.White@enron.com> 02/13/01 11:07AM >>>
Ileana,

As of now, my calendar is clear for August 20th.  I will pencil this in,
although I think we should make sure that everybody also has the 21st open
in case the arbitration takes more than one day.  We will, of course, need
to have Max Yzaguirre available.  Even though we are posturing the case as
a summary judgment case, I think it would also be helpful to have Dwight
Beach and Steve Irwin available.  They would be the two best witnesses, I
think, to discuss all of the things that McKenna had not done in order to
have a viable project.  I believe this type of testimony would be helpful
to the arbitrators so that they would know that, in ruling on the contract
interpretation as a matter of law, they are also ruling in a fundamentally
fair manner--neither the law nor equity is on McKenna's side.  If you
agree, I will contact them about their availability.  I agree that we
should despose McKenna fairly quickly.  We will need to nail down what he
might say as to contacts with offtakers, etc., so that we can determine the
necessity of getting them involved.  If we do need to get them involved,
perhaps we could do so by way of affidavit rather than live testimony, or,
at most, by deposition.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

john,

sorry it has taken so long to reply to the copy of the fax from clyde & co 
which you passed to me some time ago.

basically, i reviewed the paper from sgs on copper corrosion contamination in 
lpg which reviewed possible scenarios of the lpg becoming off spec during a 
sea voyage. their conclusion was that propane which contained polysulphides 
could meet the copper corrosion tests at loading but then decompose during 
the long voyage to turn the propane off spec for copper corrosion. this 
position would support what clyde & co are saying as a factor against enron's 
case. 

the whole contamination problem, while possibly an inherent vice, was an 
unknown inherent vice. nobody was aware of this problem at the time of 
loadings but rather the problem came to light once some of the first ships 
reached their discharge ports. the sgs report also brings into account other 
reasons for the copper corrosion failure such as:

a) unclean cargo tanks, containing sulfur from previous cargoes,
b) mixing of two grades of lpg, both initially on spec,
c) the use of unclean inert gas, and
d) other incompatible corrosive cargoes (such as ammonia) by improper 
cleaning procedures.

i did take the liberty to call chris clucas of dorchester maritime's 
technical department whom i met when dorchester was managing the enron owned 
ships. it was chris who initially sent me the sgs paper as an update to the 
gastech 1988 paper.

it may be a good thing i did call him as he mentioned a subsequent paper 
issued by sgs in about 1998, by g.vermeiren, where sgs went to saudi to check 
their procedures during the time of these off spec cargo loadings. it appears 
the paper's conclusion is that unknowingly saudi may have put some pacifiers 
into the propane which would have caused the copper corrosion to show as on 
spec. therefore, the product could have actually been off spec before it was 
loaded but, due to the pacifiers, tested as on spec.

in summary, i would agree with clyde & co that this should be settled, 
especially with the amount being discussed. i do not know where this claim 
stands and again apologize for the delayed reply.

regards

Looks good. I would send it from me to Lisa Urrick at the PX instead. What do 
you think?

	Steve C Hall

Gary,

The only suggestion I have for the letter involves your reference to the FTR 
Auction.  I would propose that you revise 2(b) of the letter to read as 
follows:

b. Has the CalPX made any attempts to have the ISO apply the approximately 
$80 million in proceeds from the ISO's recent Firm Transmission Right auction 
to PG&E and Edison's ISO real-time charges incurred while the CalPX was 
acting as Scheduling Coordinator for the two utilities?

Here is the original sentence:  "b. Has the CalPX credited the $80,000,000 in 
auction revenue for the Firm Transmission Rights from the auction held in 
January in any of these chargeback calculations?"

The FTR proceeds are held by the ISO, not the PX, making it impossible for 
the PX to credit the IOUs for these amounts.    

Steve

and greet with Enron's UH Law Center Alumni and friends on Tuesday, March 6 
at 8am in the 50M Dining Room.  

Dean Rapoport has been visiting all of the big law firms and law departments 
in an effort to introduce herself to the Houston legal community.  She has 
promised to give us a briefing on her vision and plans for the Law Center.  I 
have met the Dean already, and she is very impressive.  She should really 
invigorate the place.  

Please RSVP by responding to this email or by calling Jim Grace at x57702.

Also, please examine the address list.  If you see that any UH grad has been 
missed, please forward this on that person.  Thanks.

FYI - In case you haven't seen this.

In case you haven't heard, the Supreme Court has granted cert of our and the 
state of New York's cert petitions on the extent of FERC's jurisdiction over 
transmission facilities.

Date: Mon, 26 Feb 2001 11:18:06 -0600
Attached is Lou Cohen's (of Wilmer Cutler) write up of the Supreme Court's 
grant of two petitions for certiorari in the appeals of FERC's Order No. 888 
on transmission open access.  While too much should never be read into a 
grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate 
Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory 
in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are 
asking the Court to expand the native load exception.  It should also be 
noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. 
petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.  
Enron's brief is due in 45 days.  Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next 
week to get this process started.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you 
need  more.
?
The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the 
D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 
225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other 
states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt 
state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail 
customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New 
York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power 
Marketing,  Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 00-809) to consider whether FERC has 
jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including 
transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under 
the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring 
transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all 
users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together, 
probably not before October  2001.

Hopefully this provides what you are looking for, however, there is more to 
come.

Please note the fourth paragraph requesting the total labor and expenses for 
the "big picture".  This was discussed at our first meeting and hopefully, 
you can produce same or make it available to him for inspection.

Also, we need to quickly resolve the "missing System 700 book".  If it 
exists, lets produce it.  If not, we need to advise that it was 
miscommunication or whatever, but we need to do so soon.

I thought we were going to advise that we had appointed a "point" person to 
deal with extracting information from the subcontractors.  Apparently this 
was not communicated to Claude.  Do you want to re-consider allowing him to 
go direct?  
Jim/Russ/Ron,

This will confirm our tele-conference this AM on the pending claim filed on
behalf of Doyle.

Unfortunately, my meeting at Dean-Oliver did not fully take place on the
intended scope as Charlie McCorkle had to take his wife to the doctor on an
unexpected trip.  I am out of town until Friday, but we do plan on meeting
Friday afternoon, I will respond on any additional information outstanding.
(Charlie had Kelly McKenzie's book with him)

You had ask that I further explain our deductions on the reduced Craft Labor
hours detailed in my last letter.  In our December meeting it was noted that
NEPCO was in a support roll to Elliott on the rebuild.  NEPCO had their most
involvement at the very beginning and very end of the repairs.  The repair
area had its own trailers, parts warehouse and staging area.  We discussed
in the meeting that the support roll essentially would take a Supervisor and
three employees per shift or about eight per 24 day.  In review of the
submitted labor it is noted that an average of three Start-up Employees
charged their full day to this job from 6/15 up to 7/3, then 4 up to 7/17,
then 6+ up to the final completion of repairs, 7/23.  At the same time,
Office Staff employees averaged charging up to 8 employees per day, day
shift, during the repair time and continued to charge labor up to a month
after.  The Craft Labor group charged an average of 11 employees per day
charging all of their work day to the repairs.  When you average it out, you
had around 13 support personnel for an Elliott crew on every shift (24
hours), when the Elliott crew consisted of about 13 to 15 persons.  This
would account for between 25 to 30 people (without consultants &
sub-contractors) time charged working every hour, 24 hours the entire time.
Add the consultants/subcontractors and it goes up to a minimum of 30 people.
This is unrealistic by any standard and cannot be explained away as an
inefficiency of site versus shop work.

One of our requests in our meeting in Houston was that additional
information concerning the total labor and expenses charged to the entire
site be made available to see the "big picture" of the site labor and
expense charges on a weekly or monthly basis.  This additional information
or it's location has not been forthcoming to date.  There has to be some
type of summary cost details which Doyle was billed on a per Unit basis.

I also noted that I would comment on differences in scope of repair, thus a
lesser measurement of the loss & payable claim.   I have been commenting on
differences in scope since my first letter and subsequently as information
has been made available.  The major scope differences are:
1. Partial vs. full stationary and rotor blades
2. Repaired versus replaced 1st Stage Turbine Buckets & Nozzles
3. Use of "old" designed stub shaft vs. purchase of "new" designed stub
shaft
4. Overscope of repairs by Preco on work completed in their shop.
5. Elliott overscope of repairs associated with some of the above items,
misalignment and other items noted in my e-mail of 1/24 (including work
completed on Units #2 & #3).
6. NEPCO labor charges noted above.

There are a number of lessor items.  If the meeting this Friday takes place,
I will respond as fully as possible to the claim next week based on
documentation we have received to date.  It is unfortunate that there was no
"System 700" or similar type book completed on the repairs.  Our discussions
in Houston and up until recently indicated that this was an SOP at NEPCO.
As I noted the Kelly McKenzie book is not a complete view of the repairs
made.

The request to directly contact sub-contractors to discuss their scope of
work in my last letter has not been responded to.

Once again, I will e-mail you after our meeting Friday with any requested
support items that were to be included in this e-mail.

Claude

fyi per e-mail.  thanks, ron.
Jim,

I just tried to call you.  I wanted to get the attached to you before next
week.

Presently, Enron on behalf of Doyle has filed a claim for $6,212,577.54 in
Property Damage as a result of the mechanical failure on 6/14/00.  The
attached 40+ page spread sheet details Factory Mutual's review of the
covered claim with adjustments for overscope or overstatement of repair and
Exclusion E (Defective material, design, workmanship) of the General
Exclusions in the policy issued to Doyle.  The review is based on
information obtained or documentation submitted to date.  All adjustments
are subject to further discussion and submission of documentation, therefore
the adjustments should be considered estimates.  Scope adjustments are
$3,488,310.58; Exclusion E adjustments are $437,865.67, resulting in an
estimated measured claim of $2,286,401.29.

Please contact me to arrange a meeting to discuss the adjustments in detail
in Houston after next week (I have confirmed that as a group, the four of us
that came down for the last meeting cannot arrange).

Richard,

I have attached an e-mail forwarded to Claude Chandler (FM Global) in 
response to an earlier e-mail from him and another e-mail received last 
Friday stating their new position.  I will also send to you the e-mails from 
Claude I mentioned in the preceeding sentence.  

I will follow this with a phone call to you this morning so I can bring you 
up to speed on the activity associated with this insurance claim.  One item 
that needs your immediate attention is a provision in the Insurance Policy 
that could hamper our ability to litigate if this becomes our only viable 
alternative to resolve the differences.  There is a deadline for litigation 
tied to the date of the initial failure (one year which would make it June 
15, 2001).  It also requires that prior to litigation, the parties need to 
first resolve through dispute resolution/arbitration.  It has been my 
experience that arbitration normally takes 90-120 days.  There is only one 
defined action with days attached to it in the policy (60 days to establish 
reps for each party).  I think you see the dilemna.

I look forward to our discussion.

Thanks, Ron.      
Ron Tapscott
02/26/2001 04:59 PM
Claude,

In regard to your e-mail dated February 7th, we will be sending to you 
(tomorrow for overnight delivery) documentation in support of our claim and 
responses to address other open issues as stated in your e-mail.  The 
information will address the following:

Previous detail and summaries of the original insurance claim amount of 
$6,452,318.02
New detail and summaries for Enron's current position, including --
detailed labor breakdowns for services provided by Elliott and NEPCO.  This 
will identify labor hours and charges by: day, craft, individual, rate 
classification if applicable (i.e., straight time, over time and double 
time), etc.
Support for overhead charges applicable to NEPCO's billing
Support for other charges associated with Unit I claim not previously 
identified (i.e., insurance for the repair period for Unit I)
Detail and summaries of other NEPCO services provided but not associated with 
Unit I repair/claim
Letters or documentation in support of major scope differences

Note: The detail related to the NEPCO charges will follow (by end of this 
week). 

In addition, I spoke with Grady James, the Doyle Facility Plant Manager, and 
he indicated that the "System 700" documentation prepared by NEPCO was made 
available to you at the site.  This documentation was provided along with the 
Unit 1-3 refurbishment documentation.  Fortunately, this information 
continues to be maintained at the site and is available for your review (at 
the site) if you wish.  In regard to other documentation or notes, the 
information forwarded by Russ Porter in early February should have satisfied 
all previous requests.  If there is a specific request beyond what we have 
already forwarded, we will respond accordingly.

You also indicated in your e-mail a desire to directly contact 
sub-contractors to discuss their scope of work.  As a result of 
confidentiality provisions within the service agreements, I would request 
that you indicate to me who you would like to contact and we will provide the 
necessary waivers to those parties.   

Last, we just received your e-mail (dated Friday, Feb. 23) related to FM 
Global's current position.  Obviously we are disappointed that the two 
parties are this far apart.  Can I assume that this position reflects 
everything you characterized as outstanding in your e-mail (i.e., awaiting 
signoff from Charlie McCorckle and others)?  I assume we will have questions 
as we continue to review the material.  Should we forward those to you?  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments on 713-853-9298.  
Thanks, Ron.

timing is bad. Thanks forthe resume.

Richard --

Just spoke with Sheila Tweed.  She said the company filled the slot for
which we presented George Bernhardt and suggested I contact you about
the company's attorney needs.

We have an attorney who did a clerkship at Marathon Oil (Houston) while
a University of Connecticut law student.  Since graduating in '94, he
has gained legal experience solely in Moscow doing energy work while at
international firms (including the London-based Denton Hall firm).  He
has a project finance background which made me think of your team at
Enron.

Are these credentials which interest you and the company?  Please give
me a ring or drop a line letting me know when you get a moment.  I
appreciate.

Best regards,

Gm.

Bob, thanks.  I'll look this over, but if it is just more software to catch 
firms sending an extra associate to a deposition I'm not interested.  I think 
there is an art to managing outside counsel to get the best out them, and the 
approaches these systems follow is usually more harmful than productive.  As 
a result, I am usually pretty cool to these programs.  And I am certain that 
there is no way Kristina or Vicki will approve any payment to someone who is 
making a pitch from our business, if that is in the offing.  Sorry to be such 
a downer on this.  Maybe Richard is interested.  It does seem that the EWS 
litigation is raging out of control.

Rob,
 Some time ago you received a copy of the letter from Rick Salomon of Vantage 
Point Consultants which included a proposal for making a presentation to 
Enron's Legal Department regarding management of outside counsel. The seminar 
would be targeted to those Enron attorneys who are litigation managers or 
otherwise supervise the work of outside counsel. The cost for the 
presentation is $5000. From talking to Mr. Salomon, I understand that his 
seminar is an effort to expose Enron's Legal Dept to what other companies are 
doing regarding managing outside counsel, and his ultimate hope is to be able 
to enter into an agreement to provide assistance to Enron in reducing its 
outside legal costs through a variety of methods, including fee arrangements, 
billing practices and procedures and the like. Mr. Salomon's list of clients 
is impressive. Would you like me to proceed with arranging the presentation? 
I'd be happy to discuss further.

I would involve Michelle Cash or someone in Enron Corp who deals with 
labor/employment issues. I am surprised this issue has not come up before.

	Peter Keohane
	02/27/2001 06:06 PM
		 
Jim, we have a former employee who tried to exercise options which had 
expired on the 31st day after employment termination, as the 30th day 
provided for in the grant agreement was a Sunday.  Paine Webber refused and 
she then asked us to honour the obligation in any event or to change her 
employment termination date.  In consultation with Enron Corp. (Mary Joyce 
and Michael Fauerbacher) the request was denied.  She has now sued both Enron 
Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. in the Alberta courts.  The amount is not large 
($US27,000) but he principle and precedent value is.  I think our position is 
very strong but there are some issues around the calculation of days from 
termination and performance required on non-business days (which is not 
provided for in the grant agreements).  I have a call with Mary Joyce and 
Michael Fauerbacher of Enron Corp. tomorrow and was going to involve 
litigation counsel - Dalton McGrath - a partner at Blake Cassels and Graydon 
who is in my estimation very effective and aggressive.  Is this OK with you 
and/or do we need to involve outside counsel in Houston to monitor Enron 
Corp.'s interests?

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards, Peter.

Gary,

The only suggestion I have for the letter involves your reference to the FTR 
Auction.  I would propose that you revise 2(b) of the letter to read as 
follows:

b. Has the CalPX made any attempts to have the ISO apply the approximately 
$80 million in proceeds from the ISO's recent Firm Transmission Right auction 
to PG&E and Edison's ISO real-time charges incurred while the CalPX was 
acting as Scheduling Coordinator for the two utilities?

Here is the original sentence:  "b. Has the CalPX credited the $80,000,000 in 
auction revenue for the Firm Transmission Rights from the auction held in 
January in any of these chargeback calculations?"

The FTR proceeds are held by the ISO, not the PX, making it impossible for 
the PX to credit the IOUs for these amounts.

Richard,

 Per Gary's request, here is the status of Duke Energy v. Governor
Davis and ISO v. Reliant.

Duke v. State of California.

 According to a news article, on February 27, 2001, Duke Energy Corp.
suspended its lawsuit against Gray Davis and the State "after the California
Department of Water Resources agreed to buy power from Duke that was
formerly being provided under contracts with two financially trouble
utilities."

 Originally, Duke argued that Governor Davis exceeded his authority
under the Emergency Services Act when he commandeered Duke's long-term
contracts.

 The case is suspended until an April 30 hearing.  I am trying to
obtain a copy of any order and/or stipulation filed with the Court.

ISO v. Reliant, et al.

 I.  Brief Summary of Complaint

 In ISO v. Reliant, et al., ISO seeks a preliminary injunction to
require six Reliant entities, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading, four AES
entities, and Dynegy Power Corporation (collectively, "Defendants") to
provide generation in response to ISO's emergency dispatch instructions.

 ISO's sole allegation is that because Defendants submitted to the
ISO Tariff by participating in the ISO markets and by entering into
Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and Participating Generator Agreements,
Defendants cannot refuse to generate in response to an emergency dispatch
order.  This allegation is based upon section 5.6.1 of the Tariff.

 II.  Current Status of the Case -- February 23, 2001 Stipulation

On February 23, 2001, the parties entered a stipulation, which states, in
relevant part:

   The Reliant Defendants, Williams, and Dynegy
(collectively "Generator Defendants") will comply with emergency dispatch
orders of the California ISO under the terms of the ISO tariff without
regard to whether ISO allocates the cost of power produced in response to
such a dispatch order to a creditworthy Scheduling Coorindator until the
earlier of the following:

   (a) 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on March 19,
2001, or

   (b) two business days (but in no event less than 48
hours) after written notice to this Court and the parties by a Generator
Defendant that this stipulated obligation is terminated as to it.

   3. Notice of termination by a Generator Defendant of
its obligation under paragraph 2(b) shall not affect the stipulated
obligations or remaining Generator Defendants except that, on receipt of
such notice, each remaining Generator Defendant shall have the right to file
with the Court an election terminating its obligation. In the event of such
an election, the obligation of a terminating Generator Defendant to comply
with ISO dispatch orders imposed by paragraph 2 shall end 48 hours after
written notice to ISO of the election to terminate. Each terminating
Generator Defendant shall have the same right and status to participate in
any legal proceedings that follow the initial notice of termination,
including any appeal.

   4. The motions heard by this Court on February 16,
2001, including ISO's motion for preliminary injunction, Reliant's motion to
dismiss or stay pursuant to the FERC order, and DWR's motion to dismiss
Reliant's third party complaint, will be deemed submitted at 5:00 p.m. on
March 16, 2001, or at 5:00 p.m. on the day written notice of termination of
the obligation stipulated in paragraph 2 is filed with the Court, whichever
is earlier.

 III.  February 16th Hearing

 Below is a summary of the hearing held on February 16th in the
Reliant case, which I initially prepared on Saturday, February 17th.  I
apologize if you did not receive this earlier.

>  The hearing involved three motions:
>
>  (A) ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction
>  (B) Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or Stay
>  (C) DWR's Motion to Dismiss Third Party Complaint
>
>  Judge Damrell took each motion under submission and stated that he
> will issue an order on or before February 21, 2001 at 5:00 p.m.  He
> ordered the February 8, 2001 TRO to remain in effect until then.  Judge
> Damrell clarified that the TRO requires Defendants to respond to all ISO
> Emergency Dispatch Orders ("EDOs") regardless of the creditworthiness of
> the purchasers.  The Judge encouraged Defendants to stipulate that they
> would respond to ISO EDOs, and gave Defendants until February 20, 2001 to
> do so.  (It appears that only AES is willing to do so at this time).
>
Summary

>  ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Reliant's Motion to
> Dismiss/ Stay are linked in that they essentially relate to the same
> issue:  Are generators obligated to respond to EDOs despite having no
> assurances that they will be paid, i.e., assurances that a creditworthy
> purchaser will be buying the generation in response to the EDO?
>
>  A.  Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or to Stay
>
>  Reliant's motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay was based
> solely upon a February 14, 2001 FERC order conditionally adopting ISO's
> proposed Amendment 36.  This FERC Order (as I understand it from the
> arguments) allows ISO to waive the creditworthy requirement only with
> respect to PG&E and SCE scheduling of energy to meet their own load.
>
>  Parsing the Order, Reliant argued that the Order implicitly means
> that the creditworthy requirement is not waived with respect to all other
> purchases, including EDOs.  Because of the FERC Order, Reliant argued that
> ISO's complaint, which seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants to
> respond to EDOs without assurances of creditworthiness, should be
> dismissed.  Alternatively, Reliant argued that because the proceeding
> before FERC continues, the Court should stay this case pending the outcome
> by FERC.
>
>  ISO argued that according to the language of the FERC Order, FERC
> explicitly did not rule on the issue related to the application of the
> creditworthiness requirement to EDOs.  And, a stay is improper because due
> to energy crisis, ISO cannot wait for FERC to decide this issue.
>
>  Analysis:  Judge Damrell appeared very skeptical of Reliant's
> interpretation of the Order.  He asked, "If FERC intended that the
> creditworthy requirements apply to EDO, why didn't it address it head-on,
> especially because the importance of this issue was raised by Dynegy
> before FERC?"  He questioned Reliant about several sentences in the Order
> which suggest that FERC explicitly did not decide the issue.
>
>  Judge Damrell is unlikely to stay the proceedings.  He stated that
> the exigencies of the situation are such that he perhaps he should not
> wait for FERC to rule.  He made several comments about how long it takes
> FERC to act, and that the Federal Courts should step in times of crisis
> such as this.
>
>  B.  ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction
>
>  In support of its motion for a preliminary injunction to require
> Defendants to provide generation in response to EDOs, ISO argued as
> follows: (1) Defendants submitted to the ISO Tariff by participating in
> the ISO markets and by entering into Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and
> Participating Generator Agreements; (2) Section 5.6.1 of the Tariff
> obligates Defendants to respond to EDOs; (3) EDOs are essential to "keep
> the lights on;" and (4) because the decision to issue EDOs are made only
> in times of emergencies, the ISO does not look at who the purchaser is, is
> not required to by the Tariff, and should not be required to because of
> the current energy crisis.
>
>  Defendants argued that they need not respond to an EDO without
> assurances that they would be selling to a creditworthy purchaser because
> (1) the creditworthy requirement is an essential element of the Tariff;
> and (2) a 2/14/01 FERC Order held that the creditworthy requirement
> applies even EDOs.
>
>  Dynegy raised an additional argument -- ISO and DWR are using the
> EDO procedures to get a price below market and that there is no real
> threat that the lights will go out.  According to Dynegy, DWR can back
> real time purchases including EDOs, but instead DWR backs only purchases
> at a certain price below market.  If generators refuse, ISO issues an EDO,
> with no assurances that the generators will get paid, as a strong arm
> tactic to get this below market price.  Dynegy argued that the reality is
> that the lights will not go out because if generators do not abide by the
> EDOs, DWR has enough money to buy at market rate.  There would be no issue
> here if DWR would pay the just and reasonable rate for the electricity,
> rather than using EDO procedures to lower the rate.  And, DWR can go to
> FERC if it believes that the rate is unjust and unreasonable.
>
>  Analysis:  Judge Damrell certainly appeared to be leaning towards
> the ISO.  He expressed his views that this case involves a narrow issue --
> do the Defendants have an obligation to respond to EDO's without
> assurances that it will get paid in this time of crisis.  His questions
> and comments suggest that he believes that the amount of energy subject to
> the EDO's is small and necessary to avert rolling black-outs.  He
> questioned Mr. Detmer, manager of operation of ISO, who suggested that
> about 5% of purchases at peak are made through EDOs.
>
>  Judge Damrell was not very sympathetic towards Dynegy's argument,
> asking "Are you was saying that DWR, ISO and the State are the cause of
> the crisis?"  Several times, Judge Damrell stated that he thought the high
> wholesale prices caused the crisis.  According to Judge Damrell, "the
> simple fact is, you got rich, and the utilities went broke."  Also, as
> noted above, Judge Damrell does not believe that waiting for FERC to make
> decisions is the proper course in the current energy crisis because FERC
> does not act quickly enough.
>
>  C.  DWR's Motion to Dismiss 3rd Party Complaint

 Reliant brought a third party complaint against DWR, and DWR moved
to dismiss.  As framed by the Court, the key issue is:  does 11th Amendment
prohibit Reliant from joining DWR in the case?  Judge Damrell asked about
the 11th Amendment immunity argument, stating that the issue was not
thoroughly briefed.  The Judge asked the parties to file supplemental briefs
on the issue.

 I am obtaining a copy of these supplemental briefs and I will
summarize DWR's argument in a subsequent email.

I told Sandy that this looked fine to me but I am not a trasactional lawyer. 
I just want to make sure you know the obvious: Intratex has the Beeson case 
attached to it so we nedd to maintain our ability to bankrupt or otherwise 
separate this company from Mother Enron.

Richard,
In connection with the sale of Houston Pipe Line Company, we are transferring 
ownership in the above-referenced companies from HPL to an entity now named 
LOA, Inc. which, until closing of the HPL sale, is a wholly owned sub of HPL. 
At, or just prior to closing, that ownership will be transferred to Enron 
Corp. since these companies are excluded assets. There is a note in the Corp. 
Secretary's records that indicates no mergers or consolidations of assets of 
these entities should take palce without Bob Williams approval. I am assuming 
that now means you and I do not believe the transfer of the stock qualifies 
as either a merger or a consolidation. However, since I believe the issue 
centers around pending or threatened litigation I thought I would pass this 
along in the event you needed to know or had an issue with it. Please let me 
know ASAP if you do--I am making the conveyance effective February 28th

Thanks,
Sandi

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for "Year 1" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for "Year 35" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly "running in the other direction" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied "mid-stream" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged "contract year" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month "Year 35" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a "global" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the "excess" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS "self bills" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
"overpayments" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the "excess" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?

Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of "Contract Capacity Factor" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage "haircut" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years "and thereafter from year to year," unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective "at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter." (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain "stub" years and certain "long" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying "calendar year" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an "indication" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
"contract year" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those "old school" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

I am scheduled to be in London next week.  I would like to sit down and talk 
to you about this.

Paul Simons suggested I wrote to you to inform you that I am presently 
handling a number of small arbitration/claims matters on behalf of Enron 
Metals, which are subject to English law and London arbitration (LME).  They 
are generally for quite small amounts (presently from US$ 68,000 to US$ 
approx. 400,000).  I would be grateful if you could let me know the extent to 
which you wish to be involved or to monitor these.

As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing 
counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's 
firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more 
aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she 
objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to 
withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her 
aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what 
Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, 
she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are 
doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the 
Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources. Thanks for your help.

I suggest that we seek to rely upon Section 18(c) which says that 
"....pending resolution of the disagreement by arbitration, Seller shall 
continue to operate the Plant in a manner consistent with this Agreement and 
Consumers shall continue to pay all charges required in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of this Agreement."
 
Since arbitration is the final stage in the dispute resolution process agreed 
by the parties and it has been agreed that there should be continuity until 
any dispute is finally resolved, this position should properly apply to each 
stage of the dispute resolution process. I suggest that since the dispute 
resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers 
should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few 
years.
 
Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with 
a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of 
specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that 
they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute 
resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to 
seek such equitable relief.
 
We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always 
playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be 
out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not 
get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be 
no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them 
to delay any resolution of this dispute.
 
I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of 
documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our 
case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better 
understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made 
against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be 
collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved 
in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?

Sandy-

I just received the billing summary of power purchased from Michigan Power
Limited Partnership for January 2001.  As expected, they have used the
capacity charges corresponding to Year 6 (On Peak = $41.99/MWh, Off Peak
= $39.89).  Could you please draft a quick letter as suggested by Marcus
Nettelton.  The correct capacity charges should be On Peak  = $45.90/MWh,
Off Peak = $43.60/MWh.

Rick, I will fax you a copy of the billing summary and then you can forward
it others in your shop.

Thanks,

Ketan

Marcus.Nettelton@enron.com on 02/15/2001 11:48:19 AM

Further to the email sent yesterday by Eddy Daniels, we believe that if
Consumers Energy fail to adjust the amount of capacity charges in January
2001, which it appears that they are likely to do following their letter of
February 5, 2001, we are of the view that a notice of disagreement should
be sent to Consumers Energy.

In principle we suggest that the notice should dispute that the correct
capacity charge has been applied, stating the correct capacity charge and
requesting that Consumers Energy re-submit their invoice to reflect the
correct capacity charge.

Please do not hesitate to call me on 713 345 8161 to discuss this further.

Kind regards.

Richard,

thanks for the voicemail.

We should definitely get together next week. Your assistant can coordinate 
this through mine - Tracy Foy on 44 207 783 7374.

If you are able to speak to the trading lawyers on lessons learnt from 
California, that would be great. Again, Tracy can coordinate.

I attach an org chart showing the lawyers in the group, for your info. Let us 
know if you want to meet up with anyone in particular. 

Litigation we have on going at the moment:

- ICI warranty litigation: legal: Jon Chapman, commercial: Matthew Scrimshaw

- CATS: legal: Mary Nell Browning, commercial: Peter Crilly

- Metals arbitrations: legal: Paul Johnson, commercial: various.

If you want to meet any particular commercial person, we can also broker that.

I'm in your hands. Let me know.

     Mark

Please send this to Mark Manela by e-mail. Mark--- thanks for the gift but as

I dont understand your message.Squires is the Judge. Susan Myres is the 
opposing counsel

	"Radack, Judge Sherry (DCA)" <Radack@DCA.CO.HARRIS.TX.US>
	05/22/2000 07:39 AM
		 
before I go asking around, it would be helpful to know what judge it is.

squires is wonderful.  judge probably sustained b/c objections were good.
he would be my first choice.

tell me asap who is the judge.

As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing
counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don
Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is
much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary
hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he
has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my
mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty
pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my
lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone
that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres,
and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources.
Thanks for your help.

We have been sued in Cleveland. Do you know any good commercial litigators?

To download the evaluation forms from PEP, please follow the steps below:

Your employees that should receive year end evaluations are listed below:

    MERAZ, CLAUDIA
    SWEET, TWANDA Y

Ronny's response was that he didn't know how he would break the news to his 
84 millionaires that they would be splitting $250,000. If only he knew how 
hard it was to get that paltry sum out of Enron. Although I did not talk to 
him, Haedicke tells me that Jim Derrick was very hesitant about making any 
offer. Given Jim"s attitude and Ronny's flippant response, I doubt very 
seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly I won't be. Press 
on.

If we are ever going to pursue this lawsuit, we should do it soon. Where do 
the traders stand on pricing/ MTM exposure?

Attached is the letter that legal believes should be sent to Venoco.  Please 
let me kow if you hav eny changes, otherwise please send this letter to 
Venoco by Friday.

As we have discussed, you may want to call Venoco to let them know this 
letter is coming.

Thanks. I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky.

That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually 
anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI 
litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is 
it going?

 He keeps saying that he "needs" the $15 million.  Maybe it's a budget thing. 
I think he really just wants to renegotiate the deal.  I don't think he 
thinks that IHI has the money to pay us back.

One of my partners has asked me to seek a conflict waiver so that we may
represent Clean Air Partners in a transaction opposite of Enron Corp.  We
would be preparing transaction documents for the private placement such as
Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
Charlie Vetters and

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
described above?

Tim,
 Here is the email you should send out with respect to retention of
hard copies of documents.
IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY
 REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
_____ who can arrange for storage.

2. What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.

Thanks
Gary

As outlined in Mark Haedicke's voicemail to you, I have attached a draft 
response to Long Island Power's letter.  We are attempting to obtain a

ISO Market Participants:

On March 7, 2001, the ISO distributed funds from the March 5 market
settlement of the December 2000 preliminary invoice.  The ISO distributed a
total of $45,779,567.97, of which $352,693.64 was applied to outstanding
November balances, and $45,426,874.33 was applied to December balances, as
shown below.   Total amounts payable to Market Participants related to the
December preliminary invoice were $1,490,781,469.67.  Accordingly, the
preliminary pay-out ratio for December was 3.05%, and the cumulative
November pay-out was 24.22%.

Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC
obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied
in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has
been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are
entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action
in federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v.
California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central
District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an
order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred
to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's
Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a
segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that
court.

Payments were made in accordance with ISO Tariff Section 11 and Settlements

The distributions were made in accordance with the following tariff
provision:

 11.16.1 Pro Rata Reduction of Payments.
 If it is not possible to clear the ISO Clearing Account on a Payment
Date because of an insufficiency of funds available in the ISO Reserve
Account or by enforcing any guarantee, letter of credit or other credit
support provided by a defaulting Scheduling Coordinator, the ISO shall
reduce payments to all ISO Creditors proportionately to the net amounts
payable to them on the relevant Payment Data to the extent necessary to
clear the ISO Clearing Account.  The ISO shall account for such reduction in
the ISO ledger accounts as amounts due and owing by the non-paying ISO
Debtor to each ISO Creditor whose payment was so reduced.

As noted above, certain parties have defaulted on their GMC obligations to
the ISO.  The ISO has a priority claim to the collection of its GMC.  As a
result of non-payment of the GMC by the parties listed above, the ISO
reduced the amounts payable to market participants by a total of $591,798.59
to satisfy the ISO's GMC obligation.  This action was consistent with
Settlements and Billing Protocol section 6.3.1.3.  Additionally, for those
parties who defaulted on their GMC obligation to the ISO, but who were to
receive funds from the market, the ISO has reduced their payout to reflect
their GMC default.

 SABP 6.3.1.3
 The ISO is authorized to instruct the ISO Bank to debit the ISO
Clearing Account and transfer to the relevant ISO account sufficient funds
to pay in full the Grid Management Charge falling due on any Payment Day in
priority to any other payments to be made on that or on subsequent days out
of the ISO Clearing Account.

Amounts collected from any party are first used to settle that party's
oldest outstanding amount payable, in accordance with SABP 6.10.4:

 SABP 6.10.4
 The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of amounts owing to
ISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of the creation of
such debts.

Accordingly, amounts received on 3/5/2001, were distributed to November 2000
and December 2000 creditors.  Payments received from parties who defaulted
in November were first applied to their November balances.  The $352,693.64
was distributed to creditors for the trade month of November 2000.

In accordance with Section 11.12 (and SABP 6.10.5) of the tariff, the ISO
will assess the defaulting parties interest at the ISO Default Interest Rate
(currently 10.5%:  prime plus 2%).

Certifications are required by Section 11.20.2 of the tariff.  Accordingly,
the ISO will provide such certification to ISO creditors.

 11.20.2 Evidence of Unpaid Amount.
 The ISO shall, on request, certify in writing the amounts owed by an
ISO Debtor that remain unpaid and the ISO Creditors to whom such amounts are
owed and shall provide certified copies of the relevant Preliminary and
Final Settlement Statements, invoices, and other documentation on which the
ISO's certificate was based to the ISO Debtor and the relevant ISO
Creditors.  An ISO certificate given under this Section 11.20.2 may be used
as prima facie evidence of the amount due by an ISO Debtor to ISO Creditors
in any legal proceeding.

The ISO will report further details on this situation when available.

What is the status of this? I agree with your analysis. However,If the core 
performance bond has been paid or otherwise extinguished and the CTS bond in 
no longer operable because of Davis' actions, then why is the PX holding on 
to our collateral? Is that question now before FERC? What happens if we lose 
at FERC---do we still have an argument worth pursuing here? I would like your 
and Gary's thoughts.

We should discuss Tuesday what our current goal is in the AAA arbitration we 
filed.  (An administrative conference call is scheduled for Wednesday, 
February 21, at noon PST.)

From our perspective, it would make sense to put the arbitration on hold 
pending FERC's ruling on the charge-backs.  (Based on a conversation with 
counsel this afternoon, the PX is perfectly willing to do this.)  If FERC 
ultimately rules against us, the PX would be able to assert a set-off that 
would wipe out the claim in the arbitration.  If FERC disapproves the 
charge-backs, it may be possible to resolve the excess collateral issue.

Let's discuss on Tuesday whether you agree, or whether there are reasons for 
active pursuit of the arbitration.

There is a conference call on Monday that I have asked the Quinn Emanuel 
folks to participate in.If anyone else wants to participate, contact Bill 
Urquhart. I am out on Spring Break but can be reached at 713-410-6128 or

Earlier this week, PG&E paid $177 million to the ISO.  The ISO has not 
distributed that money to creditors because of the Enron v. CalPX suit.  As 
documented in an earlier e-mail, Chris Stokley, Murray O'Neill, and I called 
the ISO's treasurer and explained that the judge's order expressly excluded 
payments to the CAISO from the PX's general right not to pay creditors.

The ISO now informs us that the CalPX plans to have PG&E's payment 
transferred to the PX into an escrow account.  I copied the key part of the 
ISO's document below, and the full document is attached.

"Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less GMC 
obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be applied 
in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The ISO has 
been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are 
entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action in 
federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v. 
California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM (Central District 
of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an order within 
the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred to the Cal PX 
for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's Preliminary 
Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a segregated interest 
bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that court."

I think we all would agree that the money belongs to ISO creditors, and that 
the PX has no claim on these funds.  My guess is that the PX would like to 
have this money so that it can deduct administrative expenses from it.  

If I can provide more information on this, let me know.

I am sending you a copy of the subpoena "served" on Glanville. I have just 
left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me 
this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept. You will notice that it 
is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter. I doubt it 
is effective. Feel free to call Glanville if you like. His no. is on the 
document.
Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was "served" last Sat the 
3rd. I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up 
with him. Linda's no. is 713-853-6104. Gary Grote's no. is 713-650-3131. Of

This is the asbestos case in which HPL was recently added as a defendant.  I 
spoke with Scott Wert, the plaintiff's counsel today.  HPL was sued as to 
only one plaintiff, Larry Don Williams.  I called to get info on why HPL was 
sued and alleged dates of exposure.  Wert advised me that HPL was added as a 
plaintiff because Larry Don Williams was allegedly exposed to asbestos while 
working for Thomas Construction Company at an HPL facility in Berkclair, 
Texas, during 1963 and 1964.  He also told me that Williams was allegedly 
exposed at a Houston Natural Gas Pipeline facility in Victoria, Texas, during 
1970-72.  (We have not yet been served as to Houston Natural Gas Pipeline.)  
Wert did not have information in his database as to Williams' employer during 
that time period.

Rob, as we have previously discussed, I assume that you will check to 
determine what policies of insurance might cover claims for those time 
periods.

Our answer date on this matter is next Monday, March 26, but plaintiffs' 
counsel has said that we can have a couple of extra weeks if we would like.  
I will send him a Rule 11 agreement to secure the extra time, so that we can 
investigate insurance coverage further. 

I know you have worked hard on this so I hate to start with a 
complaint........but this announcement is not the greatest. First, there is 
no link on the e-mail to make the trip to the site easy. Secondly, I tried  
the website address on several occasions with no luck. I am now giving up.

Dear Richard and Michelle:

Attached to this e-mail is a copy of my resume and a cover letter that I have
forwarded to Ms. Nedre Strambler with Enron's Human Resources department in
an attempt to find a Legal Assistant position there at Enron.  As you know I
was
Carrin Patman's paralegal for several years over at Bracewell & Patterson and
I
am hoping that I might be able to use the two of you as references should I
be contacted regarding the positions I've applied for.

Richard, in the Beeson matter I see that the Supreme Court rendered a
decision in Intratex's favor regarding the necessity of a new trial if
the Plaintiffs attempt to recertify the class. As I assume you are aware, I
was the person in charge of assembling and organizing all 1200 boxes of
documents relating to the various Intratex, HPL, Atapco, Beeson and Mills
matters and assisted Carrin and Neal Manne in many of the court appearances.
I believe that this experience can be very useful if I were to work for Enron.

Michelle, even though I only had an opportunity to work on a couple of your
projects while you were at B&P, I did have an opportunity to assist you and
others at Enron with the urgent project to produce employment records to the
FTC last fall. I really enjoyed working with you and would like to do so
again.

Any assistance you can offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Neal is having Mary O'Banion, his secretary, reschedule the Beeson conf. call 
this Wednesday for 2:30 PM.  I assume it will be the same call-in number and 
same password.  Talk to you then.

Thanks for the update. Andy will be handling this one.

Rob, Actually I sent out a demand letter, modelled on the demand letter you 
sent in the Glen Rice case, last Wednesday.   I thought that a copy had been 
sent to you, and I apologize if it has not.  (Lisa will be getting a copy to 
you this morning.)  I understood that you were on vacation and that Bob was 
going to be out on vacation on Thursday and Friday.  Because of the problem 
with CT and the possibility that our answer date would be as soon as this 
Thursday, 3/22, I didn't think it should wait until today.  When the service 
of process came in, I spoke with Andy Edison about it, he advised me of the 
Glen Rice matter, I pulled the file which included a copies of the contract, 
the certificate of insurance for Feb 2000-Feb 2001, and your demand letter.  
I asked Lisa to get the 1999-2000 certificate of insurance, which we received 
on Wednesday. We then sent out the demand.  On Friday, I spoke with Chuck, 
who had spoken with Jim Studdert, and I suggested that, with Jim's and your 
concurrence, Bob handle the matter along with the Glen Rice matter, since I 
fully expect that the defense/indemnity demand will be accepted and I suspect 
the same outside counsel will be appointed.  In the meantime, I called and 
spoke with the plaintiff's counsel re the service problem with CT and that we 
had only recently received notice of the suit.  He agreed on an answer date 
of May 1st, which I am hopeful will give enough time for the 
defense/indemnity situation to be resolved.  I have asked Lisa to draft a 
Rule 11 agreement re the extended answer date which will be sent out today, 
and I anticipate that you, Lisa, and Bob will handle the matter from here.

Please let me know if you have any questions re any of the above.  Thanks. 

 

Will this matter be going to Bob, as suggested?  Please advise.  Thanks,

Rob

Rob, in your absence, Bonnie White made demand on Morrison on Friday.  A copy 
will be forthcoming to you.  Monique provided a copy of the applicable COI.  
Sorry you were not kept in the loop.  Lisa

Monique, please recall you previously provided me with a copy of the Nepco 
contract with Morrison Construction for the Lincoln Center Peaker Power Plant 
in Manhattan, Illinois relative to the Gene Rice litigation.  It covered the 
time period of 2/1/00 - 2/1/01.  We know have a new lawsuit with a date of 
loss of 12/21/99.  Can you fax me ASAP a certificate of insurance covering 
that loss date, presumably 2/1/99-2/1/00, assuming Zurich was Morrison's 
carrier for the preceding time period as well.  We would like to sent out the 
attached demand letter ASAP, like we did in the Rice matter, so that 
hopefully Morrison picks up our defense.  Also, does anyone from Nepco have 
any details concerning this incident?  The Plaintiff claims to have slipped 
on muddy trailer steps while exiting one of the job trailers.

Thanks,

Rob Cole, Manager-Claims

 << File: Morrison.doc >> 

 

It is suggested that the above lawsuit be assigned to Bob Vote as its 
practically identical to the Gene Rice matter that we are currently handling 
together.  Like we did in that case, this matter should be tendered 
immediately to the plaintiff's employer, Morrison Construction, whose 
carrier, Zurich, assumed our defense and acknowledged us an additional 
insured.

It appears service occurred on 2/20/01, and that an Answer is due within 30 
days or by 3/22/01.  Please advise - thanks-

Rob

I know of no reason why we could not deliver this opinion.

In connection with a series of FASB 125 transactions, ENA will be entering 
into several swap transactions.  Also in connection therewith, Mark H. will 
be asked to deliver an opinion that there is no litigation which could impair 
ENA's ability to perform under the swaps.  Do you know of any reason why we 
could not deliver this opinion?  The opinion will be dated sometime on or 
prior to quarter end.

Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824. I am not  sure I want to 
coordinate that much, at least yet. Key Corp refused to wave conflict for 
several other firms and I still think I might be able to talk my way out of 
it. Do you think that if I went to Cleveland and talked to Schultes, perhaps 
with a business person, that we could get out?

Richard:
      I spoke to Healey last night about this.We arre in agreement that one 
lawyer should argue this and it should be a local lawyer. Healey's firm did 
the papers. Bob Steiner is a the most senior lawyer at that firm, is highly 
regarded, former Bar President and I would assume is well known to Moskowitz. 
As such this is acceptable to me, particularly with Healey providing the 
back-up. I suspect it was my call to Healey that prompted this e-mail.

for arguing the Stay motion. There were rolling blackouts in San Diego 
yesterday and the situation dominated the news. Because of unseasonably warm

We have been informed by the building management that our building is on the 
list for power shutdown today.  We are No. 13 and they currently are on No. 
9.  We don't know exactly when this will happen and we probably will not get 
further warning.  Most likely it will last about an hour.  Be sure to save 
computer work product frequently.  Shut your computer off if you are not 
going to use it  and try to close out of programs when not in use.

We should have continuation of phone service as there is  a backup battery.  
You should stay and work if you can, however, we will not have HVAC so if the 
air gets too bad you are free to leave via the stairwells.  Please check back 
after an hour with building security to see if the power has been restored.

Christian,

EPMI owes the PX a payment of approximately $25k this Friday for real-time 
charges for December.  It's the true-up payment (volume management calls it 
the "final" invoice).

Query:  Should we advise the PX to take the payment out of EPMI's collateral, 
like we did last time?  I told Brett "yes," subject to check with you.

Brett will wait to hear from you or me before he advises Houston.

Thanks,

Steve

I spoke to the head adjuster Sharron West this morning regarding this claim.  
She has discussed same with their chemist Bob Ash.

Sharron has reached some conclusions that are far different from the claim 
which was submitted to her.  From our conversation, the main differences seem 
to be:

1.  She is calculating the claim using the basis of valuation in the Philco 
contract.  That basis of valuation seems to coincide with your monthly 
storage declarations.   Your calculations appear to be based more on the spot 
price of the product. I believe the difference is around $.10 per lb which is 
very significant when so many lbs are involved.

2.  There appears to be a discrepancy in the number of pounds involved in the 
claim.  Baytank's records seem to indicate around 2,000,000 lbs. whereas your 
claim references approx. 6,000,000 lbs.   Both Sharron and Bob think that a 
maximum of 4,000,000 lbs. should be considered.

3.  Ancillary charges.  The Enron claim appears to include some Baytank 
charges that are not recoverable, such as tank cleaning, etc.  As a cargo 
policy normally insures against direct physical loss or damage to the product 
itself, there are some charges that are not recoverable under a cargo 
policy.   There also appear to be stock throughput charges in your claim 
through January of 2000, although the product would have been gone by the end 
of November.

At any rate,  based on the valuation of product in the Philco contract (and 
the storage declarations that have been submitted for premium purposes), and 
there being a total of 4,000,000 pounds of product, Sharron has calculateda 
claim in the vicinity of $150,000.  This is obviously a far cry from the 
claim submitted of around $900,000+.   Of course, if you consider a 
difference of $.10 /lb. and apply it to 4,000,000 lbs, you already have a 
difference of $400,000.  If you then factor in the difference between 
6,000,000 lbs claimed vs. 4,000,000 lbs. recognized by the adjusters, you 
have another significant sum.

I would be interested in your comments at this point.  If you feel that the 
adjuster has everything wrong, I might suggest that we arrange a meeting and 
go through the claim point by point. This is sometimes the quickedt way to 
resolve major differences.

Please let me know.

Thanks and regards,

Ted Rosen

Steve this is a classic example why  we have to push and push for progress 
and results.
There is no explicable reason why it can have taken this company so long to 
come up with this conclusion/report.
The discrepancies are very large and not having seen our claim I cannot judge.
The only way you are going to make progress is to get a meeting organised  
immediately and as Ted says go over it point by point. A $900,000 claim 
reduced to $ 150,000 is a serious issue .
From what I can gather from Ted Rosen's note is that  Baytank appear to admit 
to some form of liability/responsibility on the off spec which  I suppose is 
some progress.
I'm copying Graham on this now because he has plenty of experience in Europe 
with these claims .
This must be  sorted out and treated as high priority.
Call me to discuss
Thanks

I guess that we all expected such a reply from the Insurance company.  
Apparently we need to have a meeting to discuss the letter that I just 
received because I am very curious where all these numbers and information 
have come from.

1) What does a contract with Enron and  Philchem have to do with a cargo 
claim?  The product in the tank was owned by Enron and only Enron.  

2) On November 5th we discovered that the product was off-spec.  The 
beginning inventory that day was approx. 6.6mm pounds.  Where does 2mm pounds 
come from?

3) Baytank would not admit to a problem with the tank in which Enron is bound 
by contract.  Enron, under contract, is still obligated to pay costs 
assoiated with the tank.  In order for the tank to be used, it must be 
cleaned since it is considered off-spec.  Enron had nothing to do with the 
tank going off-spec and should be compensated for any and all out of costs 
and expenses incurred while the tank was considered off-spec.  

4) The tank agreement stipulates that a minimum of 3,104 mtons will be paid 
every month for thru-put no matter how much volume goes thru the tank.  
Again, Enron is bound by a contract and is still responsible for these costs 
until Baytank is proven at fault.

I just accepted approx. $250,000.00 settlement from the insurance company to 
cover part of our losses and expenses from the Styrene contamination.  I have 
been assured by the insurance company that this settlement will not hamper 
Enron in going after Baytank for additional funds.

Once I receive the paperwork on the settlement I will forward it on to 
Richard Sanders here at Enron.  The Insurance company has recommended a joint 
lawsuit to try and collect the remaining lost funds.  The insurance company 
will go after Baytank for the $250,000.00 as soon as possible.

We will still have roughly $500,000.00 on the books from last year.  

Looks good

Thanks,

We have no plans for the weekend of the 20th. Why not bring them all. We can 
get babysitters to help if we go out(which I am sure we will)
As for the Perd, we are definitely coming. I invited John and Yvonne but they 
cannot come. Doug and Susan may be coming. Someone needs to call Steve and 
Jane Ellen---would you do this. We will come Fri. morning.
p.s.---
I have read your explanation of when you are coming and what this Easter egg 
hunt is all about two times and I cannot make heads or tails of it.

for is April 20th and 21st. ?We are invited to both the rehearsal dinner and  
the wedding, which is at the Houstonian. ? 

With Maury's work schedule, I bet that he will be unable to make the dinner,  
so I need to decide if I am going to or not. ?But, we would like to come for  
the wedding. ?That is either asking you to help us with the kids...all of  
them, or ... helping us find enough sitters for them if you have plans. ? 
Steve has offered to keep Carolyn, and if we come just the night, I might do  
that. ??It is just a hard decision to make. ?She is still so young. 

Anyway, please see if this conflicts with anything. ?The other option would  
be to stay at John and Yvonne's....or leave the boys there...and Maury and I  
stay with Carolyn at the Houstonian. ?We do not want to impose....and I know  
that I am asking alot. 

Easter sounds good to us. ?There was a chance that Maury's sister was  
coming...but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes....so cancelled. ?We  
will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday. ? 
There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to. ?I 
think  
it will be at 1:00...so we will plan to be gone on that day. ?Which will 
give  
some breathing room for whoever is there. ?There is this huge egg hunt at 
the  
Episcopal Diosese...which is where Maury's mom works...and I hear it is  
better than any country club egg hunt. ?Just fun. ?So we will go there and  
come back for the night. 

When it gets closer we can coordinate some meals. ?I would be happy to  
grocery shop for everyone.....and split it down there. ?What do you feel 
like  
having. 

Anyway, I will talk with you later. 

Are you handling this?

This is the matter I have been working on for Enron Metals.  Enron Metals 
hired Pan Ocean as charterer.  Enron Metals needed to ship some metal from 
somewhere in Asia to Baltimore.  The ship was arrested in Hawaii in November 
and has not sailed since.  We are going to file an arbitration against Pan 
Ocean seeking to recover the damages we have suffered as a result of not 
being able to get our product to Baltimore.  Estimated damages: approx. $1 
million.  We hired Heallie & Baille back in January to assist (not Leroy).

I received an invoice this week from the Rockets for playoff tickets. We
need to make payment for the first two rounds by March 30 and decide whether
any credit should be refunded or applied to next year's tickets. The cost
for the first two rounds (which assumes 6 games) is $2,944. This calculation
is based on $944 for Round 1 (2 games with no home court advantage) and
$2000 for Round 2 (4 games assuming home court advantage). Based upon the
existing split, I need to collect the following amounts from each of you by
March 30:
Gage (25%): $736
Roten (25%): $736
Ballard (12.5%): $368
Doherty (12.5%): $368
Sanders (12.5%): $368
Eggleston (12.5%): $368
I suggest that any credit for unplayed games be applied to next year's
tickets. If anyone does not want playoff tickets or wants to opt out of next
year's tickets, let me know as soon as possible so I can make other
arrangements. Anyone not buying playoff tickets for the first two rounds
will not be entitled to buy tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 in the unlikely event
that the Rockets survive. By the way, tickets for Rounds 3 and 4 will cost
$4,976! Call me at 713/659-5100 with any questions. Max

I am traveling to LA on Tuesday and will not be back until late Wed. night.( 
Plus, your sister lives way the hell out of town) Any other time you are 
available? I'd love to show off my kids.

Can we talk about this when you have a second?

I spoke with Jim Studdert re this matter, and he advised that he believes 
that it may be covered at least in part by our insurance program.  He is 
forwarding it to our insurers for their review.  (I understand that he's 
never gotten a definitive answer re coverage in the other NSM matters, so 
that may end up being the case here.)  I will let you know when I hear 
anything further re a coverage determination.

NGX is covered - we continue to negotiate a commercial solution which will

The shaved head is Powell's deal - can you believe a guy shaving his head 
just to suck up for a promotion?

A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on 
behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we 
summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases 
as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside 
counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will 
need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have 
been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. 
Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have 
been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.

1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile ("Codelco" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG 
and MGCC

This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state 
copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but 
also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts 
on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the 
main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim 
from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, 
which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has 
NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.

Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document 
and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made 
subject to prior approval by legal.

Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 
5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, 
High Court proceedings take place in public.

2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation

Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client 
contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 
2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. 
Solicitors: Clyde & Co.

3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House

Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses 
believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as 
preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar 
inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with 
Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally 
(and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent 
offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to 
unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.

4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport  
LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)

Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being 
established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and 
have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent 
basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by 
Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume 
possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting 
advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become 
sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).

NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known 
to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.

5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse

Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME 
warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves 
significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in 
arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH 
(and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed 
the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

The draft Response looks good.

Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay.  As I do not yet have the US
Trustee's notice of appointment or a contact list, I did not have the
complete names of each of the members.  Please email those to me along with
your comments.

I would like to send the Response to Judge Smith this afternoon, if
possible, which means that it needs to be completed by 1:30.  Please forward
your comments by that time.  Sorry for the short fuse.

In addition, please send me your suggestions for counsel and for the agenda
items for the meeting on March 28, which will follow the hearing that starts
at 930 am.

good) securities class action plaintiffs firm. The John O'Quinn of LA---Tom 
Girardi-- is the plaintiffs' atty in the somewhat related gas cases. These

We argued the issue of additional document production this afternoon.
Morris took it under advisement.

The One Oak issue came up.  Morris said he had not realized it involved an
Enron entity.  He will stay away from it.  I assured him it was no problem.

He also disclosed that he had presented some award to Ken Lay recently at an
industry conference.  Smith assured him that was no problem either.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

The House of Lords have notified us that they will give their decision in the 
CATS litigation on Wednesday 4 April.  The decision is being handed down 
approximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.  Our counsel Jonathan 
Sumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:  
(1) he believes the Lords would not have had a suffficient amount of time to 
do the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning 
the Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the 
individual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a 
decision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not 
writing the decision in our case.  For these reasons, the likelihood of the 
ruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently 
likelihood of success at 60%.  Our team believes that the CATS parties are 
unlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.  Because we 
believe we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up 
value by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not 
make an offer of settlement.  

We expect to have a decision by 11:00 am London time on Wednesday;  judgement 
will be handed down formally at 2:00 pm that day.  I will make sure that each 
of you is contacted as soon as possible with the result.

There are no issues with making the litigation reps and warranties.

Jim-- Andy Edison is getting up to speed on the matters he did not already 
know about   We should be in a position to meet with you next week. I have 
also scheduled a meeting with you for next week to talk about NSM counsel and 
California.

Richard,

I am the new Financial Settlements Manager working for Kim Theriot.  In 
reviewing our Account Receivable
Report, we noticed an $ 8.7 million dollar (May 2000) unpaid receivable from 
Badak Gas Marketing, Inc.
The explanation I received on this is  that legal is negotiating a 
settlement.   Is this an accurate statement?
If yes,  what is the status?   Your assistance is this matter is deeply 
appreciated.

Regards,

Angelo Miroballi 

I am not sure why, but I would like a copy of the opinion--- probably for the 
same reason I slow down in my car to look at an accident.

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS 
litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties 
approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final 
figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the 
principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take 
as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part 
of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The 
opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended" 
rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that 
the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after 
payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are 
unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow 
J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and 
therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says 
that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature 
of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that 
the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The 
contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it 
is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the 
Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price 
reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This 
statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the 
opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties 
have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our 
submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the 
restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon 
which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point 
at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have 
been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our 
other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and 
describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  
Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country 
(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for 
recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or 
expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from 
each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster 
ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in 
fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if 
you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

As many of you probably know by now, our chargeback case is scheduled for 
next week's FERC agenda.  Thus, if its not too late already, it is imperative 
that we file our answer to the PX's answer ASAP.  In this regard, no party 
filed a reply yesterday in opposition to the PX's motion to the bankruptcy 
court to lift the automatic stay.  It is my understanding that a proposed 
order is circulating among applicable bankruptcy counsel.  If all counsel 
sign today, the PX intends to file it with the court tomorrow and we could 
conceivably get an order from the court tomorrow modifying the stay.

I am advised, however, that if not all counsel are available to sign the 
proposed order today, the PX intends to simply file the proposed order with 
the court tomorrow.  In this event, under local rules, the court must wait 
seven days before entering an order modifying the stay.  Of course, this will 
be after FERC's meeting next week.

Assuming that an order is not issued tomorrow, the question for the group is 
whether we should file our answer tomorrow in any event.  The theory would be 
that since the debtor itself sought to modify the stay so as to permit 
litigation of the chargeback proceeding to continue, no party opposed the 
motion, and the debtor filed a proposed order with the court to modify the 
stay, any violation of the automatic stay would be technical at best, and 
unlikely to be raised by the PX in the bankruptcy proceeding.  (This argument 
would be enhanced if the PX requests the court, when it eventually enters its 
order, to do so retroactively to April 6).

I would like to hear from the parties (including bankruptcy counsel) whether 
they endorse or oppose this approach.  Thanks.  Ron

P.S.  if you are aware of any members of our group that have been left off 
this email, please let me know.

Sounds good

 Charlie Tetrault called me today to make sure we were aware of one more 
billing issue arising out of the above-referenced cases.  A little chronology 
may help.

 Until around October or November of last year, V&E's bills solely referenced 
the Grynberg II case.  Afterwards, due to Northern having removed the case, 
V&E's bills included a seperate category for Quinque time.  Starting in 
January of 2000, however, V&E's bills (the first one being for December time) 
introduced a third category for  "Joint Defense Work" time.  This third 
classification represented work done by V&E on the proposed Quinque motion to 
dismiss for lack of standing, etc.(but not for lack of personal jurisdiction, 
which briefing is being done by Fulbright).  Basically, V&E, Skadden and one 
other firm are putting together the draft motion to dismiss for lack of 
standing, etc.  Substantially all that work has already been done, according 
to Charlie.  The expectation was that, e.g., Enron would pay V&E's fees up 
front, Sonat would pay Skadden's bills up front, etc., then all those who 
"fronted" such fees would recover those payments from other members of the 
joint defense committee, who would be billed pro rata.

 What Charlie called me to say is that if we have EOG pay 50% of the Joint 
Defense Work time category, then the Holland & Hart trustee who eventually 
makes reimbursement will have to deal with an additional level of complexity 
in determining how the reimbursements will be made.  Charlie really left it 
up to us as to what we want to do; we just need to make sure that everyone 
(including, I guess, Holland & Hart) understands that EOG will be one of the 
ones "fronting" the money to V&E and entitled to receive reimbursement.  One 
the other hand, I got the impression that Charlie would appreciate it if 
Enron paid 100% of the Joint Defense Billing (and accordingly got 100% of any 
reimbursement), so that the reimbursement issue was not so complicated

 Frankly, I would not be surprised if Barry starts reconsidering the 50/50 
split after he sees these most recent bills, given that the Jont Defense 
Billing is exclusively for Quinque work.  

 My thought is not to change how we pay the 50/50 split on the bills we have 
already received, but advise V&E that for future bills, they can bill Enron 
100% of the Joint Defense Billing category.

 Please let me know how you all feel about this.

        B.K.D.

It is important that we get this information ASAP so we can bill East Coast 
Power for your time.

Mr. Sanders, as you now have the privilege of handling our litigation, I am 
looking for your recommendation on how to staff this from a litigation point 
of view will someone in your group or the Corp litigation unit do the 
courtroom work?

FYI, Bob Vote helped us on the prior garnishment on EECC filed by Dennis 
Delewski against CIGSA, did a fine job, and knows the players, and I would be 
glad to have his help again. Please us know what you would like to do. 

Randy Pais will work it from within EEOS legal. 

I have not yet notified Jim Derrick, thinking that either you or Mark might 
want to. I am quite happy to call him if you like.

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

I would be shocked if HH did not have insurance for the line repairs. We 
should ask their atty about this.

I spoke to Steve and Gerald  about this last week.  On the monies they owed 
us under the gas lift contract, we gave them until May 10th to respond or we 
would institute litigation.  The attorney for HH, Jim Williams, called me 
last week and basically laid it out that HH sold all of its assets to White 
Oak back in December (and we already had been so informed by White Oak), that 
HH doesn't have any assets left and we could go after the principals if we 
wanted but they probably wouldn't even file an answer and we could just get a 
judgment and renew it every ten years for as long as we pleased.  He offered 
a flat settlement amount of $15,000 on our claim of $35,284.95.  Steve has 
given me the authority to accept the offer but after doing so will ask about 
settling the $11,000.00 claim for the line repairs.  Quite honestly, I don't 
hold out much hope of HPL recovering anything more than $15,000 but that is 
$15,000 more than we have right now.  Also, since Gerald was working on the 
gas lift debt, I've asked him to notify credit and put HH and its principals 
on the credit risk list so that we don't do any more deals with them.

As I recall, we were trying to muscle HH into paying that invoice for line

adamant denial of liability and refusal to pay?  It's really not enough money 
to go to court over.

Pls advise.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Thanks for your e-mail. Since I talked to Jim, I have been sucked into the 
California energy crisis and am not concentrating on the workouts just yet. I

You will receive this service of process today. I have already spoken with 
Sam Gaufin, Crown Energy's counsel, re the subpoena served on us by MCNIC.  
ENA holds preferred stock in Crown Energy, but, as I understand from talking 
with Dan Lyons, we don't consider it to really have any value.  In any event, 
I will make sure that Sam knows what we are producing before it is produced, 
and I have made arrangements for a protective order with respect to any Enron 
confidential information (although thus far I have seen only a little that 
would fall into that category).  Let me know if you have any 
questions/comments.

The following documents, received today, have been forwarded for your 
immediate attention:

On my way back to the job site after a meeting in Dever, with Rooney
Engineering. I received a call on my cell phone from Mike White site manager
for NEPCO telling me a OSHA compliance officer was on the job site. Mike J.
Mc Williams, Mike White, and I walked the site, looked at all records and
spoke with NEPCO, CIGC and Jomax personnel. MR. Mcwilliams and I had a close
out interview meeting after the inspection. He said the job site and records
were in order and no major violation were seen with the accident or the job
site. His only comment was he saw a missing clip on a out-boom. He will issue
a report on his inspection within 6 months.
Accident reports from NEPCO, Jomax and CIGC will be forward to your office on
Thursday March 29, 2001. If you or your offfice need addtional infor. please
let know.

Jerry Odom

I gave this to Gail to handle. She in turn is getting Bob Vote to handle. In

EECC has just been served with a writ of garnishment from the 333rd Judicial 
District Court of Harris County  in connection with a judgment against 
certain CIGSA entities. In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very 
plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to 
CIGSA pending further orders from  the court. The writ was issued to enforce 
an judgment  for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of 
Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list 
all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,  and to 
disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or 
assets.  The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully 
garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment 
creditors. 

Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be 
entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where 
the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or 
Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more 
accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY 
payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any 
CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may 
impose penalties for violations  of its garnishment order.

We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy 
Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and 
Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control 
teams on  this matter ASAP.

I gave you what I thought were 4 copies of this pleading yesterday and sent

looking for your recommendation on how to staff this from a litigation point 
of view will someone in your group or the Corp litigation unit do the

FYI, Bob Vote helped us on the prior garnishment on EECC filed by Dennis

glad to have his help again. Please us know what you would like to do.

Procurement Company. 

The advice below applies in full with respect to these entities.

John:

Please give further advise as how to operate down here in Tampico. We are in 
the middle of (3) Projects, where we (Enron/Cigsa) have commitments to pay 
out that are project related:
Labor
Labor Taxes
Materials
Consumables
Import Duties
Miscellaneous
Payment for Transportation of Structures (Barge/Tug)

The funds to pay the above are in CIGSA Construccion's name, although I am 
one of the two authorized signatures in the bank, and no funds can be moved 
unless I sign a check.

What is the impact of the below message on the above categories?

Also, what about when we CIGSA/Enron/ODB (CAByL) receive payments? CIGSA 
invoices CAByL and then the money is wired to Enron. What is the impact on 
this?

Please advise as soon as possible.

California hits a new low.

Wednesday, April 11, 2001 12:15 PM

<!--TEXT-->

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a
reward of more than $50 million to anyone who has information that will help 
his
office prosecute power suppliers accused of gouging the wholesale electricity
market in the state.

Lockyer's Energy Emergency Task Force has been conducting an investigation for
several months into allegations that generators and natural gas marketers have
engaged in "any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction in the
California (electricity) supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or
electricity."

"My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into whether energy
providers have violated any laws," Lockyer said. "It is possible that one or
more members of the public can help with information, and if so, the financial
reward to such a person or persons could be enormous."

Gov. Gray Davis earmarked $4 million of state funds so Lockyer's office can
investigate claims of collusion, profiteering, price gouging and other
anticompetitive behavior on the part of generators.

Generators such as Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) have
vehemently denied the claims, saying their behavior in the wholesale 
electricity
market has already been investigated by federal regulators and various state
agencies, all of whom have concluded that the companies did not violate any
antitrust laws.

Recently, however, the California Independent System Operator, manager of the
state's electricity grid, concluded a study that found the same companies
overcharged California $6 billion for electricity during part of 2000 and 
early
2001.

Generators said the high prices are due to an imbalance in supply and demand 
in
the state and the high price of natural gas.

The ISO has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order generators
to refund the money to the state's utilities. FERC agreed, but gave generators
the benefit of the doubt and asked the companies to substantiate their
electricity prices or refund the money.

Lockyer, whose investigation has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, according to a
spokeswoman in his office, is now seeking a whistleblower.

"Anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of a
false claim action may be entitled to percentage share in the award," Lockyer
said. "Since billions of dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant
could potentially range from $50 million to the hundreds of millions of 
dollars."

Davis has frequently referred to out-of-state generators as "greedy 
profiteers"
and one Sacramento lawmaker has introduced legislation that would place a
windfall profits tax on sales of electricity generators earn in the state's
wholesale market.

Lockyer said the state should not be left holding the bag for "greedy business
decisions of generators, marketers and utilities" adding that he will seek
criminal and civil penalties if his investigation finds that generators gouged
the wholesale electricity market.

"Justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the
expense of California pay back what they owe."

Attached please find an electronic copy of a memorandum that I prepared this 
week in connection with the claim by International Gas Limited ("IGL") 
against Enron Exploration Company ("EEC").  The claim appears to relate to 
the recent execution of an upstream gas development "Term Sheet" in 
connection with Project Dolphin, and certain rights IGL believes it has to 
participate in the benefits of such Term Sheet pursuant to a May 18, 1994 
Agreement that was executed between IGL and EEC in connection with Enron's 
earlier Qatar LNG Project.

I understand from discussions the other day with Bob Williams and Don 
Wendland of EOG Resources Inc. ("EOG") that EOG will in all likelihood ask 
Pettman Smith (IGL's counsel in London) for an extension of the requested 
April 16 response date.

If you have any questions or comments on this memorandum, or if I can be of 
further assistance in connection with this claim, please do not hesitate to 
call on me.

Kind regards,
Dan

 Can either of you guys help me answer the non-India portions of the attached 
memo?  Thanks in advance. 
Dear Suhas,
Attached is a list of things to be done in the G.C. Singh WP, which I have 
listed as "Queries". The information sought on "Pakistan", "Teeside" and 
"California" is only by way of background material and NOT for the purposes 
of setting out in the reply. According to me, those are wholly irrelevant. It 
is just that they have been raised and hence some background knowledge may be 
provided. It would help if there are any blatant false / misleading 
statements by the Petitioner regarding the three supra. The other things 
mentioned are required for me to finalise the Reply.
Please note that my e-mail address has changed to

Richard,
 I have been working with Jeff Richter to solve some of the issues
concerning the bid data and questions that have arisen about the outcome
information we have already turned over to the experts.  Based upon a
conversation that I had with Jeff this morning, I believe it makes sense for
me to meet with Jeff in Portland to try and solve some of these problems.  I
want to avoid creating multiple databases and both Jeff and I believe it
will be easier to resolve these issues with both the people and the
information at his fingertips.  I am also scheduled to meet with the
Portland General traders on Wednesday to do the audit of their trading
practices as we discussed when we were both last in Portland.  I also plan
to spend a few minutes with Tim Belden to learn what additional information
he might have about my understanding of the trading practices.  If you need
more details, please let me know.

 Hope you had a pleasant 3 day weekend.

Thanks
Gary

Richard,
 I contacted Al Alexanderson at Portland General as you suggested to
set up a meeting with the Portland General traders to learn about their
trading strategies.  This will probably happen some time next week.  In my
discussion with Al, they have taken the approach of creating a supply stack
for all of their OOM and bids over $150 and are applying a most expensive
first approach to establishing cost basis for FERC and other requests.  I
think it makes sense to look at what they have done and see how their
proposal would work on EPMI data and vice versa.  Do you concur?

Thanks

Hi Richard,

I wanted to discuss with you two open items with you re: our voice recorder 
policy.

On the authorization to listen to conversations, we cannot comply with the 
requirement that an MD authorize it because we have no MD on site.  Given the 
size of our office, etc. I can suggest some people that would be appropriate 
in lieu of an MD.  Insofar as who should be present, we are suggesting that 
the IT person be present to run the playback, together with myself and the 
person who authorized the playback.

On the retention policy, the policy presently applicable is fine for most of 
our personnel.  One of our companies, Enron Trading Services Inc. is 
regulated by the CFTC and the NFA, who impose a 5 year records keeping 
requirement.  We can purchase a separate system for the traders in that 
company for a cost of about $20,000.  

Please let me know when you will have a moment to discuss.

Thanks,

 Starting on Thursday,  April 19, at 2:00 p.m. there will be a weekly 
telephone conference for the California litigation team.  The objective will 
be to identify key issues and plan a coordinated strategy for all litigation 
in California.  The call will last not more than one hour.  

 Thus far, the responsibility has been allocated as follows:

1. PG&E Bankruptcy   Lisa Mellencamp and Carl Ecklund (LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & 
McRae)

2. Class Actions   Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs (Gibbs & Bruns)

3. CTC Matters   Bob Williams, Mike Day and Gary Fergus (Brobeck)

4. FERC Matters    Regulatory and Richard Sanders and Dan Watkiss (Bracewell

5. Government Investigations Regulatory and Richard Sanders

 Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs will have overall responsibility for 
coordination of the litigation.

Richard -

Please let me know if you are on board with Enron Europe's proposal.  Thanks.

Hello Robert and Rob,

I thought I would respond to a few of the issues which were raised in 
Robert's email of March 23rd regarding the email retention policy. 
The overall policy which seems to be now agreed to for European emails 
appears below.  

INBOX- Deletion after 30 days
SENT deleted after 30 days- ( now confirmed that once in folder, it will not 
be deleted s.t comments below)
TRASH- 15 days( same as policy )
FOLDERS- moved to archives/ livelink via OUTLOOK after 365 days after being 
in folder
ARCHIVES 6 years (livelink or Ivault)

However while the above time limits have been 'agreed', IT have also been 
developing project OMNI which as I understand it will replace Lotus Notes 
with Outlook.  The implementation of Outlook, involves limiting the amount of 
email stored ( both in your inbox and the folders) to 100Mb before it is 
removed from the folder or inbox and over into an archiving system 
(hopefully). This technical limitation (100Mb) may or may not clash with the 
day limitations we have proposed above, depending on the amount of emails one 
receives and the type of attachments which are in the emails themselves. The 
ultimate interaction between the technical parameters (100Mb) together with 
the time limitations (number of days) will have to be worked out. 

With respect to the issue of recycling and back up tapes, once we have a 
reliable archive system in place we can move to eliminate the back up tapes 
for received emails and recycle them in a similar fashion to Houston. However 
it should be noted that whatever archive system we decide to use, whether it 
be livelink, Ivault or some other system, we will also have some sort of back 
up system for the archive whether it be tapes or through some other type of 
mechanism.

I have spoken with a few of the IT people on our end and we will be having 
meetings to ensure that we are all of the same mind when it comes to the 
implementation of this policy. Hopefully this addresses a few of the concerns 
which were expressed. If anyone has any further comments, concerns or 
questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me at 0207 783 4084.

Kind Regards,

Ian Brungs

You sent me a note yesterday asking what has happened to the Robert Burns 
matter (the $11 million invoice).  I have talked to Mr. Burns' lawyer and 
told him -- in essence -- that he is crazy and that we don't intend to pay 
his client a dime.  We'll just have to sit back and wait and see if a lawsuit 
is filed.

Texas fights Davis' claim of banditry
By James Rosen
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published Sept. 2, 2001)
HOUSTON  --  All summer long, the corporate barons of Energy Alley have listened to Californians castigate them as greedy gougers with friends in high places, and they've about heard an earful.
Instead of sailing the seas in brigantines, the Texas power merchants targeted as "profiteers and pirates" by Gov. Gray Davis ply their trade from atop glass masts along Louisiana Street in downtown Houston.
"We are proud of what we've done in California to help keep the lights on," Joe Bob Perkins, president of wholesale business for Reliant Energy, said in his 47th-floor office. "We've run our plants at record levels. We invested four times more in 2000 than we did in 1998. Reliant certainly didn't withhold power. We did everything we could to make it available. We made more money because we sold more electricity."

Gail Brownfeld has assumed responsibility for the case. She will contact you.

Bob Crane indicated that you were handling the litigation for this counterparty.  Can you let me know what the status is?

Thanks,
Tanya

George-- are you ok for the 8yh?

	I haven't heard back from George yet.  I'll confirm with him. It's set as far as Brobeck and I are concerned. 

I have to move some stuff around on the 8th. Is that set in stone?

	Are you available for a call with George and I this afternoon?  George, what works for you? 

The 8th is fine. Mel knows he never responded since I have raised that with
him three times. George we need your help with Seth. I was in Washington
today and they are not ready on damages although they were supposed to be. I
am going to meet them again on Friday to drive this foward. They need
additional information from you and maybe a pep talk. I have already tried
to impress on them the urgency of the situation.

I saw your picture in the paper today as ( I think) a "woman of distinction." Congrats.

Thanks for the direction.  EES also has a claim, separate and apart from
the claim described in my orignial email. EES's claim was in the $5 million
range and they've already gotten a distribution in the $700,000. Thanks and
hope you're doing ok and not doing as much traveling.

Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com on 09/24/2001 09:55:24 AM
Yes-- deal with Willie directly. As for the claim of 1.825 million, as long
as ENA accounting agrees to that #, I am fine. Is that just ENA or does EES
also have a claim?

   Hello!

   It was nice to see you at the POS event last week.  I can't believe that
   we're into a new school year. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch; we did
   a
   fair amount of traveling this summer and now I'm over my head preparing
   for
   a trial that begins mid-October.

   I assume/hope that you did receive a payment from the PCA trustee on
   account of EPMI's allowed claim.  If you didn't, shame on me for not
   following up.  If you need me to, please just let me know.

   The only other open matter I have for ENA is in the Perry Gas case in
   which
   ENA filed a proof of claim in the amount of about $1,918,000.  A plan of
   liquidation has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the
   anticipated
   (not guaranteed) payout over time is expected to be in the 55-60% range.
   The post-confirmation trustee is in the process of reconciling claims.

   From the email below sent to my from the post-liquidation trustee's
   counsel
   (who was also counsel to Perry Gas during the bankruptcy case), it
   appears
   that the trustee's accounting people have been talking to Willie Stewart
   in
   accounting at ENA to try to reconcile the slightly different numbers.

   From what I understand, Willie Stewart and Perry agree that, with the
   exception of $78,337.16 that ENA owed Perry  for August 1999 deliveries,
   the amount of the prepetition claim is $1,903,490.72.   Provided that
   there
   is no disagreement about the amount of unpaid sales from Perry to ENA
   for
   August 1999, the $78,337.16 should be offset against the $1,903,490.72
   claim, which would leave ENA with a prepetition claim of $1,825,153.56.

   I would be happy to deal directly with Willie on this if you'd like --
   just
   let me know.  If Willie agrees with the $78,337.16 amount due to Perry
   for
   August 1999, do I have authority to agree to the prepetition claim of
   $1,825,153.56?  Perry has made one distribution and I'll get the
   commitment
   up front that as soon as the agreed order allowing ENA's claim, Perry
   will
   cut a check for the first distribution.

   If my case settles, I'll give you a call to set up a lunch.  I'd like to
   get caught up.  Thanks and take care.

FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW
  
09/24/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday. 
"I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market," concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case. 
The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said. 
"Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on," Cintron said. 
Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region. 
"The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers," the judge said. 
The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case. 
     
At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001. 
In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. 
The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December. 
Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission. 
"Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market," Cintron concluded. "This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner." 
"Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard," Cintron said. 
California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million). 
Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds. 
Cintron was persuaded by the "ripple" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds. 
"Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task," Cintron said. 
"The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market," the judge said. 
"Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale," she said. 
The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed. 
In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market. 
While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices. 
Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Andy Edison is handling and he will respond.

Wanted to see what is going on with this lawsuit.  Just saw another slug of bills come in for $60,000.

Any update????

You have it in hand--as I knew you would. Adkin's atty is supposed to call me at 9:30. you may want to call him today to let him know not to call me.

	Richard,

	This will acknowledge receipt today of and thank you for the above-referenced new matter and accompanying file.  I have reviewed that file and spoken about it with Stacy.  In brief, this is an as-yet-unfiled claim for breach of a gas supply contract and $336,832.17 in damages by the seller, Franklin Adkins, against ENA, as the buyer.  

	Adkins' claim is based on breach of an index price contract that had been assigned to ENA from Columbia Energy Services Corporation.  ENA contends that this index price contract had been terminated and replaced with a ENA Enfolio fixed price contract, and that ENA accordingly owes Adkins nothing.  All this is, of course, subject to further investigation, including whether ENA may have a counterclaim against Adkins for overpayment.

	I will contact the key witnesses tomorrow and find out as much as I can about the matter before speaking with Adkin's attorney on Friday at 9:30 a.m.  Please let me know who else I should be reporting to besides you and Stacy.  I assume that you will be handling this, rather than Andy Edison, unless you instruct me otherwise.

	As always, I appreciate the referral and the chance to work with you and Stacy.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt 

Randy Pais at Enron is handling. You are right that all of this is confidential. I don't think we want anyone to know that we are asking for a permit and the selling the site. By the way, we have no buyer.Randy has your name if he needs anyone in Memphis. Nice to hear from you.

Richard:
 
This  is the e-mail message that I mentioned to you yesterday.  Thanks for your  help.  Take care.
 
Peter
 
 
Richard Sanders of Enron called me  yesterday morning.  He said that Enron is  selling the Arlington "plant" even before construction begins.  In other  words, Enron is selling the land, the permit applications, some turbines and  other equipment, and the technology for building the plant.  Richard said  that he would try to confirm this information by speaking to the in-house Enron  attorney who is handling this project.  This is probably confidential  information, so I suggest that you not disclose it outside the firm.  I  will attempt to obtain the name of the buyer so as to determine whether we may  be in a position to provide services to that entity.   Thanks.

Knox thinks any settlement will be between 1-2 million,probably closer to 2. What business person, if any, should we talk to about this? With Carrin, Neal M. and Knox, the attys fees will be enormous if this case ever gets going again.

I assume JVD will not overpay.  In my view $1mm would be grossly overpaying.
I had lunch with Ronnie Krist and he will settle if the money gets right.
He said it should be easier with no class, to work something out  since he
now has a case with only 87 plaintiffs.  Our earlier offer of I believe
$400,000 won't do it.  It will probably take more than $1,000,000 in an
offer to get a real number from Ronnie.  He also observed that it will be
interesting to see what happens to the make up of the Supreme Court.

Chris Ferrazzi Bill Wiggins and Gene Nettles want to play golf with you at Champions!  I told them a weekday would probably be most palatable.  Please let me know if you are interested and if so what time and days would work for you.  Thanks. 

I am willing to allow our name as a cc. Let me know and I will call her back.
Richard and Lisa-
The watered down letter to SCE is set out below.  Let me know if you have
any comments and if Enron is willing to sign on to the letter.  We are
trying to get this out today.  Dynegy has watered this down somewhat, but I
believe has signed off on it.  Mirant has also agreed.

Also, Gov Davis's proclamation on XXX Session is set out below.  October 9

The State Enron Records to Stay Secret Court: A judge orders confidentiality for the power firm's documents. A Senate panel probing electricity price gouging has subpoenaed them.

SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp., the giant Texas-based seller of electric power, won a court ruling Thursday in its quest to guarantee the secrecy of hundreds of thousands of internal business documents sought by state lawmakers. 
A Senate committee investigating price gouging in California's wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enron's documents in April, seeking records of electricity sales, bidding strategies, prices and out-of-state transactions.
The company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records. Enron sued July 11, and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C. Kobayashi granted the company's request for a protective order. 
The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of the California Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of the state's two largest utilities last January. 
"Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition with plaintiff," wrote Kobayashi, "the functions of the Senate and the Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict, actual conflicts can arise." 
Kobayashi's order is a reversal of an earlier, tentative ruling, in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be an "unacceptable" intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the Legislature. 
Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based company, described executives as "very pleased" with the court ruling. "Turning over the documents was never the issue," she said, "The issue was always protecting our rights." 
Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides, Denne said. 
Reliant Energy of Houston, another company that resisted demands for business records, on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with Dunn's committee and will begin bringing 250,000 documents to a depository in Sacramento, said Reliant spokesman Marty Wilson. 
Dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to Sacramento, but not all are fully complying with subpoenas. 
"There are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market participants," he said. 
On July 21, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market voted to recommend that Enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents. 
The full Senate has yet to vote on that recommendation. 
The committee, which the Senate created in March, has focused its investigation on the private companies that purchased power plants after California moved to deregulate its electricity market in 1996.

California judge says no to Enron subpoena
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Enron Corp. received a protective order Thursday for documents subpoenaed by a California state Senate committee. 
Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi ruled that Houston-based Enron can prevent the legislative panel from sharing information in the thousands of documents relating to energy trading in California. 
"Once the confidential information is disclosed, no amount of sanctions will be able to rectify the damage that might be caused," Kobayashi wrote in his order. 
The Senate committee requested documents including e-mails, phone logs, financial records and records of any Enron "trading strategies." The panel is probing whether generators manipulated the power market. 

Enron Wins Document Protection Order From Calif Judge

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Sacramento Superior Court judge Thursday ruled that Enron Corp (ENE) must comply with a legislative subpoena of financial documents, but reversed an earlier decision and granted the company a protective order of the documents, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Dow Jones Newswires.
Enron said the ruling was a victory, as the company has always maintained it would be happy to comply with the subpoena by the state Senate committee as long as the company received a protective order. 
"We are obviously very happy with the ruling and look forward to working with the committee to come up with a protective order that truly protects our proprietary information," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Senate Select Committee To Investigate Market Manipulation has already cited Enron and Reliant Energy, Inc (REI) with contempt for refusing to provide documents, a charge for which the companies could be fined. 
Once Enron and the committee draft a protective order and the judge agrees to it, the company will hand over any documents that the committee wants, Palmer said. 
However, an attorney for the committee expressed skepticism that the company would actually follow through. 
"We have no indication from Enron that they would agree to produce the documents we've requested, even with the confidentiality order," said Larry Drivon, special counsel to the committee. 
He added that he could not speculate if the committee would drop its contempt charge if Enron did produce all requested documents. 
In his decision granting the protective order, Judge Charles Kobayashi wrote that he was not convinced the committee has solid standards in place to ensure Enron's protection. 
"It is clear that there are no standards for determining what are the available protections, no procedure for determining what is a legitimately confidential, privileged, proprietary matter, no procedure for oversight and no prescribed remedy for (Enron) for any unauthorized disclosures," Kobayashi wrote. 
Last week, a San Francisco Superior Court judge granted Enron a protective order in a separate investigation by the state attorney general.

USA: Enron must give documents to Calif. lawmakers-judge.

09/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the state's energy crisis, a California judge ruled on Thursday. 
But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement, saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firm's right to maintain proprietary secrets.
"If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest, then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights, attorneys to surrender their attorney-client privilege, (and) psychiatrists to surrender their privileges," the judge wrote. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity during the state's energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold. 
Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its industries. 
An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents, but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets, for example, would be protected under a confidentiality agreement. 
The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. 
"We are pleased with the judge's order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected," Denne said. "The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents." 
The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc. for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents. It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since 1929, but has not yet come up for a vote. 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. however, avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements, open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents there relating to the company's recent business in California. 
Sacramento judge says committee must protect Enron documents

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation of wholesale energy prices, a judge ruled Thursday, but the state must give the energy company a confidentiality agreement. 
Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said in his ruling that he wasn't convinced that the Senate committee "will be able to maintain the petitioner's right to confidentiality."
The Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market subpoenaed documents from six energy companies as they investigated last year's price spikes in the wholesale electricity market. 
If the committee went forward without a confidentiality agreement, Kobayashi said, it could then require the same of newspapers, attorneys or psychiatrists. 
Enron's motion to quash the subpoenas were dismissed last week and the judge reaffirmed that ruling Thursday. Another Enron motion seeking an injunction against the committee will be heard Wednesday. 
Company spokeswoman Karen Denne called the protective order ruling a victory. "This gives us the confidentiality agreement we've been seeking." 
The order's specifics will be worked out with Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee chairman. It will then be signed by a judge, once both sides agree. 
Enron officials have offered to turn over 25,000 documents that were already in California, but refused to comply with the rest of the subpoena. 
The committee found Enron in contempt for not turning over all the requested documents. A full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full Senate, which has not voted on it. A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. 
A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

Privileged and Confidential

Gail,

I had a productive conversation with Keith Dutill, the Stradley lawyer who
I've known for decades and who is now representing York Paper.

The short of it is that he said he is very interested in trying to resolve
this before the litigation machinery cranks up.  He will discuss it with his
client and get back to me.  He said that York has "strong feelings" and then
agreed with me that Enron feels the same way.  He felt that York has a "good
business sense" and would be interested in reaching a compromise without
spending a lot of dollars in legal fees.

Dutill does not know why two separate summons were filed in Delaware County.
It's his understanding that the claims against Enron are largely the same as
the claims against Holzer (with perhaps one or two exceptions that still
relate to Holzer's employment with Enron).  He is working on a complaint
that will cover both summons, and expects to file it in the next several
weeks, certainly before the mediation conference on November 19th.  I said
that we should try to start our own discussions before that mediation
conference so that the mediator could focus on any areas of disagreement.

Here's how Dutill described York's claims:  Holzer worked for York Paper.
When Holzer left York, York wanted to prevent Holzer from working for Enron.
Holzer wanted to work for Enron, and so did Enron, so there was some
"agreement" between Holzer/Enron and York.  In that "agreement", Holzer and
Enron made "promises" about the way they "would do business" with York.  It
appears that the promise was that Holzer and Enron would not bypass York
Paper and deal directly with York Paper's customers.  Yet, according to
Dutill, that is what Holzer and Enron did -- cut out York Paper as the
middle man.  This has resulted in a "fair erosion of business" for York
Paper.  It is "not just a matter of subsequent solicitation."  It also
involves "interference with existing contracts" between York and its
customers. 

So, it would seem that York's claims might include breach of contract,
interference with contractual relations and, perhaps,
misrepresentation/fraud.  Interestingly, he did not mention any of the West
Coast and Garden State Paper contracts we have been looking into.

If you have any thoughts, please let me know.  I will keep you informed of
any further developments.

Give me the name and number if you have it of the knee doctor.  My knee's are really getting bad.  They really hurt when I go up the stairs.

If you are in yor office, Give me a call. I have lost your telephone #

Thx. I'll wait and see

not much to report.  the other defendants apparently have yet to come to ground on a final settlement agreement.  i spoke with one of the principal drafters today, who sounded frustrasted and would report only that they "are still working on it."  she also withdrew her colleague's prior indication that there was one thing we would be able to know once they settled.  she was quite firm that the confidentiality provisions were all encompassing, with no carve-outs.

neither we nor they have heard a word from the court. when the last hearing was cancelled, it was left that the court would give the parties some time to work out a settlement and then would schedule a status conference to figure out who was in/out, and how to proceed.

if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me.

From those that have responded (Scott, Mike, and Richard) it looks like October 17 or October 19 are the two best days.  There are still spaces available! 

Chris Ferrazzi Bill Wiggins and Gene Nettles want to play golf with you at Champions!  I told them a weekday would probably be most palatable.  Please let me know if you are interested and if so what time and days would work for you.  Thanks. 

I am not sure why you want to go, but of course you can. Just show up.

This is BS.  I am not invited to the energy seminar b/c I am not an AGC.  It sounds like something I could learn from.  Can you help me?
I realized that you were not on the list after I sent the e-mail.  I asked about it and was told that it is only for asst. gen. counsel and above.  

Wait--was Gail invited and I was not?  

Robert Williams

We are compiling a list of the Enron employees involved with project "Notre Dame". Please e-mail me (suzanne.vann@enron.com) a list of the people in your group who have been informed of this transaction. If you have any questions, you may call my cell phone: 713-857-6235.

Please send a copy to Bob Williams. He will handle.

Richard, Andy, 

Ted has been served with a Notice to Produce Documents in litigation between Fred Greenberg (plaintiff) and the Corp board of directors (attached below). The docs Ted is required to produce relate to benefits he may have received from a number of Enron related finance entities in his capacity as Representative of those entities. 

I presume this request can be dealt with entirely in Houston and substantially without Ted's involvement (?). I'd be grateful if you could confirm what the process will be for dealing with this and what input, if any, you will require from Ted. 

Thanks

Gail,

One of Dechert's transactional lawyers has been asked to represent Kaiser
Aluminum in a derivatives transaction in which Enron Metals is on the other
side.  We do not believe that this would impair in any way our ability to
represent Enron and its other subsidiaries in the York matter.  I wanted,
however, to bring it to your attention in case you have any concerns.
Please let me know that this is ok.  Thanks, and sorry to bring this up at

Bonnie White can help you.

Richard -

I have a small contract matter involving Enron Credit that requires a settlement agreement.

Basically, EC orally agreed to have a third party develop and host a website that would provide the EC information to site subscribers.  These subscribers might also be subscribers to other products promoted by the third party.  The written agreement backing up the oral agreement was due to be finalized on Friday of last week, but, as you can imagine was not actually signed.

As EC is not pursuing its business at this time, it has asked to terminate the relationship with this third party - a termination that will cost $96K.

I have been asked to do a settlement agreement and was wondering if there is any particular form that Enron uses or that you may have for this type of deal.  It is rather simple in nature, but we do want to make sure that all necessary release language is included.

Thanks.

Mark

I can't see how this could be related to our battles with the AG over trading issues in CA. I have no concerns.

Dave and Dean, I am forwarding the email to Richard Sanders.  Richard, this is FYI.  The Calif. State Atty Gen'l's office wanted to see the land use application in connection with our project development efforts in Lodi, CA.  We don't understand why that office would be interested.  If you have any concerns, please let me know; also, if we learn more about this, we will let you know.
 
Christian, this is FYI re your California trading matters, in case this might be relevant.
 
Kenton
 

Why don't we let richard Sanders know about this.  I agree with Kenton that someone is probably up to no good.  However, if I understand the document, it is (or will) probably be public one day anyway.  I would let Richard know just as an FYI and see what are his comments.

Who is Rad?  This is Lodi's application to itself for approval to use the plant site for a generating plant?  If the AG office wants to see it, I have trouble imagining a harmless reason:  I almost wonder if the AG is interested in whether the city would have legal authority to both apply and approve.  But somebody would have had to arouse the state's interest; who would do that?  PG&E?

If the application is a public document, then the state could easily get it anyway, so it's OK to send it, but why wouldn't the state have asked the city for it?

Kenton 
  

Gentlemen- 
FYI - Tim Murphy at URS called me today to let me know that Rad Bartlam called him and asked him to send a copy of the Lodi Land Use Application to the State Attorney General's Office.  Rad said he didn't know why they wanted it, and Tim has no clue either.  I told Tim it was OK to send it.  Any guesses as to why they want it?

Dean

nron entity, and was claiming that Enron had breached that agreement.  This=
 client is allegedly preparing to file a petition against us.  Steve told h=
is client that DWT could not represent Texas-Ohio in litigation against Enr=
on, and Steve asked me to try to find out what agreement his client might b=
e talking about (at that time, Steve did not have a copy of the agreement).=
  Steve asked his client to produce the agreement, and at the same we check=
ed throughout Enron for the agreement (Vicki, you checked around and couldn=
't find any agreement between EES and Texas-Ohio).  We weren't even sure wh=
ich Enron entity was involved.  We did kick around my proposal that Steve m=
ight be able to serve as a mediator between Texas-Ohio and Enron, to attemp=
t to settle the dispute without litigation.

Now we have the agreement, and it is with EES.  I will send it to you when =
I get a good-quality copy (which is being sent to me today).  From my almos=
t-illegible faxed copy, It is a Client Commission Agreement between EES and=
 Texas-Ohio, Inc., dated October 13, 2000.  Timonthy J. Hamilton signed as =
Attorney-in-Fact for EES; there are no lawyers' initials on the execution b=
lock.  Texas-Ohio is entitled to recommend to EES prospective commercial an=
d industrial customers served by SoCal, SDG&E, SWG (Southwest Gas), and PG&=
E.  If EES enters into an agreement with any such identified customers, Tex=
as-Ohio earns a commission.  There are provisions concerning price quoting =
and commission calculation; I'm sure you are familiar with those.

I am not familiar with this agreement or the extent of its use, and I do no=
t yet know the nature of Texas-Ohio's claim, although I would suspect it is=
 for non-payment of commissions allegedly due.  I will forward the agreemen=
t to you, and I'll stand by to help on this, should you want me to.   And S=
teve Greenwald would be happy to try to broker a peace, if that offer becom=
es attractive (I'd be happy to introduce you to him, or to work with him, a=
s you wish).

Sheila, this is FYI so that you'll know what's happened on this matter.  It=
's been a while since we discussed it.  Richard, this is FYI also, inasmuch=
 as this could lead to litigation.

Thank you,=20

Talk to Dave. I think he reports to Shelia so you should talk to her as well.

	This is another example of litigation involving NEPCO about which 'the litigation group' (me) knew nothing.  I assume David obtained Derrick's approval for counsel (he usually does) but I still wonder what other matters are hiding under the rug that we don't know about.
	Last time we discussed this you mentioned that you wanted us involved in their litigation the same way we would be involved if they were here. Accordingly, should I talk to Dave and find out what else is out there?  This deal is very similar to the last situation wherein NEPCO had filed an arbitration and we didn't find out about it until well after the thing was under way. 
Gail,  

I think you are referring to a case between the Oklahoma Dept. of Health and
NEPCO, and yes I have it.  Steve Jantzen of McKinney and Stringer in
Oklahoma City was retained early on when the threat of litigation was
evident.  There was actually an earlier case filed but improperly served on
NEPCO so the court dismissed it.  This is a new case  and repeat of the old
case which has now been properly served on NEPCO.  The case will be stayed
pursuant to a Consent Decree that is being negotiated by NEPCO with the
Dept. of Health concerning compliance with the correct ratio of apprentices
to licensed electricians on the Jenks, OK jobsite.   In fact, this issue
will be moot soon as the project is near completion and all matters of
compliance will be non existent when the workforce is released later this
month.

On the other case for a $2800 collection matter, that is being handled by
Bonnie White and set to be dismissed by the plaintiff on agreement by NEPCO
to pay a compromised amount.  This case should never have happened expect
for the fact that a forwarding address from a closed office in California
never properly forwarded the claimant's invoices to NEPCO

My partner Donn Pickett has been trying to get Richard Sanders to sign off on the attached conflicts letter concerning our representation of Reliant in the litigation in California in which Enron is also involved.  I understand the letter confirms prior conversations between Richard and Donn.  Karen suggested that, because you see Richard frequently, maybe we could enlist your help in getting the paperwork processed.  We would greatly appreciate that.

I hope all is going well for you and your family.  Let me know if you have any questions.

I talked to Mark and I don't think we have any interest.

Please see the message below and let me know whether you would have an interest in visiting with Steve Newton with respect to his idea.  Jim

Jim - 
 
It has been several years since  we've visited, and there are a couple of areas I'd like to update with you  on.  I'm hopeful, after reading the following, that you will feel it  is worthwhile for us to get together again.
 
First, my last litigation project at  Fulbright & Jaworski just came to a close very unexpectedly, due  to a third party stay order, and I am once again looking for new matters to work  on.  I have attached my updated resume for your reference, or to pass on to  others in your Law Department who might have needs for my type of skills on a  project basis.  At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I've mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats.
 
Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a "Legal Information Counsel" position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.   
 
I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.  
 
I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.  
 
I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.

Is there any way that we can move this to 3? I have a meeting from 1:30-2:30. Or just move it back 30 min.

Tom Engel will conduct the demonstration for Bill LaFuze and Peter Mims on Wednesday at 2:15 p.m..  I will meet Bill and Peter at 2 p.m. and escort them to the new building.  Tom Engel will do sample trades and answer any questions they have.  Do you want to participate? 

Thanks.

Greg was going to see how he did and whether we could rehabilitate him. Check w/ Greg before we talk to Mark.

	Do you want to set something up with whoever you think appropriate to discuss Dan's coming to trial and his performance? We discussed this when we were in NY and I wanted to follow up in case you needed me to do anything. 

At the risk of taking grief for having a premeeting before the premeeting before the meeting, can we talk for 15 minutes sometime today(before 5)

think of me.  I think it bears a striking resemblance to me, don't you?

Andrew Edison, Gail Brownfeld, Richard Sanders

Mark / Richard,

Can we please get a list of the attorneys in your groups that work on EGM cases by the end of today?  We are attempting to respond to a request from the EGM Office of the Chair.  

Thanks.

Sayed
Edie, the attorneys in the Global Markets area are as follows:

Alan Aronowitz
Dan Rogers
Ned Crady
John Boomer
Robert Bruce
Dominic Carolan
Wayne Gresham
Matthias Lee (Singapore)
Jane McBride (Japan)
David Minns (Australia)
Limor Nissan (NY)
Coralina Rivera
Mike Robison
John Viverito

I have not heard back from Mark Taylor or Richard Sanders as of yet.  Sorry.  Maybe just guess for them.  Deb

Deb, 
EGM is requesting a list of the attorneys that work on EGM cases.  Based on our allocation schedule (I have attached it again for your reference), the following cost center owners are allocating costs to EGM: Sanders, Taylor, Aronowitz, Cash.

Could you please give me a list of attorneys within these groups that work on EGM?  I realize that Aronowitz's group is 100% EGM, so a list of attorney's in that group would work.  I also realize that Michelle Cash is probably the one within her own group who would do any work for them.  In addition though, for Sanders and Taylor, can you find out from them who in their group would work on EGM?  Is it them or attorneys within their groups?

I need to have this information today if possible.

Thanks,
Edie

Re: reporting loop----Andy

`
	Richard,

	This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced referral.  You told me that we were to act as first-chair trial counsel in this matter, and instructed me to retain local counsel immediately.

	On the recommendation of Susman & Godfrey and Willy Wood of Fulbright & Jaworski, and with Jim Derrick's authority, I am happy to report that I have retained Lazaro Garza-Gongora of Laredo as local counsel for us in this matter, at his usual hourly rate of $175, and a retainer of $5,000, to be applied by him against his fees and expenses.   By acting quickly on this, we eliminated the risk of the remaining defendants snapping up all available local counsel and being forced to beg for a share of one.  I would of course be willing to consider sharing Lazaro (and his fees) with other defendants, but with the understanding that in the event of a conflict, Lazaro would only represent us, and would be allowed to stay in the case. 

	I anticipate that there will be a comprehensive joint defense agreement in this matter and that both local counsel and experts, including gas measurement experts, may be shared.  I will be speaking with you shortly about retaining a gas measurement expert.

	Lazaro is going to the courthouse to review the court's file and will report shortly on what he finds.

	Please let me know how you want Lazaro's bills handled.

	Please let me know who needs to be in the reporting loop on this one.

	As always, we greatly appreciate the chance to work with you.

	I will keep you closely advised.

	Britt

	.

Peter Mims called this a.m.. He reviewed the documents we sent yesterday and seemed pleased.  We wants more detail on the specific section pertaining to "clearing" of orders. 

I spoke with Leonardo Pacheco who suggested we meet with Kevin Montagne (he reports directly to Jay Webb and is the Sr. Director in charge of IT E-Commerce.)

I've left a voice mail to get on his calendar on Monday for a meeting with Peter and Bill.  Do you want to attend if I get time with him?

Thanks.

I just sent you this case. Please coordinate w/ David

This is the Grynberg lookalike we talked about.

=09A couple of suggestions on which I would appreciate your response:

=091.  I believe we need to have internal due diligence/factual investigati=
on done on whether any of the Enron entities served--Enron Corp.(of which N=
orthern was a division for a period of time), Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. (EG=
M) or Intratex ever gathered gas, was the first measurer of gas, or provide=
d measurement of gas on which ad valorem taxes were calculated, for Zapata =
County or communitized wells in adjacent counties that included leases loca=
ted in whole or in part in Zapata County.  The petition specifically mentio=
ns that it includes acts going back to 1974 and earlier, so I would like to=
 see how far back we can fairly easily put together a chronology.  What I h=
ope to have is a time line of who did what and during what period of time, =
and locate the most important documents to show this. =20

=09I am assuming that EGM was at all times only a marketer, although we nee=
d to do the due diligence to make sure.  Enron Corp. will be pretty easy, a=
lthough Northern was for a brief period of time in the early 90s a division=
 of Enron Corp., and Northern had non-contiguous gathering in South Texas t=
hat stopped right at the Zapata County line.  If that gathering system took=
 gas from, say, a well in an adjacent county that was communitized with a l=
ease in Zapata County, Enron Corp. may stay in the picture.  Last, with res=
pect to Intratex, I am told by Lou that we no longer have the Intratex docu=
ments; did they go with HPL as a result of the sale?=20

=09Becky and I are stretched thin on various matters right now and would li=
ke to suggest that we retain Marianne Salinas on this project immediately. =
=20

=092. I think it would be helpful to snag a first-rate gas measurement cons=
ultant now, before they all get taken.  I know Ken Cessac, who works here, =
very well, and think a great deal of him.  I know Andy has used him extensi=
vely already in Grynberg-related matters.  You may want to save money and n=
ot retain our own consultant, and instead rely on Ken; however, I know that=
 Ken is being kept very busy.  On the other hand, I also think it is likely=
 that we will wind up sharing at least the testifying gas measurement exper=
ts and their costs.  So, this is a judgment call.  However, I would be incl=
ined to go ahead and retain Paul LaNasa, who sits on several AGA committees=
, as an Enron-only consulting expert, even though I don't think he is up to=
 speed on the Grynberg allegations.  Both Grant Harvy and I were very impre=
ssed by him during the Northern v. ONEOK arbitration, during which we worke=
d with him extensively and presented him as an expert witness (although I d=
on't proposed to use him as a testifying expert here).  My point would be t=
hat if there was anything wrong with Enron's measurement that was either wo=
rse than or better than our co-defendants' measurement,  or put us in a dif=
ferent position, I am very confident he could point it out to us. =20

=09I appreciate your thoughts.

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation
=09Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items=
 of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron =
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
 reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such =
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse i=
mpact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

=09In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County Di=
strict Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Ho=
uston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron =
Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plai=
ntiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase co=
ntracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the c=
ase was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise res=
olved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the En=
ron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connectio=
n with the "Panhandle program," a special marketing program established in =
the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a ver=
dict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege=
 that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certa=
in gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably wi=
th other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial =
court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March=
 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certif=
ication was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron D=
efendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative=
 defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants beli=
eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorou=
sly contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believe=
s that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material ad=
verse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

=09On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Buildi=
ng in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily =
injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas=
 Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air d=
istribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the buil=
ding. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers wer=
e named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puer=
to Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath =
Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers=
, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Pue=
rto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages f=
or wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property dama=
ge allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without dete=
rmining the cause of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate furt=
her that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to det=
ermine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and,=
 if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agre=
ed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been set=
tled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the U=
nited States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have =
yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances=
 can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters=
 will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or resul=
ts of operations.

=09Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (P=
GE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating faci=
lity.  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a g=
eneral rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remainin=
g investment in Trojan.=20

=09The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to liti=
gation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Ap=
peals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to=
 the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citize=
ns Utility Board (CUB).

=09In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff o=
f the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its invest=
ment in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw=
 from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve =
the Trojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking ele=
ments of the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approv=
als, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to c=
ustomers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Colle=
ction of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the set=
tlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's wi=
thdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the lit=
igation.  The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the =
settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a retur=
n on its investment in Trojan.=20

=09Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assuranc=
es can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matte=
rs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or res=
ults of operations.

Other Contingencies
=09Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=
 local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requ=
ire expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=
 operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating =
sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to r=
esult in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses =
are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or=
 results of operations.

=09Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater reme=
diation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur ma=
terial expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

=09Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for wh=
olesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a =
combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in a=
vailable hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-relianc=
e on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California=
's regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases=
 but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity betw=
een costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public=
 utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California E=
dison Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power cost=
s and certain obligations related to the difference between third party pow=
er purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and S=
CE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstandi=
ng obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California =
Power Exchange (the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System=
 Operator (the Independent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities=
.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary pet=
ition for bankruptcy.

=09Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situati=
on in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result=
 in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initi=
atives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not poss=
ible to predict their outcome at this time.

=09Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utiliti=
es, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energ=
y in California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of=
 these entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities=
 and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables=
 and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its expos=
ure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainti=
es involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot =
be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adv=
erse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

=09India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol P=
ower Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constru=
cting an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasif=
ication facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its =
investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-=
recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State E=
lectricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Govern=
ment of Maharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the gu=
arantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of th=
e power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The con=
tract disputes relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay cer=
tain capacity and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM=
 and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documen=
ts and (b) MSEB's statements that MSEB has "rescinded" the PPA and MSEB is =
therefore no longer bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Ph=
ase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II =
and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts=
 for non-payment.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolv=
e such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce =
any judgment or settlement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actio=
ns are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pu=
rsue all available legal remedies under the project documents.  As a result=
 of these disputes, the 740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by=
 MSEB.  Further, Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II.  E=
nron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have=
 a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of ope=
rations.

I need you to handle this. Call me.
I believe that Scott Josey is the commercial guy responsible for Crescendo.  I have left him a voice mail about this and will let everyone know his response.

Janet just left me a voice mail and believes this is an ENA deal after all.  Barbara--you may want to get ahold of Janet to verify ownership on this one.  Please let this group know what the final answer is.  DF

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.

Thanks. We will run with it.

I understand from Janet Place that this is not a Northern Border project but rather a North America project and that she is leaving you a voice mail regarding this.  I assume that either you or Andy Edison will follow up.  Thank you. JIm

Thx. We need to talk asap today.

I have talked with Ken Krissa and have placed a couple of calls to Jesus.  In short, there is no conference call set for today; however, Jesus has brought back with him (from Cresendo's offices) copies of all the correspondence between Cresendo and Rocky Mountain Helium.  These documents also contain an opinion letter from Cresendo's outside counsel, Bill Ward, at Pruitt, Gushee and Bachtell.  I've also learned that ENA owns about 85-90% of Cresendo with the remainder being owned by NG Resources (a BCCK Engineering entity) and Cresendo Energy Partners.  Cresendo Energy Partners is owned by Ken Krissa and another guy and is the managing member of the LLC.  I'm getting a copy of the LLC agreeemnt .
I'll keep you posted.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

DJ Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal<ENE.N><MSFT.O>
   By Michael Rieke
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

    HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling
was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for
his company's foundering broadband business.

    Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth
for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron
would give more details on the deal later.

    After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence
by suing Microsoft.

    In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron
claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal.

    The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide
network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed
Internet service, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for
use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the
deal, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal,
so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal,
the lawsuit said.
 

This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
 
The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.

The meeting is in 3321.

I spoke with Gordon.  The assets that he knew about were ones that we have already looked at.  I was very nice and told him that I was appreciative of his notifying us about them.  

I owe him a call to tell him whether we are still pursuing these projects or whether we have given up on them.  Gordon wanted to be sure that we had no interest before bringing these projects to his other clients' attention.

I need Linda Guinn To have VP authority to approve invoices as outlined below.
Per our conversation, SAP needs an approval delegation from you so that I can approve your invoices at the VP level.

Please forward this email to SAP security for processing.

Two answers:1) I don't think you need one--you can file anywhere in the Southern District, 2) a desire to get crazy judge, like Sam Kent.

	Apparently, he is going to do a broad search and has asked VE's expert searcher to get involved as well.  What would be the basis for a filing in Galveston? 

What about Midland or (worse) Galveston ?

I have had several more conversations that convince me that FERC will provide very helpful answers to the three quesitions that Robin sent to me regarding FERC's jurisdiction over the issues in the California cases.

You should be aware of timing issues.  Two of FERC's five positions (both Republican or Independent) are vacant, but soon to be filled by nominated candidates.  Both nominees (Pat Wood and Nora Brownell) are expected to be helpful to our interests.   If we suceed in getting a U.S. district court judge to sollicit FERC's view befor the  two new nominees are seated, there may be a slight risk that members of Congress will hold their nominations hostage over the issue of how FERC answers the court.

I have copied Linda Robertson, the head of Enron's Washington shop, so that she can assess how real this risk is and whether it should influence our timing.

FYI
Last night's game was rescheduled for 4 June.  They're going to skip
Wakefield's turn, so Pedro's pitching on 24 May.  That means that if
things stay the same, he'd pitch on Thursday, 21 June and miss that
weekend against the Blue Jays entirely.

But heck, 2-0 games are boring, right?

Do you have a list of the PX participants committee that you could send me by e-mail.

John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?
here's the latest--if we agree to get involved in this, they will dismiss enron defts if it is ok with you

I think it would be worth pursuing that option with your client.  If it
meant the involvement of your firm (to any significant extent), the
plaintiffs would likely agree to dismiss the Enron defendants.

What case is this and why is it still in front of Whaley?

There was telephonic oral argument today before Judge Whaley on the filed
rate issues in Campbell v. SDGE.  It went very well.  Judge Whaley began by
asking Campbell to argue first, since "It seems to me you're flying in the
face of the filed rate doctrine."  The bulk of the argument focused on two
issues:  (1) what if anything is the effect of FERC's inability to issue
retroactive rate relief, and (2) (to a much lesser extent) how a class
action based on SDGE customers only avoided the discrimination prong of the
doctrine.  Campbell's argument was ineffective, consisting mostly of his
preferred social policy rather than any law.  His most substantive argument
was that filed rate was based on a res judicata-like theory, and since
market-based rates are not passed on by FERC before they go into effect, an=
d
can't changed be retroactively, resort to the courts was appropriate.

I was not asked any specific questions at first, but was rather just asked
to respond.  I began by advising the court of the July 25th order in which
FERC held that filed rate applied to these market-based rates, then
discussed Norwood, then addressed the res judicata analogy by pointing to
the cases that hold that mere filing, rather than agency review, invokes th=
e
doctrine.  Whaley asked me a couple of questions about retroactive relief,
the most significant of which was along the following lines:  "So what you
are saying is that if, at the end of the day, it is determined that there i=
s
no right of retroactive relief, then that's just like a statute of
limitations or any other limitation on a right or remedy that doesn't effec=
t
FERC's jurisdiction."  I answered affirmatively, stating that the salient
point was that it was within Congress' power to decide how this type of
interstate commerce was to be regulated, and that if Congress imposed
limitations on remedies for illegal behavior, we were all bound by that.  H=
e
seemed content with that answer.

Campbell replied in an argument that was pretty close to saying, "There mus=
t
always be a remedy somewhere."  Interestingly, Whaley then asked Campbell a
couple of times whether he would concede Keogh's applicability if there was
a FERC remedy.  I think this was a setup, and Campbell walked into it,
basically saying yes.  Whaley didn't close the trap, but it would not
surprise me if he finds that the existence of a remedy at the agency doesn'=
t
matter, and since Campbell admits that Keogh would bar the claim if there
were a remedy, he's out of court.

Whaley took it under submission and said he would issue an order.  I think
he'll rule very narrowly, stressing that Campbell's is a claim under the
FPA.  I tried to broaden his thinking, arguing that we ought not allow ever=
y
plaintiff to attempt to reinvent the regulatory system by dreaming up every
manner of legal attack on filed rates, but I suspect he saw through that an=
d
will rule narrowly.  Anyway, I expect a good result.

Richard-

I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
you.

Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's
Lagrave Field.

Other than the Taub case, I don't know of anything. Linda?

Please take a look at this e-mail and let me know if you are aware of anything.

Thanks.

Andy,
I need to make disclosure on any threatened or pending litigation against BAM Lease Company or any other party affecting the Leased Facilities. The Leased Facilities are the Houston, Bammel and Texas City Loops and the Bammel Storage Facility including the compressor sites and compressors as well as meters. Currently the Leased Facilities are leased by HPL Assets Holdings LP to BAM as assignee of HPL. BAM will be leasing the Leased Facilities back to HPL under the sublease. Can you let me know if there is any threatened or pending litigation involving these entities or assets specifically--as always,
 I appreciate your help--

What about lunch today(fri)

Are things settling down for you?  Do you  want to do lunch after the Investiture on the 31st?  Ileana. P.S. My frontal lobes are killing me.....Do you happen to know any .......?

Howard Weg left me a message last night that you were scheduled at 10am. I suggested to Harry that he call Howard directly, as he is the keeper of the schedule. The interviews are at Greenberg Glusker, which I think is in Century City. The Angels are in town Tues night. How far away is that?

Do you know what time our presentation is going to be on Wednesday.  We are trying to coordinate a bunch of differnent schedules.

Is that going to do it?
It's completed.  Linda R Guinn's (P00503232) been setup to approve at the Senior Director Level (up to $74,999.99) in iBuyit eProcurement.

Let me know if you'd like me to handle the Pain Creek matter.  Thanks.

Of course Gail.  I'm sorry you didn't get a copy sooner. 

Millie,  Please make a copy of the arbitration demand and our response that
Seth Price submitted on our behalf.  This is entitled "Foster Wheeler
Limited vs. NEPCO"  Please fax or overnight mail the copy to Gail Brownfeld
at Enron, EWS.  Go to the Enron web site (People Finder) to locate her
mailing address.  Thanks.

By copy to Richard Sanders, I left a voice message last week with you
describing a new matter we are developing as a claim against Overland
Construction, Inc. (a subsidiary of Black and Veatch) on a project called
"Payne Creek", located in central Florida.  Considering the losses suffered
to date ($7 Million) the project is now spelled "Pain Creek".  I spoke to
Schwartzenburg about it and he suggested we enlist your group for
assistance.  I have also retained Seth Price's firm (with Derrick's
approval) to help evaluate and develop the claim.  I would like to schedule
a conference call with Seth, myself and a member of your group to review the
claim.  Schwartzenburg and myself are available on Thursday, September 13th
and so is Seth but only in the morning.  Given the time zone differences
between Seth and myself, I would like to target 11:00 AM central time.  Let
me know if Gail or someone else will be the assigned attorney.  The claim
involves construction cost overruns due to errors in the owners
specification. 

Thanks.

                David,
                        Sorry for the phone tag of last week. The reason I
was calling
                actually related to the attached.Can I get a copy of the
file on this
                and also can we schedule a call with outside counsel to
discuss this
                matter?  Apparently, life at EWS in not that different from
EI and as
                the trusty litigation manager, I need to be involved in
this.  To the
                extent that I have suggested a call on Wednesday to discuss
the Pakistan
                case, maybe you and I can arrange something with Seth to
occur before or
                after that call.  It would be helpful to have what was filed
beforehand,
                if it could be arranged. Thanks in advance.

                Yes, against NEPCO.  We have retained Seth Price of Shapiro
Fussell in
                Atlanta.  I have Derrick's approval.  The action was
delivered two weeks
                ago
                and then put on hold.  After the unsuccessful settlement
meeting, it was
                ignited again.  Seth will issue our response on Tuesday
(9/4).  Seth has
                worked on NEPCO matters before and is familiar with our
business
                practices
                and contract terms with suppliers. 

                This is rather new matter and I didn't have the opportunity
to involve
                you
                earlier.

                                This is a heads up to a mounting dispute
with a major
                equipment
                                supplier,
                                Foster Wheeler Limited (HRSG supplier).
Currently they
                have
                initiated
                                an
                                arbitration action before the AAA here in

                                M) on the Linden, NJ project of which we

                                Galen,

                                I don't have the full history of dealing on
this
                purchase
                order with
                                FWL,
                                but my instincts say we don't have to accept
"material"
                changes to the
                                terms
                                on the eve of signing a PO.  FWL's attempt
to adjust
                significant delay
                                risk
                                at the eleventh hour constitutes a breach of
good faith
                and
                fair
                                dealing.
                                It is as if we were to sign the PO based on
weeks of
                review
                of a firm
                                and
                                final price but mark down the price a few
million on the
                final draft
                                because
                                we felt we were taken to the cleaners on a
previous job
                they
                sold to us.
                                FWL needs to be instructed to accept the PO
without the
                proposed
                                changes.
                                If they refuse, we have (and we must tell
them) the
                choice
                to contract
                                with
                                another party and hold them liable for the
extra cost of
                another
                                supplier to
                                make the schedule required.  This liability
is based on
                breach of an
                                implied
                                contract and FWL faces damages for
detrimental reliance
                (that would be
                                the
                                incremental cost above FWL's firm price
charged by the
                replacement
                                vendor).
                                The reliance argument is that we excused
other bidders
                weeks
                ago and
                                chose
                                to exclusively deal with FWL based on
agreement
                (reliance)
                of terms and
                                conditions presented in earlier drafts of
the PO or
                referred
                to in
                                previous
                                PO documents.  The detriment argument is FWL
knew they
                had
                us captive to
                                them on this deal.  By going forward without
other
                bidders,
                we lost
                                price
                                protection and commitment for schedule by
other bidders,
                therefore we
                                are at
                                a detriment without market forces.  In the
best world,
                our
                purchasing
                                activities need to keep proposals
competitive by not
                dropping back to
                                one
                                supplier for critical path equipment.

                                I mentioned a choice here, the other choice
is to
                continue
                to deal with
                                FWL
                                and accept their additional terms because
the risk of
                changing horses
                                and
                                being successful on a lawsuit based on
implied contract
                and
                detrimental
                                reliance outweighs the risk and cost of
having to
                "mitigate"
                the effect
                                of
                                LDs on FWL if critical path work is not
impacted or hard
                to
                document and
                                prove it was impacted, and whether our
obligations were
                fulfilled in
                                this
                                respect.  Since FWL has now opened the door
to change
                "material" terms
                                on
                                the eve of signing, we have the opportunity
to do the
                same
                with them,
                                but
                                that doesn't help if the parties continue to
go in
                opposite
                directions
                                while
                                your end date stays the same.  I would say
they know
                this is
                a dilemma
                                to us
                                and are betting we will deal with them on
these new
                first-time
                                "material"
                                changes to the PO terms.  If we go with the
second
                choice, I
                would
                                encourage
                                NEPCO and Enron to take FWL off any
preferred bidders
                list.

                                In addition, I thought I heard from the
folks who
                attended
                the Linden 6
                                settlement meeting a week ago that the
parties said they
                would not let
                                the
                                litigation on Linden 6 effect our other
on-going deals.
                Apparently FWL
                                is
                                taking their issues on Linden 6 over to
other deals.  We
                may
                want to do
                                the
                                same.

                                Stepping back a bit, unless our documents
and witnesses
                are
                crystal
                                clear on
                                the implied contract theory and we have a
clear fact
                pattern
                for
                                detrimental
                                reliance, I wouldn't lick our chops and be
confident
                that we
                got them on
                                this liability.  I am willing to advance an
argument for
                posture
                                purposes in
                                order to force some conclusion on the PO
terms that they
                have attempted
                                to
                                open up.  And with what little I know thus
far, I would
                encourage we try
                                to
                                strike a deal in lieu of another lawsuit.

                                                I am forwarding an email
from Mr. Garry
                Greatrix,
                                Project
                                Manager, Foster Wheeler Ltd.  Please read
the document
                attached entitled
                                8&13.doc.  This has been presented as
revised language
                to
                "all NEPCO
                                contracts" from Foster Wheeler.  This
suggested language
                has
                been
                                presented
                                as endorsed by Foster Wheeler legal and
executive
                management.  The FW
                                team
                                explained that this language resulted from
what they
                have
                experienced
                                with
                                NEPCO on recent projects, specifically
Linden 6 and
                Kendall
                and that
                                they
                                cannot sign the purchase contract without
it.

                                                Since this affects more than

                                any acceptance or dialog regarding FW's
suggested
                language
                would need to

I did not get a copy of the case.

In case you have not seen this case, it talks about class certification of
unfair competition claims in California -- even allows a national class
based upon California Law.

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a meeting on Tues re this issue. I will include Mike Day. Is there anyone else that should be in this meeting---EES legal?
PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Can either of you help me get Jim an answer?

CEO | Super 180's
Made in Huddersfield England

With demand so high, and supply increasingly limited, it's a privilege to be
able to offer CEO Super 180's to our clients.  But, what exactly does make
these fabrics the finest Super 180's in the world?

New South Whales, Australia.  There, on a ranch deep in the outback, 114,000
specially bred Merino sheep are raised under strictly controlled conditions.
All are individually numbered, fed a special diet and even protected from
the elements by jackets.  Each year, a new generation of prized rams and
ewes surpasses the previous one in the quality of their wool.  Yet, at a
demanding 14.5-14.9 microns, less than 1% of total production will be judged
worthy of CEO Super 180's.

Huddersfield, England.  At Taylor & Stewart, a famed mill known for its
expertise, the longest and strongest and most supple of these wool staple
yarns are spun, woven and finished according to 400 year old tradition.
Fabrics are scoured with rainwater which travels from 60 miles away through
ancient rock to reach the mill's own 1500 foot deep well.  Unique finishing
processes truly set these fabrics apart, and are accomplished via treasured,
time-tested machinery and state of the art computerized equipment.

The result is a magnificent, superbly tailorable cloth that's actually finer
than cashmere.  Its soft, buttery hand, durability and resilience are
unparalleled in the luxury market.  Of raw materials as scarce and
painstakingly acquired as earth's rarest gems, the cost of such wools has
risen significantly.  Yet, a close partnership between Tom James and the
renowned mills of Huddersfield permits us to control costs and make CEO
Super 180's readily available to you.

Surely, a privilege you will enjoy for seasons to come.

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a meeting on Tues re this issue. I will include Mike Day. Is there anyone else that should be in this meeting---EES legal?
PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Can either of you help me get Jim an answer?

Bob --

Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on accounting procedures.  Where is this going?  This would be very bad.

I have left a message for Jim. I will be getting back from working a week in the Portland office on Sunday, so we would have to leave on Monday. Are any other weeks after that good?

 
Hi Richard,
How about the week of July 16-17?  That works for Novak and me.  I'll make an agenda.  Please check with Jim.
 
 
  Rgds,
      Michelle

I am flyingt to LA tonight(Mon) and can be reached at 713-410-6128. The las=
t I heard, Susman was coming. Whether Steve Susman comes remains to be seen=
.

Here is an email I received from the Susman Godfrey firm about their
interest in representing the Participants Committee in the commandeering
matter.

Howard,

My partner Steve Susman forwarded me a copy of your email to him.  Our firm
looks forward to meeting with your committee on Wednesday.  While I had
planned to attend when the interview was scheduled for last Thursday, I
cannot come this week because I am starting trial in Chicago.  I am not sur=
e
yet who from our firm will be attending, but can assure you that we are ver=
y
interested in the case.  Whether by ourselves or jointly with Marshall
Grossman and his firm, we think this sort of lawsuit is right up our alley.
We know how to get a complex commercial dispute ready for trial, maximize
its settlement value, or try it successfully if necessary.

I'll try to give you a call Monday or Tuesday to let you know who else from
our firm will be joining Marc Seltzer, who heads our LA office, at the
interview.  You can reach me at 713-653-7827 if you wish.

By the way, there is considerable information about our firm and its lawyer=
s
at our web site, www.susmangodfrey.com

Thanks, Howard.  I look forward to speaking with you.

The following documents, received today, have been forwarded for your immediate attention:

LAP, LLC d/b/a Comfort Suites v. NEPCO, a Delaware corporation, and Michael Renfro, an individual; No. CS-2001-02881, In the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Tulsa County, Oklahoma.  SUMMONS and PETITION to CT Corp for NEPCO (National Energy Production Corporation) by certified mail on 5/14/01.  CT Corp first forwarded the paperwork to Redmond, WA and it was returned to them.  CT Corp then forwarded the paperwork to Becky Stephens, Enron, Houston on 5/29/01.  
**PLEASE NOTE THE SHORT ANSWER DATE: 20 DAYS FROM 5/14/01.**

Is that # right? What gives?

I have settled the Ecogas/Enron/Randy Maffett lawsuit.  No need to thank me,just send me gifts.  Seriously, I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we agreed that Ecogas would pay him $53,000.  Hall has agreed to release Enron, Ecogas, Maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.  He will also release any and all patent issues. The goal is for him to move on with his life and for us to move on as well.  I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.

I am on board. If the PX comes back again, I will call their in-house attys.

Can you pass this along to Elizabeth to ensure Sanders is on board as well?  We are renewing our L/C's on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders.  However, the request below is to "replenish" the CASH that was drawn down...please advise.

I agree with Steve's position stated in his separate e'mail.  Don't give these guys a penny.----cgy

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping required levels available?

MO

Participant:

Pursuant  to  your  written  request  and  in  accordance  with  the Preliminary
Injunction  issued on March 5, 2001 by the Court in Enron Power Marketing, Inc.,
et  al.  v.  California  Power Exchange Corporation, USDC Case No. 01-00901, the
California Power Exchange Corporation (CalPX) applied cash collateral maintained
by Enron Power Marketing, Inc. in payment of the following invoices:

          Dec RT F   $ 15,297.24
                Jan RT P    $ 64,547.04
                Jan RT F    $   2,255.74

Enron Power Marketing, Inc. has not restored such collateral.  Please be advised
that  the  Preliminary Injunction requires CalPX market participants to maintain
their current levels of collateral while the FERC Proceeding and the Preliminary
Injunction  are  in  effect,  and  allows CalPX to take any necessary actions to
preserve such collateral.

I am trying to set up a conf. call today at 10:30 central to speak to the Chicago attys. Andy is not involved in this case. 
 
Mark, fyi
Paul J is away sick but asked me to deal with this.  I have also discussed with Paul S.  Conference call planned for 2pm today with Andy Edison to discuss this (and Kemper).
 
Let's keep the pressure up by all means but I understand that an extension of this period is not hard to come by. 
 
I assume you're talking about that with Andy, Paul J.

Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.

Is this guy a problem for us in the litigation? I can talk to the Duke attys re preserving Enron's proprietary info. 
FYI,

Please note that Sean Crandall (trader in Portland) is resigning to go to work for Duke in Salt Lake City.

He worked on Northwest cash desk.

I haven't heard anything. Could it be that Bill was overstating his position?

I have heard nothing more  about a grand jury..have you learned anything more?

I will be there.

Kathy, can you send me the info about the meeting?  Thanks.

Kathy, Bob Williams should attend this meeting tomorrow in my absence.

I think the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the UC/CSU contract in the SDG&E service area.  Richard, I think you are included because  EES will be briefing John Lavarato later this week.  Bob, can you bring Richard up to speed on the issues?

I am scheduled to go to the Lakers game. Sorry.

Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?

I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be
part of the group as well.  But it occurs to me that maybe no one talked to

Natwest, McDonald, and PaineWebber have collectively offered the
Farallon/Oaktree plaintiffs (and maybe Legg Mason, I am not sure) $13 million
to settle.  It is clear that this group hopes to persuade SDI and Enron to
contribute something to such a settlement, but they told Hennegan that they
would fund the full $13 million themselves if necessary.  Hennegan is asking
for something in the "high $20s"  I am advised that the settlement group is
prepared to go to the high teens, but it is not clear how much further.

I do not know the allocation of the $13 million among Natwest and McDonald,
except that I believe that Natwest is NOT paying the lion's share, as one
might expect.

If the bargaining proceeds, I am sure that someone will ask Enron to
contribute.

These are all the ones I am aware of.

Richard,

Please review the attached fax from Ben Ogletree, one of Natwest's lawyers,
especially the four attached agreements (which Natwest already has.)  Can I
represent to Natwest that these four agreements, along with the Oaktree
settlement agreement, constitute all settlement or cooperation agreements that
we have with any parties to any of NSM litigation?  If I can say that, the
issue of ECT Securities' deposition goes away.

Steve

Fergus and Gibbs.

EES has received a subpoena from the AG.  What outside counsel is advising us about these?  Fergus?  Molland?

I talked to Robin about this yesterday in relation to the class actions. I think the way we left it was that Jeff Alexander was going to look at the issue of transfering venue based on prejudice and get back to me. When do you need to make this motion?

Richard,

Do we need to consider filing a motion to transfer venue of this case on the ground of bias in the jury pool?  Do we prejudice your cases if we don't?

I am a little behind the curve--nothing new. Has this been resolved? Other than knowing what is happening, what do I need to do?

Will do. Hope you feel better.

Out of the office with 'flu. Back soon I hope. In my absence please contact Paul Simons on x36566, or John Champion on x36325.

Have we received a settlement offer? I saw Kevin Presto yesterday and he asked me about it. Lets talk today.
	Andy:

	To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpine
matter.

	I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone on
Friday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the office
until May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.
I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was
"working on" getting me a reply.

	We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make a
settlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion to
compel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its power
purchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for a
protective order which would limit their production to the contracts in
ERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 11. Second, we won our motion
to continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summary
judgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but the
court ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of its
ruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Our
supplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 22.  Third,
Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order from
the court requiring us to produce additional information on our damage
claim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which we
detailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to update
some of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman's
deposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this.

	Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon's
deposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduled
for June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In addition
to the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleading
amendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. We
have already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We have
drafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the case
was removed from state court and we were still on the state court original
petition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleading
ambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsic
evidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative.

	I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to our
settlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if you
have questions or comments on any of these matters.

	Best regards,

	Bill

I have sent you a check. I will take more tickets if someone drops out.

I have received an invoice from the Rockets for next season's tickets. The
total amount is $19,712.00, or $112 per seat. According to the Rockets,
there will be no increase for this season or the 2002/2003 season (but wait
until the new arena is built in 2003!). The breakdown is as follows:
Bill Gage (25%): $4928 (less $736 previously paid);
Bob Roten (25%): $4928;
Glenn Ballard (12.5%): $2464;
Pat Doherty (12.5%): $2464;
Richard Sanders (12.5%): $2464; and
Bill Eggleston (12.5%): $2464.
If you want to renew, I need your check by June 15. If you do not want to
renew, call me as soon as possible at 713/659-5100.

Sorry for the late reply. You are correct about  the policy. 

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

Has this been set? Who is coming? What is the agenda?

What looks better for you: June 11-12 or 12-13?

I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson (an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

Thanks

I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week?

it's tough because for a huge city with lots of lawyers there really aren't many business trial lawyers there.  its not like texas or california.

we know david boies well and have done a number of things with him.  he might be interested because there is so much at stake and it is so high profile.  of course, tho, he is stretched way way too thin and doesn't really have that much depth in his firm.  we could pitch it to him that we'll provide the back up, if you want.

another idea is david foster at willkie farr.  widely regarded in the city as one of the best trial lawyers. confidentially, we will be opening a nyc office by sept, and are negotiating with foster about his joining us.  i could put you in touch with some general counsel who think very highly of him.  again, we could provide coordination and back up if you like.  of course there would be value in maintaining consistency of positions in new york and california, less learning curve, etc.  i am a member of the new york bar as are about 8 of our partners.

Did you switch this?

	I have scheduled an all day meeting with Greg and Chris, in New York, on Friday, September 21, 2001. At this meeting wwe will discuss the trial plan and, in effect, have a dry run of what we might expect to occur during the October 11 trial.  Please let me know if you are available to attend. I have also asked that, by the end of this week, Brobeck provide us with a summary of the best arguments for and against both sides and an analysis of the realistic exposure to both sides. We can review this before the meeting on the 21st. 
	Also, the two motions for summary judgment we filed are set to be heard on October 1, 2001. The outcome of this hearing (assuming the judge makes a ruling) could certainly affect the tone and scope of the case. Please let me know if you are available on the 21st.  Thanks. 

Forget Boies and Weiss
Susman Godfrey, which practices everywhere, even in the Bronx?

If not those guys, how about:

1.  Boies & Schiller (but not Andy Hayes)

2.  Mel Weiss of Milberg Weiss

3.  Jamie Stecher-- a good friend of mine and great lawyer who left Paul
Weiss years ago and has a small litigation boutique

Sure.  Bob Joffe at Cravath.  Greg Joseph (used to be at Fried Frank, now on
his own).  Bernie Nussbaum at Wachtell Lipton.  Gary Naftalis at Kramer
Levin.

When are you in town, so we can have dinner?

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.

	Per your request for an update:

	1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

	2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

	3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

	I will keep you advised.

Delaware is fine.

Richard -

I have a company with whom we are negotiating a non-disclosure agreement.  We have been working off of their form, but have inserted our arbitration language.  We have put in New York as the operative law and they have responded with either Minnesota (their home jurisdiction) or Delaware (the state of their incorporation).  I have told them that Minnesota will not work and that we prefer NY, but they are holding the line on having Delaware.

Do we have a problem with Delaware for jurisdiction?  Also, this is a non-disclosure agreement and any subsequent  agreement would have to be negotiated as to forum.

Thanks for your response.

We made it but the house next door and the house catty-corner to us both flooded.

Steve:  Did Hennigan give you any timetable for getting back to you on settlement?  We will need to follow up quickly.

Richard:  Hope you escaped from the storm relatively unscathed.  It sounds like Tuesday was a drizzle compared to what Houston experienced yesterday.

See below.  Farallon has moved for summary judgment against Natwest, McDonald,
and PaineWebber.  If the motion is credible, it should ratchet up the pressure
on those three defendants to settle.  Assuming that we don't want to be the
only defendant at trial (or one of two, SDI being the other), we need to
follow the settlement negotiations as closely as we can and try to get in
(while appearing uninterested), or make a separate deal, at the last minute.

The key to getting current information on settlement efforts by the other
defendants is Mike Diamond.  Because Mike still wants Richard's business, and
Mike and I are close, Mike is likely to be pretty forthcoming if Richard or I
ask him what is going on.

We made it but the house next door and the house catty-corner did not. I called Zisman this morning and was told that his houe was flooded. Yes I need tickets-- 4 tickets for either Fri, Sat or Sun the 22nd, 23rd, or 24th.

A couple of things:

(1)  I hope you are dry

(2)  Rebecca McDonald's prep session is supposed to be at 10 a.m. today.  In the event no postponement of her depo was agreed to, Robert Rivera is planning to be at McDonald's office at 10 a.m.  I don't know if Mark Lowes will be there or not.  I told McDonald's assistant that it was up to her whether to have Mark there or not.  By the way, please let me know by e-mail what is up with the settlement talks.

(3)  Do you still need Red Sox tickets?  If so, let me know.  Cliff and I worked quite a bit with a firm up in Boston (Hill & Barlow) and I am sure I could have them find tickets for you.

Later.

Can you make sure that this goes to El Paso. I assume that we dont need to do anything else(?)
The following documents, received today, have been forwarded for your immediate attention:

Disregard my previous messageabout this case. Thanks for your assistance in=
 this matter.

This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cog=
en Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technol=
ogies Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complain=
t in the Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso E=
nergy Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effe=
ctive late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & Englis=
h to represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen ma=
tters before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  Thi=
s matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while =
working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  Da=
vid Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and=
 indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respe=
ct to this incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to=
 determine if any such obligations exist.

The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and=
 to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Co=
gen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state cou=
rt as Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection o=
f the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have aske=
d Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI=
 Linden or NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of=
 process is in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for =
it.  As this new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am=
 forwarding a copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process an=
d investigate the claim in your usual manner.=20

Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to b=
egin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.  Thanks. =20

Richrd - I'd like to stop by in the next few days for a quick update me on the CA litigation - I've been away on vacation and hear there have been a few recent developments.  Thanks

Yes-- but lets wait until you and I can talk live.

Let's talk.  Can we shift some more of the cost to ETS???

Great!  Now, what have you done for me lately?  The ETS entities are apparently still in this case and I'm feeling lonely already now that ENA is bugging out.  Where is our deal with Boies to get Quinn in and us out?  Thanks for the help on this Andy.  DF

I will keep you updated.

Andy

I don't know any of them, although I am familiar with Vinson & Elkins--they are an excellent firm.

We have been given a new list of potential arbitrators.  Please take a minute and let me know if any of these represent us, and the general level of representation.  Thank you again for your help.  If you want to leave me a voicemail, my telephone number is (713) 646-6412.

     1.  William Frank Carroll--Donohoe, Jameson & Carroll
     2.  James E. Coleman Jr.--Carrington, Coleman, Sloman & Blumenthal
     3.  Randall Duke--Johnson & McElroy
     4.  Edward Fiorito--Consultant
     5.  Eric F. Hale, Jr.--formerly with Carrington, Coleman; now self-employed
     6.  Herbert J. Hammond--Thompson & Knight

     9.  C. Michael Moore--Locke Liddell
    10.  Robert C. Prather, Sr.--Jordan, Dunlap, Prather & Harris, L.L.P.

No need to respond as to V&E or Locke Liddell, except as to information about the individuals.  Steve et al.,  Baker & McKenzie does represent Enron on several matters of which I am aware, but to my knowledge it is not one of our top 10 firms in billings.  

Please include on our database
After conferring with Rob Cole, I will make my recommendation to Mr. Derrick today as to local counsel so that we may get a responsive pleading on file in a timely fashion. Thereafter, Rob and I will coordinate the defense with local counsel and report in the usual fashion.

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this matter, please contact Dave. 

Thanks.

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the
preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.

Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will
allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY
FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.

In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when
hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2.   What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for
failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this
policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

None other than the GE case against Power Systems.

As Stuart's email below indicates, we are trying to confirm whether there is any litigation related to the project below.

Just a friendly reminder that you were going to double check with Richard Sanders regarding any "Actions" that relate to New Albany Power I, L.L.C. or the New Albany facility.

Stuart

Have fun. Please tell me it is some place exotic---like Long Beach?

i leave on vacation for 2 weeks this Sunday.  i stay in close touch with the office and can fed exp every day--if you call, i'll get back to you.  shon morgan will be doing a first draft of our reply brief in the ninth circuit.

Yes, our PR Dept has this service.Thanks.

Our local legal newspaper, The Daily Journal, reported in Thursday's edition
that the AG will ask a Sacramento Grand Jury to investigate whether "the
California market was manipulated and profits taken illegally, and whether there
was fraud against the public".  The story reports that the investigation "will
begin shortly after July 1" which is consistent with out recent intelligence.
My guess is you have already seen this basic story because the Journal picked it
off the AP wire service.

Do you already have some clipping service keeping track of all the stories being
published out here?  I've assumed you are doing this already, but if not and you
want to do that, let us know.

EES wants to terminate energy contracts(futures cintracts) with two bankrupt entities. Can you let Bob Williams know if you have any comments/suggestions to his letter?

Chris Boehler is the lawyer at A&K who handled the IDB Lease (the one that I gave you a copy of the other day).  Bill Neese is the lawyer for the IDB who worked across the table from Chris.  You might want to get Bill's number from Chris Boehler (Chris' direct lines is 713-220-4421) and give him a call.  I am sure that Bill is worried about who is covering his legal fees.  If memory serves me, the Lease calls for the IDB to be fully indemnified by the lessee (Gleason Power I, L.L.C.).  Please call if you need any further information.

The atty is Charna Sherman at Hahn Looser in Cleveland. By copy of this e-mail, I have asked Linda Guinn to take the lead in getting you this information.Linda-- I need to also find the Plaintiff interrogatory response in the CA NSM case to send to Bonnie. I sent the Int. to Dick Lydecker recently.

The following e-mail from Rob Cole relates to the NSM case that was filed in Ohio.  We need to provide him the name of our Ohio counsel, any engagement agreement with counsel, any invoices you have received to date on this matter, and copies of our answer and any other pleadings that have been filed.  We also need to ask outside counsel to provide a preliminary exposure evaluation.  Please let me know with whom I should work to gather this information.  Also, please send me a copy of the interrogatory response in the California case that you mentioned to me in the last week or so, so that we can revisit coverage on that matter.  Thanks.

Bonnie, Jim Studdert has assigned me the lawsuit of John W. Schultes v. McDonald Investments, etal., wherein ENA and ECT Thailand are named defendants.

I have reviewed the lawsuit and have determined there is an obligation to defend this entire matter given the allegations associated with "Personal injury", which means injury, other than "bodily injury", arising out of oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services, and/or oral or written publication of material that violates a person's right of privacy.

A review of the Complaint indicates there are allegations associated with Defamation Per Se, Defamation Per Quod, and Invasion of Privacy.  All of the other allegations are predicated on "intentional" conduct/activity, which would not constitute an "occurrence" which has resulted in "bodily injury" or "property damage".  Thus, while we will defend the entire lawsuit, we will only contribute to a settlement or respond to an award for damages associated with the aforementioned counts, assuming such were not made with knowledge of their falsity.

I note suit was filed on February 22, 2001.  As such, please immediately provide me with the following for our file:

*	The identity of defense counsel and a copy of the Engagement Agreement which was provided to them (please include copies of all required monthly billing statements which they have submitted thus far so we can consider reimbursement to the operating company from the date we were first given notice of this matter).
*	Provide a copy of the Answer and any other pleadings filed to-date.
*	Have defense counsel provide their analysis of our alleged exposure, if not done already.
*     Advise who is the assigned ELU Legal Assistant assigned to this matter so we can advise them to copy us on all correspondence going forward.

Following receipt of the above, it may be a good idea to meet and discuss this matter.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

Tracy-- can you look at this and give me a call-35587. I dont understand what it means to us.

As promised, here is my outline of a proposed methodology for allocating the
losses arising from the payments not made to CalPX by SCE and PGE:

1) All participants should be returned to the position they were in before
CalPX issued invoices based on the 90 day charge back provisions in the
tariff.  This will implement the rescission of the 90 day charge back
methodology ordered by FERC.

2) The losses arising from payments not made by a particular buyer for power
purchased during a particular period will be shared pro rata among the
sellers that sold electricity during that period based on the amounts the
sellers are owed for that particular period.

3) The CalPX will not apply any charge back or default allocation to
payments and losses applicable to the real time market for which the CalPX
acts as Scheduling Coordinator.  Instead, CalPX will collect the payments,
if any, and pass them on to the ISO, subject to whatever administrative
charges CalPX is authorized to deduct by the CalPX or ISO tariffs.  Only the
ISO tariff will apply to allocate the losses from payments not made for
power sold and purchased on the real time market.

4) Any payments presently held or hereafter collected and expressly
designated for a particular period and buyer will be applied to the period
and buyer for which such payments are designated.  Any payments presently
held or hereafter collected that are not designated for a particular period
will be applied to the oldest missed payments by the buyer that subsequently
made the payment or on account of which the payment was subsequently
collected.

As I have maintained, this methodolgy may not be perfect for everyone, but,
assuming that it works, it has the appeal of being both simple and
principled.  The CalPX has indicated that it will provide us with feedback
on our approach, but will not formally endorse any particular methodology
because of its concern that it must remain neutral and not appear to support
any group of participants against any other group of participants.

As I have also maintained, until a simple and principled methodology is
adopted, it will be difficult to make any progress with the return of the
letters of credit and the distribution of the funds in the custodial and
escrow accounts.

I believe we should agree upon a workable methodology and then file a motion
with the bankruptcy court on notice to all participants to have the CalPX
authorized and directed to adopt and implement the methodology.  The
participants can then take the order to Judge Moreno to release the letters
of credit and escrowed funds and to FERC to have it formally amend the
tariffs to incorporate the methodology.

Please review the methodology outlined above with your clients so that we
can discuss it in detail during our next conference call.

Thanks.

I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last week's trade press.

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO "backpedal" statements made re: claims of strategic bidding would apply equally to other importers.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT AND OTHER PRIVILEGES

Mark:

I assume that you and Richard are very familiar with the day-to-day developments in the heavily publicized FERC case involving the investigation by FERC of El Paso's sale of pipeline capacity into the CA market to its merchant arm last year that CA officials have partly blamed for the spike in gas and power prices.  As you know, this is the case where the highest executives of El Paso recently were called to testify at FERC.

An article in this morning's New York Times (which begins on page 1), in discussing El Paso's significant earnings generated by the El Paso merchant arm from the pipeline capacity purchase, says that the parties with which El Paso hedged its position also made sizeable profits.  The article notes that about half of El Paso's trades were with Enron "according to people present at the briefings El Paso officials have given to California officials."  While this probably is not surprising in light of our size and breadth in the market, it nonetheless is made to sound somewhat sinister, and my sense is that it is just another potential barb for the CA officials to throw at us.  Since the article quotes a response from Mark Palmer (in which he suggests that Enron, in turn, likely would have resold the capacity and would not have realized the benefit of the rising market), I assumed that you were aware of it, but I thought I would err on the side of putting an extra e-mail in your in-box.

Thanks Richard,

The reason I asked was because our IT people in Houston have told us that we cannot transfer emails that we need beyond the retention period to word documents.  That seemed a bit strange, but they were quite emphatic.   I have clarified the rule with our IT head.

Thanks a lot, and take care,

Sorry for the late reply. You are correct about  the policy. 

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

I have lost track of this. Is there an actual matter? Who is handling?

Works for me.

Deb -- Unless you or Mark Haedicke advise otherwise, Becky Stephens will process SOP for Ste. Aurelie Timberlands as she does for other companies in the Enron Wholesale Group, i.e. Service Recipient -- Richard Sanders; Copy Recipient -- Linda Guinn; ELU Contact -- Bonnie White.

Kate -- Please confirm with Becky when the change of agent has been effected.

Deb and Kate -- During the interim, I understand that service will be handled by the current agent and notice of service will be issued by that agent to whomever Deb has designated. If that is to be Becky during this transition, Deb will need to so instruct the current agent with a copy of the instructions to Becky.

Thanks.

Thanks Deb.  We'll proceed to prepare change of agent forms.  Will you also be able to provide information on officer or director slates?  At present we have no info. at all so we will not be able to get a signature(s) on the forms.

Please advise whether minute books, seals, stock certs., etc. will continue to be maintained by Canadian counsel in Quebec.

Which are the "documents" referred to in your message below?

Thanks for your help.  It's much appreciated.

Best regards
Kate

Good news. 

A slight clarification: SOP is currently made on an individual: John J. Flaherty, 443 Congress St., P.O.Box 11410, Portland, ME 04104-7410.  Mr. J.M.Gagne' of Fasken Martineau Dumoulin, a law firm in Quebec, handles the corporate records but not SOP.  KC

I understand that you have expressed a preference that service of process upon this recently acquired domestic company be received by Canadian counsel. This is contrary to the procedure that we implemented a couple of years ago, whereby a corporate agent has been assigned as agent for service of process relative to all domestic entities affiliated with Enron Corp. in all states. Currently, that agent is NRAI. 

There are two exceptions -- PGE and Limbach. Both of these companies requested and were granted exceptions to the SOP procedure for specific business needs. 

Please provide me the basis for the requested exception as to the captioned company. Of course, we will make every effort to accommodate the specific business needs of this company. Also, please advise whether you or someone on your behalf has determined that the laws in each state in which the company is incorporated and does business permits SOP on a foreign individual.

Thanks.   

   

Please check with John on a later date. By copy of this e-mail, I will ask Stephanie to get alternate dates from you, John,Me, and Jim McCartney and to take the lead on the scheduling. If no other date works, we will go the week of the 16th.

Also- I need you to give dates to Stephanie for the meeting w/me and Mark re your travel schedule.She will take the lead on this one also.

Finally--- I talked to Julia Murray about FCPA training that you were going to do for her group. I think this would be  good PR for you. Please do whatever you can to get them a firm date.

Richard I think the week after that, John wanted to take vacation.  Maybe we should try for the first week in August.  Its winter in South America and it will be a good break from the heat.  I'll check with John.  Otherwise we could do Tuesday- Friday that week of the 16th? That may be tough just returning from vacation.

I have left a message for Jim. I will be getting back from working a week in the Portland office on Sunday, so we would have to leave on Monday. Are any other weeks after that good?

 
Hi Richard,
How about the week of July 16-17?  That works for Novak and me.  I'll make an agenda.  Please check with Jim.

I need to go to San Diego on the 27th for a 3pm hearing. I can probably go that day. Find out what Robin Gibbs is doing and where he is staying. I need to get the first flight back on the 28th.

I was expecting a check from Melanie Gray in the PCA Bankrupty. Call her and get a status report.

Just a reminder that I need Seabram"s "I'll say anything e-mail"

The problem with tapping those funds is that the hogs will get fatter. I think we should vote with our overall theme in mind: the PX participants committee is out of control and anything that curtails them is good.  Is that clear as mud?

There is a committee call Sept. 10 at 12 your time.  It's the regular
weekly committee call.  We may discuss further the arbitration issue
although, for the moment, it would appear that the vote is against making a
demand, at least until after FERC rules.  I won't be surprised however, if
Weg keeps lobbying to try and get the committee to come around on this
issue.  We need to discuss how we will fund the operations. professionals
etc both pending plan confirmation (hopefully early 2002) and after
confirmation.  Weg suggests that we use the earnings on the $400 million
held by PX.  Any thoughts in that regard?  Bob

There is no policy that I know of(don't make me write one)

Richard --

I was wondering if Enron had any formal policies on the release of information?  This is promoted by a call we had from Rep. Waxman's office.  The Rep would like a copy of the 4 page handout that Lay gave to key California Republican leaders in a "private" meeting in Beverly Hills reported in the LA Times recently.

I think that we are going to give this information to Rep. Waxman's office, but we probably want a formal policy (ie, written) that would allow our legislative professionals in DC and elsewhere to say that some info is public and can be provided and other info will not be released.

Appreciate your help.

Jim

Don't do this. Derrick wants me to handle.

	I called and left word after you and I talked.  I didn't hear back so I called her late last week. She left me a voice mail on Friday saying she was out of the office and would call me this week.  I'll continue to follow up.
Did you talk to Elizabeth Labanowski(sp?) re the grand Jury being convened to look at Enron's political contribution?

Can you print this out for me?
If you can't read the letter this time, please let me know and I will just fax it to you.  Thank you.

Here is the form of PG&E letter that we used after consultation with LaBoeuf - it has a few more words.
 

EES wants to terminate energy contracts(futures cintracts) with two bankrupt entities. Can you let Bob Williams know if you have any comments/suggestions to his letter?
Pending Mark Haedicke's okay, here are my suggested termination notices to Unisil and Tri-Valley Growers:

     UNISIL:

                [Date}

                [Jason to provide attorney name]

 

                 Re:  Power Sales Agreement between UniSil Corporation and Enron Energy Marketing Corp., 
                         successor by merger to PG&E Energy Services Corp.("EEMC"), originally entered into
                         between EEMC and UniSil Corp. as of December 5, 1997, and subsequently assigned 
                         to UniSil Acquisition Corp. (the "Agreement")

                  Dear ___________:

                  Pursuant to Section 3.3.2 of the Agreeement and Section 556 of the Bankruptcy Code, EEMC hereby terminates 
                  the Agreement, effective immediately.

                  Very truly yours,  

                   Marcus?

TRI VALLEY GROWERS:

                    [Date]

                    [Marcus--who is Tri Valley Growers' bankruptcy counsel?]

                    
                    Re:  Retail Power Sales Contract between Tri Valley Growers and Enron Energy Marketing Corp., successor 
                           by merger to PG&E Energy Services Corp. ("EEMC"), entered into as of August 28, 1998 (the "Contract")

                    [Same as UniSil except Contract not Agreement]

                      

                  

I am ok. We have gotten into trouble before when we used a different address or fax# that the one contained in the contract. Send it to as many addresses as you have but check the one in the contract.

I'm going to use my one-sentence letter unless you guys have a problem.

The attachment to Ms. Sager's letter did not come with the copy you
forwarded to me, but the text you proposed seems to me to say everything
necessary, and I'm generally in favor of not saying anything more than that.

Section 15.2 of the Unisil agreement gives an address for notices.  If
Unisil Aquisition is still using that address, I would send the notice
there.  Otherwise, I would make sure it gets to Unisil's management.

Rob,

Is my short version okay?  Looks like we've been wordier in the past.

Further to our discussion regarding participation on behalf of Idaho Power =
in the FERC dockets (EL00-95-031, et al), after their call to me this weeke=
nd.  Their interest focuses on sales into and purchases from the ISO and th=
e PX, substantial portions of which remain unpaid.  The sales at issue are =
not from their own generation but are as a marketer.  Idaho expects to asse=
rt that marketer sales must take into account more than the simple price of=
 procurement, but also associated costs and a margin.  Conditions that enha=
nce the creditworthiness of purchasers also are likely to be on Idaho's age=
nda.  The foregoing is provided solely to assure that Enron will not interp=
ose any objection to our role on behalf of Idaho.  I attended the morning s=
ession of the settlement conference before Judge Wagner as an observer, pen=
ding completion of our formal procedures.  Bear in mind that Dan Watkiss of=
 Bracewell & Patterson appeared on behalf of the involved Enron subsidiarie=

As you attempt to reschedule, just remember the crying faces of ten 5 year olds when Coach Sanders isn't there to lead them on to victory.

George can't do it on Monday since he is in Connecticut on Thursday and arranged his schedule to do our meeting on Friday.  I'm still waiting to hear from Greg.  If Greg can do it on Monday, we may have the chance to change till Monday anyway.  I'll let you know later today. . 

Did you switch this? 

        I have scheduled an all day meeting with Greg and Chris, in New York, on Friday, September 21, 2001. At this meeting wwe will discuss the trial plan and, in effect, have a dry run of what we might expect to occur during the October 11 trial.  Please let me know if you are available to attend. I have also asked that, by the end of this week, Brobeck provide us with a summary of the best arguments for and against both sides and an analysis of the realistic exposure to both sides. We can review this before the meeting on the 21st. 

        Also, the two motions for summary judgment we filed are set to be heard on October 1, 2001. The outcome of this hearing (assuming the judge makes a ruling) could certainly affect the tone and scope of the case. Please let me know if you are available on the 21st.  Thanks. 

FYI
Steve Douglas asked me to review and brief you on the pleadings for the Ontario Power tax refund litigation against the United States.  

Ontairo Power, a Canadian coal buyer, claims it is entitled to a refund of unconstitutionally imposed excise tax on coal it bought from several US producers. The IRS is apparently acknowledging that the coal excise tax is unconstitutional as applied to exported coal, and has announced that it will refund taxes improperly levied.  But at issue is whether coal buyers are properly the ones who are due the refund, or whether it more properly belongs to the coal producers.  The IRS says it is separately being sued by 40 coal suppliers, who claim entitlement to the refund, and has therefore asked that all coal producers who have sold coal to Ontario Power be given notice of this proceeding, perhaps as a precursor to an interpleader proceeding.  I presume that that is how we got copies of the pleadings that were forwarded to us.

This suggests to me that Enron should consider filing its own refund claim with respect to any exported coal we have been selling.  It would be useful to get a copy of the pleadings from some of the other producers so that we can use that as a template for our own complaint.  That would also give us a head start in researching some of the relevant legal issues.  We will also want to look at our invoicing to see whether or not the coal excise tax is separately itemized on our bill.  Finally, we will need to get records of our coal exports so we can ascertain how much money is in issue.  For how many years I am not sure; the applicable statute of limitations is one of the items that will need to be researched.   

I will be out of town for the next couple of days, but will be back on Thursday.  Perhaps we can discuss the way forward at that time.

I have been out of the country for the last week, but am in today. I am available anytime this AM.

Richard, please call me so we can discuss directly the question of  
arbitration against SCE for the PX claim of $824 million.  I think its  
important and I would like to discuss it with you personally. 
Second, I am representing Enron's sub, Portland General Electric Company, on  
the Unofficial Committee of Energy Sellers that has about 20 members.  12 of  
the members have voted to send a low key, non threatening message to the  
Calif legislature on the pending AB78X to the effect that if they pass a bill  
that leaves SCE $1 bill short in financing, then other energy sellers (you  
and I know or can guess who they are) will probably feel forced to start an  
involuntary bankruptcy or to start litigation against SCE.  The Unofficial  
Committee was formed to not threaten or pursue bankruptcy or litigation, but  
to pursue consensual repayment.  By creating a cloud of uncertainty over  
whether and when others will start the involuntary bankruptcy, the rating  
agencies and underwriters may not be willing to financing SCE even at the  
reduced rate set forth in the proposed bill.  The 12 members of the  
Unofficial Committee that want to send this message want SCE to avoid a  
Bankruptcy and therefore are suggesting that the Legislature, if it passes AB  
78X, may actually be making it more likely that a BK will ensue. 
Apparently, Doug Nichols at Portland General talked to Lisa Mellencamp about  
this and was told that Portland General should not be part of this low key,  
non threatening message.   
I would like to talk to you directly about this too.  I want to make sure  
that Enron is not missing several opportunities here that will help Enron and  
others.  Please give me a call sometime.  I will be in Sacramento on Tues Sep  
4, but will call you when and where you say. 
I asked Nelson to find out if you would be around to actively participate on  
a subcommittee of the Official Committee on SCE (Sempra and Powerex would be  
the other subcommittee members).  Last time I put you on  a subcommittee, on  
fees, you were too busy to participate.  Please let me know if you really can  
be involved on this important subcommittee on SCE. 
thanks.

I now see who she is. I am happy to go.

Betsy Browning, who has merged her business with DecisionQuest, wants to take us to lunch at Boulevard Bistro next Friday (July 13).  I told her I would ask you.  Can you make it?

Thanks for your e-mail. As it turns out the judge kept the case in San Diego.

I just returned to the office today from a long vacation and wanted to thank
you for taking the time to leave me a voicemail regarding the outcome of the
CalPX beauty contest.  Of course, I'm disappointed, but all of us here
really appreciate your support within the committee.

I also received a message from Neal Manne indicating that you may be
interested in retaining us to represent Enron in the litigation that was
transferred to Judge Whaley in Spokane.  If so, I would be very interested
in discussing that when it's convenient for you.  I will be in the office

We need to talk about this
Steve Douglas asked me to review and brief you on the pleadings for the Ontario Power tax refund litigation against the United States.  

Ontairo Power, a Canadian coal buyer, claims it is entitled to a refund of unconstitutionally imposed excise tax on coal it bought from several US producers. The IRS is apparently acknowledging that the coal excise tax is unconstitutional as applied to exported coal, and has announced that it will refund taxes improperly levied.  But at issue is whether coal buyers are properly the ones who are due the refund, or whether it more properly belongs to the coal producers.  The IRS says it is separately being sued by 40 coal suppliers, who claim entitlement to the refund, and has therefore asked that all coal producers who have sold coal to Ontario Power be given notice of this proceeding, perhaps as a precursor to an interpleader proceeding.  I presume that that is how we got copies of the pleadings that were forwarded to us.

This suggests to me that Enron should consider filing its own refund claim with respect to any exported coal we have been selling.  It would be useful to get a copy of the pleadings from some of the other producers so that we can use that as a template for our own complaint.  That would also give us a head start in researching some of the relevant legal issues.  We will also want to look at our invoicing to see whether or not the coal excise tax is separately itemized on our bill.  Finally, we will need to get records of our coal exports so we can ascertain how much money is in issue.  For how many years I am not sure; the applicable statute of limitations is one of the items that will need to be researched.   

I will be out of town for the next couple of days, but will be back on Thursday.  Perhaps we can discuss the way forward at that time.

Tim/Richard,  Is this procedure approved?   JR

Jenny,

There is no rush on my part with any current requests. Just wanted to be proactive an see where we are at with approval of the procedures so we are prepared for the next request.

Thanks!

DRAFT PROCEDURES -  PENDING APPROVAL BY RICHARD SANDERS

Richard Sanders and Tim Belden have agreed upon the following sign-off procedures:

Tapes:  When we need to access audio tapes to resolve disputed trades or standard settlement questions we will use the standard form authorized with Tim Belden's signature.  Dave and Dan will sort out the logistics of acquiring and listening to the tape.

Data Requests:  Any data requests for data residing in Houston require Tim Belden's signature plus the signature of one attorney.  Richard Sanders may choose to delegate signing authority to Gary Fergus or another litigation attorney by sending an e-mail to this same group.  Dave and Dan will sort out logistics depending on the frequency and complexity of the data requests.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
SoCal Conference Call Highlights

SoCal Conference Call- The following comments are notes from the SoCal conference call for defaulted debt holders, held 1:30 p.m. PDT, 13 July 2001:

Ted Kravner, the SoCal spokesperson, indicated that there are "a lot of bills floating around.  There's not a lot for us to say at this point."  After such a long delay, he stated that, "We are encouraged to see real action at the legislative level."  Also, the company could not comment as to whether the plans made the utility creditworthy; "We are evaluating that with Senate and Assembly leaders."

The spokesperson stated that on Monday the company will make a regular interest payments on the 5 7/8 notes totaling less than $6 M.  The company will also make payments on its other notes; the total amount to be paid will be $27 to $28 M.

Yesterday the CPUC granted the company's motion on the QF fixed rate agreement with the gas cogen and renewable QFs.  The spokesperson stated that the PUC said SoCal can recover all costs associated with its payments to these QFs.

	Appalucia Management Questions to SoCal
	Q:  	Will SCE defer payment on the "quids" notes, which are backed by a trust that has bonds issued against it?
	A: 	Under the terms of the notes SoCal is allowed to defer payment for up to 20 quarters.

	Q:	Would the CPUC, after providing for the DWR to be reimbursed for purchasing power (through the California Procurement Adjustment, or CPA), leave enough revenue for SoCal to remain solvent?  This was based on reports in the press recently that the DWR had requested a 25% rate increase.  
	A:	These reports were "speculation" and were based on numbers that DWR had submitted several weeks ago.  SoCal stated that DWR must update these numbers; therefore, no formal CPUC decision on reimbursing SoCal vis-?-vis DWR can be made at this time.  SoCal indicated that these numbers would be updated "in a few weeks."

	Prudential Questions to SoCal
	Q: 	What bills are currently in process dealing with the MOU?
	A:	There is the Polanco bill, which is the original MOU; the 	Assembly (Hertzberg) bill AB 82XX, which uses the Polanco bill as its foundation; and a Senate bill crafted around Byron Sher's proposals.  SoCal stated that the Sher bill was "less a matter of using Polanco" and approaches the MOU "from a different direction."  SoCal indicated that "people are currently studying the Hertzberg will to see what the components are."

	Q:	What is your (SoCal's) reaction to the negative article in the LA Times today regarding the legislature's perception of the MOU?  
	A:	SoCal responded that "the LA Times sees the glass as half-empty.  By my comments, I see the glass as half-full.  We are optimistic because there something tangible that people are working on.  The fact that Hertzberg's bill uses the governor's MOU as a foundation provides us with a level of optimism."  However, he emphasized that the company was not in a position to say whether any of the bills would make the utility creditworthy.  

	Q:	Can the governor keep the legislature from recessing in order to force them to pass an MOU?
	A:	SoCal responded, "yes, I understand that he does have that power.  We are running out of days.  The situation is becoming more critical.  We are on borrowed time from our creditors now.  Anything that moves us toward creditworthiness, we support."  (NOTE:  In actuality, the Governor can order legislators to the floor for a vote, but they do not have to comply.  As Burton said in the press today, "Only the legislature can force the legislature to stay.")

Deutsche Bank Questions to SoCal
	Q:	Is the transmission asset sale off the table or not?  
	A:	The sale is in the Assembly bill, but we "think it's more of an option in the Senate bill, like it was in the San Diego deal."

	Q:	What are your (SoCal's) thoughts on how the California Procurement Adjustment (CPA) mechanism could be constructed to keep SoCal solvent and if a change in the mechanism for reimbursing the DWR would be needed?
	A:  	"We are highly focused on this."  The spokesperson stated that if 	revenue is distributed in a manner "that puts the utility in a deteriorating balance sheet situation, this will be seen as a very serious situation.  This would be unacceptable.  Our cash position is currently stable.  These changes, this would be a very serious event."

	Q:	Has SoCal reached an agreement on paying the non-renewables or gas-fired QFs 10% of what they are owed? 
	A:	SoCal indicated that it is still in negotiations with 4 of the larger gas-fired QFs (IEP Projects).  SoCal indicated that it would make its 10% payments once the PUC order to pay is final (a 30-day appeal period is still in effect, according to SoCal).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Multiple MOU Plans Debated
California State Budget Faces One Last Hurdle

Budget=20
There is a small possibility that Sen. Burton will not recess the Senate on=
 Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last=
 night (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in It=
aly and is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told to=
 return and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed to =
pass any urgency measure for the budget.  Kuehl's vote is crucial if they t=
ake the bill up on Thursday.=20
MOU Mayhem
There are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by the Calif=
ornia House and Senate deliberations.  Senator Burton is hoping to keep the=
 published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening.  =
Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison =
issue is resolved.  However, rumor is that whether or not they recess on Th=
ursday, their adjournment will mark the end of the Second Extraordinary ses=
sion and all XX  bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days (al=
l others will be dead).  Although Davis has stressed the urgency of passing=
 a comprehensive "bail-out" plan and even threatened to call an emergency s=
ession to prevent legislators from taking a 30-day recess on Friday, there =
is no clear indication that legislators will comply with this request.     =
=20
Hertzberg's bill 82XX - Of the more obvious differences from Davis MOU,  82=
XX proposes to offer SoCal $300 M less for its transmission lines in additi=
on to penalizing Edison if it fails to act in good faith in closing the dea=
l.  It comes as no surprise that during bill deliberations, SoCal raised ob=
jections to the bill and warned of impending difficulties (bankruptcy) for =
So Cal were the bill left unamended.
The Wright-Richman bill 83XX - We reported last week that 83XX remains the =
only measure fueled by bipartisan support.  AB 83XX was heard in an "inform=
ational" hearing yesterday (7-17) and will be heard again today in the Asse=
mbly Energy Committee.  Assemblyman Rod Wright, the Chairman of the Committ=
ee, presented AB 83xx with Dr. Keith Richman, a Republican Assemblyman from=
 Southern California. They offered 83XX as an Edison bail-out, pure and sim=
ple. Wright was clear to distinguish his bill from 82XX, which he said has =
conservation easements and land requisitions, a renewable portfolio which w=
ill add an additional fee on ratepayers, and reasonable review for long ter=
m contracts. While the chances of the Richman bill being successful appear =
slim, reports that that Hertzberg will try to negotiate elements of his own=
 bill (82XX) as amendments to the Wright/Richman measure suggest that at le=
ast Hertzberg feels Richman's 83XX stands a chance.=20

The Byron Sher bill, SB 78XX (Polanco) - Previously presented by Sen. Polan=
co on behalf of Governor Davis, SB 78XX has received special attention from=
 Senate President, John Burton.  Although it has never been heard by a comm=
ittee, SB 78XX is currently on the Senate floor and ready for a vote. The S=
enate Energy Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee are both schedul=
ed to have informational hearings on this bill today.  Note, the meetings a=
re informational because neither committee has possession of the bill.  The=
se hearings will provide information to committee members, avoid a formal v=
ote, and simultaneously shield Burton/Polanco from claims that the details =
of SB78XX were never released.  The Senate is scheduled to be in session to=
morrow, ostensibly to vote on the state budget and SB 78XX. Given Burton's =
penchant for wanting to keep on schedule to recess tomorrow, there is no gu=
arantee that he will hold the Senate in session once they hear SB 78XX. Thu=
s, the Senate may never even see AB 82XX and AB 83XX unless either or both =
bills are passed out of the Assembly today and get special treatment by Bur=
ton to be heard tomorrow. Burton has previously adjourned the Senate to kee=
p on schedule once they finish their business, even if the Assembly is behi=
nd them.

We have not had any disputes in my 3.5 years and none that I am aware of in the past.

Mark/Richard

We are looking at a possible dispute with Dynegy in relation a UK electricity trading contract.

Part of our assessment of whether we want to resolve the issue by expert determination rather than by compromise is going to be driven by the extent to which we feel we need to make the point to Dynegy that we are prepared to square up for a fight when we need to and not compromise.

In making this assessment our relationship with Dynegy in the US (and elsewhere) - in particular whether we have or have had any/many disputes with Dynegy - will be very instructive.

Please could you drop me a quick email or vmail with a thumb-nail sketch of any current and past disputes with Dynegy.

Many thanks

Paul

When is the hearing and what is the likelihood of it going forward on that date?
on Friday, plaintiff filed two briefs: one omnibus brief in oppostion to all of the substantive motions filed by all of the defendants, and another brief in opposition to the 2 sanctions motions, one filed by us and the other by mcdonald.  the briefs are littered with expressions of indignation and outrage, and dwell on plaintiff's counsel's condemnation of large firms and large clients willing to expend any amount of money and hours to bury the plaintiff - and the court - in paper.  as to actual substance, the briefs are very light, as well as confusing.

specifically w/r to the issues raised by the enron motions, plaintiff presumably took the omnibus approach to further blur the distinctions between the defendants, and obscure the fact that he didn't make particular allegations about any enron conduct. obviously, this will be a core focus of our response.

copies will be fed ex'd to you all overnight.   if you have any comments, reactions, or suggestions, please call.  otherwise we hope to have  draft replies to you all by the end of the week.  our filing date is a week from today.

The Rio Piedras Explosion Litigation note needs to be updated. My suggested=

ld.  Please let me know if you have any questions are comments.

____________=20

On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in *** the Humberto Vidal Build=
ing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily =
injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Juan Gas =
Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air di=
stribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the build=
ing. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were=
 named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puert=
o Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath C=
onsultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers,=
 in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puer=
to Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for=
 wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage=
 allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without determi=
ning the cause of the explosion, all parties *** agreed not to litigate fur=
ther that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to de=
termine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and=
, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants ***=
 agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have bee=

the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001. No cases h=

3. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES=20
Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of=
 which are discussed below. Although no assurances can be given, Enron beli=
eves, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate res=
erves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such item=
s, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impac=
t on Enron's financial position or results of operations.=20
Litigation. In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris =
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intr=
atex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, t=
he Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron. =
The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas pur=
chase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated. Early in 1996=
, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherw=
ise resolved) separately. In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that =
the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in con=
nection with the "Panhandle program," a special marketing program establish=
ed in the early 1980s. This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in =
a verdict for the Enron Defendants. In the second matter, the Plaintiffs al=
lege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and c=
ertain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratabl=
y with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988. The tri=
al court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims. On Mar=
ch 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class cert=
ification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court. The Enron =
Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmativ=
e defenses, including the statute of limitations. The Enron Defendants beli=
eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorou=
sly contest the claims. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes=
 that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adv=
erse effect on its financial position or results of operations.=20
On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal=
 Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, b=
odily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Jua=
n Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/=
air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the=
 building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carrier=
s were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The=
 Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, H=
eath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance car=
riers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District o=
f Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damag=
es for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property =
damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without d=
etermining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litig=
ate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trial=
s to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explos=
ion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defenda=
nts have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims =
have been settled. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that=
 the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse =
effect on its financial position or results of operations.=20
Trojan Investment Recovery. In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) =
ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility=
. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a genera=
l rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining inv=
estment in Trojan.=20
The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigat=
ion in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appea=
ls and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to th=
e OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens =
Utility Board (CUB).=20
In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of t=
he OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investmen=
t in the Trojan plant. Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw fro=
m the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the =
Trojan litigation. The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements=
 of the settlement on September 29, 2000. As a result of these approvals, P=
GE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to custome=
rs, either through a return on or a return of that investment. Collection o=
f ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement=
 agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order. With the CUB's withdrawal=
, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.=
 The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC orde=
r allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan.=20
Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions. Although no assurances c=
an be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters w=
ill not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results=
 of operations.=20
Environmental Matters. Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and loc=
al environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require e=
xpenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the oper=
ation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites=
. The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result =
in increased operating expenses. These increased operating expenses are not=
 expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or result=
s of operations. Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and gr=
oundwater remediation on a number of their facilities. Enron does not expec=
t to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater re=
mediation.

Thanks for the update.

We had the shortest call in history today.  We discussed Edison.  Edison
withdrew its opposition to our employment of professionals and will be
producing documents in response to our 2004 notice.  There's been some
speculation about whether parties will be filing an involuntary petition
against SCE.  Reliant wasn't on our call today and I couldn't help but
wonder whether they were busy with other things.  In that regard, Howard
Weg is establishing an SCE subcommittee and wants us to participate.
What's your position.  As to Edison, there's a reasonable likelihood now
that the legislature will approve a package that (1) has no funding to pay
us, (2) permits Edison to use funds to pay dividends on preferred stock and
(3) waives Edison's commandeering claims.  As to the last issue, Kaye
Scholer opines that Edison's waiver will have no impact on the PX's right
to pursue the commandeering suit.  This week there will be several meetings
aimed at finalizing a reorganization plan.  We'll have a report during our
next call which is scheduled Sept,. 17 at 1 LA time.  Weg is consulting
with FERC lawyers about presentation of his proposed settlement.  He plans
to proceed fairly soon both before FERC and in the bankruptcy court.  Bob
Nelson

I have asked my asst. to put a meeting together.

Richard:  We have a general discussion of California in our current SEC fil=
ings, but it is not included in the Litigation footnote.  Once we start put=
ting the California discussion in the Litigation footnote, it pretty much s=
tays there until all this goes away (which I assume could take years).  Gar=
y: would you please send to Richard our current discussion of California th=
at appeared in the first Quarter 10-Q.  Richard: I have tried to keep up to=
 speed with our cases trough yours and Vicki Sharp's monthly litigation rep=
orts, but perhaps we could get together for just a few minutes next week at=
 your convenience to discuss the status of the cases and the FERC proceedin=
gs.  thanks for your help.  Rex=20

Are we doing anything on California and do you need my input?
The Rio Piedras Explosion Litigation note needs to be updated. My suggested=

3. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES=20
Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of=
 which are discussed below. Although no assurances can be given, Enron beli=
eves, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate res=
erves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such item=
s, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impac=
t on Enron's financial position or results of operations.=20
Litigation. In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris =
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intr=
atex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, t=
he Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron. =
The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas pur=
chase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated. Early in 1996=
, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherw=
ise resolved) separately. In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that =
the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in con=
nection with the "Panhandle program," a special marketing program establish=
ed in the early 1980s. This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in =
a verdict for the Enron Defendants. In the second matter, the Plaintiffs al=
lege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and c=
ertain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratabl=
y with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988. The tri=
al court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims. On Mar=
ch 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class cert=
ification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court. The Enron =
Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmativ=
e defenses, including the statute of limitations. The Enron Defendants beli=
eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorou=
sly contest the claims. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes=
 that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adv=
erse effect on its financial position or results of operations.=20
On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal=
 Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, b=
odily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Jua=
n Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/=
air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the=
 building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carrier=
s were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The=
 Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, H=
eath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance car=
riers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District o=
f Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damag=
es for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property =
damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without d=
etermining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litig=
ate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trial=
s to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explos=
ion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defenda=
nts have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims =
have been settled. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that=
 the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse =
effect on its financial position or results of operations.=20
Trojan Investment Recovery. In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) =
ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility=
. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a genera=
l rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining inv=
estment in Trojan.=20
The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigat=
ion in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appea=
ls and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to th=
e OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens =
Utility Board (CUB).=20
In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of t=
he OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investmen=
t in the Trojan plant. Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw fro=
m the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the =
Trojan litigation. The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements=
 of the settlement on September 29, 2000. As a result of these approvals, P=
GE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to custome=
rs, either through a return on or a return of that investment. Collection o=
f ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement=
 agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order. With the CUB's withdrawal=
, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.=
 The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC orde=
r allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan.=20
Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions. Although no assurances c=
an be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters w=
ill not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results=
 of operations.=20
Environmental Matters. Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and loc=
al environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require e=
xpenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the oper=
ation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites=
. The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result =
in increased operating expenses. These increased operating expenses are not=
 expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or result=
s of operations. Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and gr=
oundwater remediation on a number of their facilities. Enron does not expec=
t to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater re=
mediation.

We now have a refund order from FERC which I have not yet  read. The issue =
of ENA's liability is, as you would guess, complicated. Are we still on tra=
ck for a short meeting to discuss?

9.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

   Developments in the California Power Market.  During
2000, prices for wholesale electricity in California
significantly increased as a result of a combination of
factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in
available hydroelectric generation resources, increased
demand, over-reliance on the spot market for electricity and
limitations on supply.  California's regulatory regime
instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but
froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting
disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues
caused two of California's public utilities, Pacific Gas &
Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison
Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale
power costs and certain obligations related to the
difference between third party power purchase costs and
frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and SCE have
defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain
outstanding obligations, including wholesale power purchased
through the California Power Exchange (the Power Exchange),
from the California Independent System Operator (the
Independent System Operator), and from qualifying
facilities.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each
have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.

   Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the
energy situation in California have been implemented or are
being pursued, and may result in restructuring of markets in
California and elsewhere.  Additional initiatives are likely
at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not
possible to predict their outcome at this time.

   Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with
California utilities, the Power Exchange, the Independent
System Operator, end users of energy in California, and
other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of these
entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such
activities and believes that the combination of such
reserves in accounts receivables and price risk management
assets and other credit offsets with such parties are
adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the
California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involved,
the ultimate outcome of the California power situation
cannot be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will
not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial
condition or results of operations.

   India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting
interest in Dabhol Power Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740
megawatt power plant and is developing an additional 1,444
megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasification
facility in India.  Enron accounts for its investment in
Dabhol under the equity methodand the debt of Dabhol is non-
recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of
power from Dabhol, and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM)
and the federal government of India (GOI), the guarantors of
payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project
documents.  The contract disputes relate principally to the
failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity and energy
payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM and GOI
to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project
documents.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able
to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully
collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement.
However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actions are in
clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends
to pursue all available legal remedies under the project
documents.  Accordingly, Enron does not believe that any
contract dispute related to Dabhol would have a material
adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of
operations.

   Termination of Portland General Sales Agreement.  On
April 26, 2001, Enron announced that the previously
disclosed agreement to sell Portland General to Sierra
Pacific Resources had been terminated by the mutual consent
of both parties because the effect of developments in
California and Nevada on the purchaser had made completion
of the transaction impractical.

what does this mean?

You have more than 2 report(s) with receipts outstanding

You are only allowed 2 reports with receipts outstanding.  Your expense reports will not be paid until you meet this requirement.

Jim--- I have talked to Tim. He is ok. Call me if you have any Q's.
With the FERC evidentiary hearings coming up soon for California and with investigations into NW power markets I want to make sure that the litigation team's activities and government affair's activities are coordinated.  Is this being done?  Is there a formal process?  If there are data issues or data that you need I would like to get those issues on the table right now.  Specifically, do we have all of the data that we need (for both of your purposes) and do the people on the litigation team have a detailed understanding of this data?  There are only a few people who understand how all of our data fits together and what each type of transaction means.  As the investigation move from Californa to the Northwest markets I may have to get other people from the desk involved.

Tim

This is our judge in Sacramento.

Should I do anything about this. It is getting ridiculous.
Anthony Duenner's group is headquartered in Singapore.  Anthony and Fred Cohagan are in Singapore (with about three or four others, including a new government affairs  person).  Anthony also has people in Tokyo (1), Sydney (2) and Seoul (2).  I think it would be great if you could include them in your training.  I'd be happy to help you coordinate with Anthony and Fred.  Thanks, Michelle

Michelle what EBS locations in Asia need FCPA training?  I am in the process of planning training  for Korea and perhaps China in August as requested  by Darrel Kinder and others and would like to coordinate the effort to train as many people as possible to be more efficient.

Judge Whaley's decision granting the plaintiffs' remand motions is attached=
.
Judge Whaley held that, while the filed rate doctrine may well constitute a=
n
"absolute defense,"  it does not support complete preemption sufficient to
provide federal jurisdiction.  While not the result we wanted, that aspect
of the decision was not unexpected.  Also, at several points, Judge Whaley
confirmed the "central and controlling role" the federal government plays i=
n
the regulation of wholesale energy issues.

Unfortunately, the decision also includes Judge Whaley's view that
plaintiffs can state claims under the Cartwright Act and UCL statute
"without alleging or establishing that the electric rates charged were not
'just and reasonable'". Decision at 14-16.   While not binding on the state
court, plaintiffs will no doubt seek to make use of these and other portion=
s
of Judge Whaley's decision to oppose our state court pleading challenge.

I'll set up a conference call in the next day or so to discuss status and
approach in light of the remand decision.

The atty was transferred to me from Haedicke's office. I have no idea where they got Mark's # and name.His name is Dave Parkinson 801-323-3208. He is out of Salt Lake City.

	Drew, I got your voice-mail, which included Richard's voice-mail to you.  I have an open file on this breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit between the above-referenced characters, and have been dealing with informal discovery responses from both.  If it is the same lawsuit, I am surprised that I have not been given a call about any deposition of Stan Horton.  I am asking Becky to follow up with Richard about who he got the telephone call from, and compare that with the attorneys of record we know about.

	I will be on the road most of the day driving to Fort Worth for a family reunion.  I will have my cell phone (713-252-7711).  Hopefully, we won't need to do anything until Monday, but if that is not the case, I will make sure this gets handled.

I spoke to Rick McCombs at Mayer Brown this morning and he informed me that he is in trial all week and unavailable for a call today. We agreed to a 7am central (1pm London and 8am New York) call on Thurs. to go over the answer and any other pending items. He promised a draft answer by  3 pm central on Wed afternoon. Hopefully, Paul will be well by then. I will set up a call-in number for the conference..
 
I am trying to set up a conf. call today at 10:30 central to speak to the Chicago attys. Andy is not involved in this case. 
 
Mark, fyi
Paul J is away sick but asked me to deal with this.  I have also discussed with Paul S.  Conference call planned for 2pm today with Andy Edison to discuss this (and Kemper).
 
Let's keep the pressure up by all means but I understand that an extension of this period is not hard to come by. 
 
I assume you're talking about that with Andy, Paul J.

Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.

Ken Lay and Andy Fastow are meeting with Willie Brown and another rep from his office and the CIO and CEO of CalPERS on Monday August 6th at 1 pm in New York.

FYI. This meeting has to do with the Calpers "investigation" of its JEDI investment with Enron. As you know, Willie Brown is the mayor of SF. The city of SF is the lead plaintiff in one of the class actions.

Please handle

THIRD request!  Many of you haven't granted calendar access rights to our L=
egal Dept. Temporary IDs.  The temporaries that fill in for our Assistants =
need this access not only to set up meetings and keep your calendars curren=
t, but to refer to in case there's an emergency and you need to be found.

Assistants:  It is helpful if you block the time on your bosses' calendars =
for their vacations and trips.  That way when we call up the calendars the =
temps won't have to guess how to answer their calls.   ("I don't know where=
 they are" is not an acceptable answer!)

Please follow the instructions below.=20

 the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to O=
utlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights =
to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control h=
ow much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you coul=
d give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail =
or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to y=
ou.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8

To set up access:
1.=09Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your=
 folders list is not visible, click on "View" and

2.=09Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.=09Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.=09Left click on "Add".
=09Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
=09Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add"=
 button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
=09to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
=09Left Click "OK"

5. =09You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID =
you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then

Your welcome. What was the name of the Dude ranch you described?

Dear Richard:

Tammie and I want to thank you and Julie for inviting us to the Astro's game
on Saturday.  We had a great time, both at the game and afterwards.  Those
were the best seats I have ever had for a professional sporting event.  We
will have to try and get together more often for simple activities like
cards or Scrabble or just drinks and talk.  We hope to have the house
settled before the end of the month and can have people over without having
to apologize for the mess.
Thanks again for the good time

Jim Ebeling

Yes, please sign it.

Richard, this relates to the former EI litigation.  I will be glad to sign unless you want to.
Robert,

Attached is the electronic version of the 2nd Quarter legal letter, as
requested in prior quarters.  Please note the date of sign-off.

Thank you in advance!

El Paso Corporation Responds to Mischaracterizations and Inaccurate Reports=
 Of FERC Hearing
HOUSTON, Aug. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news) bel=
ieves that it is necessary to respond to continuing mischaracterizations an=
d inaccurate press reports regarding the recently completed Federal Energy =
Regulatory Commission (FERC) hearing in which it participated. This distort=
ed coverage has fostered unwarranted fears in the marketplace fueled by mis=
understandings about the nature of the FERC proceeding, the testimony and e=
vidence presented, and the applicable regulatory standards.

``I am very concerned that the investing public has been misled by recent r=
eports describing the current state of a FERC proceeding and quoting commen=
ts made by the presiding FERC administrative law judge,'' said William A. W=
ise, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of El Paso Corporatio=
n. ``These reports have seriously mischaracterized El Paso's actions and th=
e legal standards by which those actions must be measured. I am confident t=
hat once the facts are fairly evaluated and the appropriate legal standards=
 are applied, El Paso will be vindicated. Despite the heated rhetoric by th=
e complaining parties and comments by the administrative law judge himself,=
 El Paso believes as a matter of law and fact that the complaining parties =
have not met their burden of proof and no burdens of proof have shifted. No=
 other legally sustainable conclusion can be reached.''

The following facts are necessary to a complete and accurate understanding =
of this administrative proceeding. In April 2000, the California Public Uti=
lities Commission (CPUC) filed a complaint with the FERC, alleging that El =
Paso Natural Gas Company (EPNG) improperly awarded capacity on its pipeline=
 to an affiliated energy marketing company, El Paso Merchant Energy (EPME).=
 It was also alleged that EPME had improperly been granted a discount on th=
e Mojave pipeline system in violation of the FERC's marketing affiliate rul=
es and had unlawfully exercised market power. For almost a year thereafter,=
 FERC reviewed and evaluated comments submitted by all parties and extensiv=
e evidence and documents that El Paso produced. On March 28, 2001, the FERC=
 issued an order based on this evidence that addressed all three issues.

With respect to the CPUC's allegations regarding violations of the affiliat=
e regulations, FERC ruled, in an unanimous decision, that:

The current El Paso contracts were awarded following an open season that

was conducted in accordance with Commission rules and policies. The

Commission finds no merit in the allegations that the bidding process ...

was skewed to favor El Paso Merchant and that El Paso Merchant possessed

certain information concerning a discount that was not available to other

bidders. Further, the Commission has examined the evidence and does not

find a violation of the Standards of Conduct for Interstate Pipelines

with Marketing Affiliates.

That same order specifically discussed the very telephone transcripts that =
have been the subject of recent press coverage. Notwithstanding certain pub=
lic observations of the administrative law judge in the current hearing, th=
e Commission unanimously concluded that ``the transcripts do not indicate t=
hat Mojave's Transportation Marketing Negotiator agreed to the tiered arran=
gement sought by El Paso Merchant Energy.'' That order unequivocally held t=
hat the conversation reported in the transcripts is not an affiliate standa=
rd violation, concluding that under the marketing affiliate regulations, ``=
Mojave was under no obligation to post affiliate discount information until=
 the time at which gas first flowed under the transaction.''

The market power issues were set for an evidentiary hearing, which commence=
d on May 14, 2001, and concluded in June.

On June 11, 2001, the FERC granted rehearing of its March decision solely t=
o resolve any factual issues raised by the allegations of the CPUC's compla=
int concerning affiliate abuse and violation of the FERC's Standards of Con=
duct. That hearing commenced on August 2 and concluded on August 6. EPNG, E=
PME, and the CPUC each called one witness to testify on these issues. The C=
PUC presented no new facts or evidence and relied solely on the same docume=
nts that the unanimous Commission had ruled failed to prove any of the alle=
ged affiliate violations.

Since the FERC's unanimous March 28 decision was rendered on the basis of t=
he same facts that are now a part of the evidentiary record before the judg=
e, there should be no legal basis for the Commission to change that decisio=
n when the case returns to it.

``Contrary to press reports, El Paso's senior executives did not refuse to =
appear at the hearing,'' said Mr. Wise. ``The judge requested that some exe=
cutives be available to answer his questions, and El Paso made them availab=
le for that purpose. At the appropriate time, El Paso raised several legal =
objections to any further El Paso witnesses being required to testify. Cont=
rary to press reports, the judge agreed with El Paso's arguments and there =
was no further questioning of the executives. The hearing then concluded.''

The evidence in the hearing also establishes that there is no basis for the=
 allegations of market power abuse. During the period from June 2000 to Mar=
ch 2001, when the price of natural gas in California was sharply increasing=
, pipeline capacity was plainly not being withheld from the marketplace. In=
stead, the evidence demonstrates that during this crucial period, 95 percen=
t of the available capacity on EPNG's pipeline was being utilized. In fact,=
 on many days utilization by EPNG's customers amounted to 100 percent of th=
e pipeline's available capacity. During the same period, EPNG's customers u=
tilized approximately 97 percent of the pipeline's available capacity into =
southern California, the region where the complaining parties allege that p=
rices were significantly higher than in the rest of California. Thus, the o=
bjective data conclusively demonstrate that at the times when the complaini=
ng parties allege that pipeline capacity was used to manipulate natural gas=
 prices, the capacity on EPNG's pipeline was not being withheld, and that t=
he high natural gas prices were clearly caused by other factors now widely =
recognized to be responsible for the shortages experienced.

All briefs in the proceeding must be filed by September 7, 2001, and the ju=
dge has stated he will issue his proposed decision by October 9, 2001. In t=
he event that the judge reaches a decision adverse to El Paso on the market=
 power issue, or reaches a different conclusion on the affiliate issues tha=
n was reached by the full Commission in March 2001, El Paso will appeal the=
 decision to the full Commission and, if necessary thereafter, the courts.

``I am confident that, when appropriate legal standards are applied to this=
 case, we will be vindicated. The law and the facts are on our side,'' said=
 Mr. Wise.

El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North A=
merica and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from =
wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of=
 new energy sources to address critical energy shortages across the globe. =

Can we talk today. Call me at 713-853-5587. If I am not in set a time with my asst.

I just participated in a conference call of the PX committee.  Our counsel
are urging the committee to clear them to commence an arbitration action to
recover the PX's claim against SCE.  This may be followed by a judicial
action seeking prejudgment relief in the form of an attachment.  A written
memo will be circulated shortly to the committee summarizing this course of
action.  The view seems to be that SCE has all but assured that it will be
suing PX and all the participants, and why not take the initiative.  Any
thoughts?

Who is this? Can you send him to Linda?

How about 2 my time?

I'll try you around 1 your time.At 08:49 AM 8/13/01 -0500, you wrote:

This is ok. Lets review them in the SF Enron office.

Richard,
  Peter Meringolo, from Brobeck, has requested copies of email files and documents be made for review at the Brobeck offices.  My recommendation is that the review be made at the Enron offices and that only those files that pertain to the case be copied (or printed) to take to Brobeck's offices.  I'd like to minimize the amount of non-pertinent information that leaves our control.  Attached is the message I sent to Dave on this issue.  If you feel it is most appropriate to give them copies of everything, I understand, I just wanted to convey the risks and obtain your acceptance.
  The office manager in San Francisco has had arrangements in place (for the last month) so that Brobeck could review the documents in the San Francisco office.  I understand from Peter that they are getting much closer to needing to complete the review, so if you can let me know what route you decide on that would be great.  THanks.  -gabriella

Director, Business Controls & Security

Dave,
  	Peter Meringolo, from Brobek, has sent me a request to create copies of Sue Mara's, Mike McDonald's and your email files and documents so that they can be reviewed at Brobeck's offices.  I recommend that the email files and documents be reviewed at your offices, and if necessary, only those messages and documents responsive to the subpoena be copied electronically for use at the Brobeck offices. (The issue with making electronic copies of material is that once it is out of our control we will no longer have any idea of how many copies were made, who had access to the material, or know how it was stored and protected.  Therefore, it is in our best interest to reduce the information copied electronically to only what is essential.)  If printing is adequate then I would recommend that Brobeck print the documents that are responsive to the subpoena. 
 	April has set up appropriate access to the system and files so that they can be reviewed in your office spaces.  I have spoken with Peter and promised that I would get your input (as well as Richard Sanders) on the issue.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  Best regards.  -gabriella

P.S.  I have placed some comments in red next to each of Peter's points.

Gabriella,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the copying of email and electronic
documents in the possession of certain employees in Enron's San Francisco
office.  As we discussed, this email sets forth our request and our reasons
this request.  I truly appreciate you discussing this issue with Richard
Sanders and Dave Parquet.  

REQUEST:  We request that Enron copy onto CD's certain electronic documents
and emails in the possession of Dave Parquet, Sue Mara and Mike McDonald.
Thereafter, we will review these documents and produce only those documents
and emails that are responsive to subpoenas from the California Senate and
the California Attorney General.  The documents and emails we request to be
copied likely contain documents and emails not responsive to these two
outstanding subpoenas.  

REASONS FOR REQUEST:  You raise valid concerns with our proposal insofar as
we ask for copies of documents and emails that are not responsive to the
subpoenas.  We believe our proposal is the best approach for following
reasons:

	(1) We can accurately keep control of what we have reviewed, what we
have deemed responsive, and what we have deemed privileged.  (Folders can be set up for filing and tracking these documents. -gc)

	(2) We can re-review materials in the likely event of further
subpoenas or documents requests.  (All documents and emails are to be retained so that they will be available for future reviews. -gc)

	(3) We can review the materials in the least disruptive manner
possible -- on our own computers and in our offices. (Operating from your office may be an inconvenience, but it minimizes the risk of losing control of sensitive documents that have no bearing on the case. -gc)

	(4) We can review at the pace dictated by the litigation, which is
unpredictable (to say the least).  (As long as access to your office spaces and the system is made available this should not be an issue. -gc)

Concerns about security and confidentiality are common in all litigation and
document review.  We always take these concerns seriously.  We will restrict
access to these documents to only those persons involved with reviewing and
organizing the documents.  We will work with you to ensure that these
documents will remain in strict confidence.

Again, I truly appreciate your taking the time to discuss these matters with
me as well as with Dave and Richard.  If there is any further information
you need, please do not hesitate to ask.  

Very truly yours, 

Peter Meringolo

Probably not If it is for NSM we might have it in McConville's old files. If it is Qualitech then I don't have it.

do you have this document please?
Lou,
 
I think Richard Sanders would have the other O&M agreement.  Do you want me to get with him or do you want to ask him for it?
 
Tammy

sounds good to me too...let me know how i can help.....did anyone ever find the O& M Ageement that sdi did on the other plant(?)

Sounds good.  Let me know if I can assist.

I think we can put together a list of major topics that need clarification/discussion w/SDI, so those attending the meeting can deliver the message, if appropriate.  I suggest we (TD) take a shot at the first draft and circulate it later today.  Any other suggestions are welcome.
JC

do we need to meet before you go to sdi?

Thanks Lou. 
 
After the meetings on 8/16-17, we should have a much clearer path to follow regarding SDI and Trico. 
 
I am anticipating that very soon after 8/16-17, we will be working closely in conjunction with SDI to develop a joint proposal.  Part of the discussion on 8/16-17 will be exclusivity, responsibilities, and resource allocation. All of these assumptions, of course, are dependent upon a positive response from SDI, and to date, there has been nothing to indicate that we wouldn't receive a positive response.

glad to sit down any time and brainstorm a couple of alternatives given the factors and be able to put something in front of sdi on an expedited basis....just let me know if and how i can help
 
Lou
 
 

Trico update: 

I spoke with CSFB and told them that we are not at this time prepared to accelerate our bid process in keeping with their request earlier today to complete our due diligence this week and mark up the contract.

They will still provide us the opportunity to visit the data room and will also still forward us a copy of the contract.  But they will proceed with the other party on the accelerated timeline as a stalking horse bidder.  

The big unknown is will we be able to develop a structure with SDI that works and is quick  enough to participate in the final round of bids.

Enrique and/or Javier, 

please forward copy of Trico bid to Lou. 

Lou, latest information from Jeff McMahon via Tim B is that we will not agree to the accellerated pace as offered by CSFB. We will be meeting with SDI on the 16th and 17th to discuss a joint approach to the assets and most likely to prepare for our response during the 20 day pre-auction date.

We will keep you informed as events further develop.  ANy advice/information from Bracewell regarding the bidding process and whether CSFB's proposed accelerated timeline can even be met?

Thanks, 

Tim 

could someone pls forward me a copy of the signed prelim bid...thanks 

Lou 

Hello Lou, 

Would you forward to me and ammy the timeline of the Trico assets through to completion of sale of assets. I need to recieve this as soon as possible for a meeting with Jeff McMahon and SDI.

If you need to compare notes with me, I will be happy to contribute. 

Thank you, 

Tim 

Did this get any press? If so,send me any articles you may have.

FYI.

Senator Ray Haynes (R) held a press conference this morning to discuss a
report his office produced regarding municipal utility energy charges.
Twelve reporters attended the press conference.  According to Senator
Haynes, none of municipal utilities provided him with documentation or
assistance with his report.  Senator Haynes delivered the report to Senator
Dunn and has requested that he open an investigation into municipal utility
practices.  He also expressed continued disappointment over the Senate's
unwillingness to adopt his legislative amendment which would establish a
windfall profit's tax for municipal utilities.

Senator Haynes referenced Enron several times by comparing Enron's rates to
those rates charged by LADWP and SMUD.

In developing the report, Senator Haynes' office did not analyze peak versus
off peak energy prices, what percentage of power was being sold by municipal
utilities, or, what the cost for producing or procuring power was for the
municipal utilities.  These items were raised by a reporter.  After the
press conference, reporters met privately with SMUD and other municipal
utilities who defended their actions and refuted Senator Haynes' claims.

I was able to obtain one copy of the report and will FedEx it to Karen in
Houston.

Richard, this is a heads up, in the event you deem it appropriate to make a claim on this in the PG&E Bankruptcy proceeding.  The amount communicated to us by CAISO is $33,838,246.08 that we are owed under the underscheduling penalty.  Please call if you need additional info.  Ray

Hey, this is what we've been looking for! Steve, let me knwo when you get the nfo from the ISO

IMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September
5th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in
part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the
underscheduling penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the
underscheduling penalty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are
several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty,
to date the ISO has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing
pursuant to the underscheduling penalty.  It is our expectation that
Scheduling Coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they
schedule, information that is relevant to them.
As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles
transactions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized
nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market
Participants in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of "ISO
Debtors" against "ISO Creditors" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further,
while the ISO may be asked by an "ISO Debtor" to assert such claims in the
PX or PG&E bankruptcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will
decline any such request.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any
Market Participant's claims, whether or not the Market Participant files any
such proofs of claim in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings.
Further, as we have advised in prior Market Notices, all statements,
including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty,
are subject to change.  A number of transactions are currently known to be
the subject of disputes and market reruns.  There are also proceedings
pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and State Courts, the outcomes of which may
affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Market Participant or by the Market
Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anticipate that further disputes and
proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect
the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO will continue to work diligently
to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.  Nonetheless, it is clear
that significant issues may remain unresolved and/or unidentified by the
claims bar date.
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their
respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX
and PG&E.

Whatever happened to this?

We are considering this as a response to an allegation that Enron should consider itself responsible for Visual Bridge liabilities.

Attached is an initial draft of a proposed response to the letter to Gene from Global Production.  It goes without saying that we need to make sure that the facts stated our consistent with our records.  It may very well say more than we want to say as well.  Nevertheless, with the view that it is easier to take out than add, I have restated some points.  In addition, since I think we may be sending something like this out to more than one VBI creditor, it may be worth setting up a format that we can re-use.  Anyway, please review and lets talk about the content and the timing of a response.

Robert H. George

In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.  However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.  

At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.  As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty.  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.

The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.

Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding.

Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.

thanks

Dunne told Bev that he (the committee?) intends to take up the contempt vote against us as soon as possible in September.  Apparently, he thinks they will prevail in Superior Court.  
He also said that, even though there's been alot of paper submitted by the generators, it's his sense that many are not in compliance and that more tussles are likely.  
Finally, he said that he suspects that generators will sue the committee when the committee starts the deposition process in September.

Best,
Jeff

Only if you say I have to.

DecisionQuest has asked to make a one-hour presentation to us.  Any interest?

Here is the CAISO's documentation showing that EPMI is entitled to $33.8 million in underscheduling penalty revenues for the period of Jan-Apr '01.

Here you go.

Let me know if anyone has any questions on this information.

  This is what will be sent out in the mail.  It is not as detailed as what I sent Chris previously.  This shows a payment to Enron.

I am the soccer coach for Daniel and the asst coach for Ben. Our weekends are booked up until early Nov. Can we schedule a workweek for the? Sorry.

1)  We would like to use the Perd on Oct 5- 8th. 
2)  We need to organize a family clean up weekend at the Perd.  This has not  
been done in over two years...and the Perd really really needs it.  Does  
anyone have any suggestions on when to do this and how....and what age  
children come or without children.  But the cooler months are coming...and we  
should try to do it before the holidays. 
3)  Mom is turning 70 this December.  What in the world sould we do to top  
Dad's 60 surprise birthday party for her.  Any ideas of a present.....or a  
plan.  We should talk about this now if we need to plan something. 
4)  There is someone in my neighborhood selling a cargo bunkbed with good  
mattresses for $300.  Should we buy this for the Perd.  It also has a pull  
out trundle bed.  Great condition and great price. 
Please get back with me.  Happy delayed birthday greeting to Yvonnne....and  
Susan early birthday greetings to you.

Sorry I have been less than diligent in getting back to you, although I tried to call today. As David Burns may have told you, I was active at first(when I thought my role as comm. member was limted) I have not been active lately because almost all the lawyers involved in this case seem to only motivated to prolong the case.There is alot of money being spent on nothing. Now I see this Budget. Unbelievable. I am available tomorrow aft. please have your asst. call Twanda Sweet 853-9402 to set it up. Have you talked to anyone else?

I would like to try and schedule a convenient time to discuss with you the
role/scope of the PX Participants Committee.  Reliant has been concerned
for some time about the continued life line of the PX and this committee
and the additional layer of expenses that are being incurred (see BDO's
recent analysis of the PX budget for example).  It seems to me that the
sole role of the PX and the committee (other than with respect to
litigation that has already commenced such as the commandeering litigation)
aught to be limited to (i) record/data retention and (ii) finalizing
accounting issues so that each participant has a certification of how much
it is owed by each defaulting IOU.  The PX seems to have lost its "pass
through" nature, which is critical to each participant being able to asset
its claims directly.   I am particularly concerned that the committee,
through its professionals is beginning to have a life of its own.

It would be useful to have this discussion prior to the committee meeting
tomorrow afternoon.  Are you available after 10 a.m. central time tomorrow
to discuss?

I assume that you have handled this. If not, let me know what I (we) need to do.

Can you send them 2 months' rent and tell them the person from Enron who needs to sign the lease is out of the country? Or if you want , I will bring a check up to Sacramento on Wed to pay them. Let me know today as I am flying to SFO late today.

Mike,

I assume that you are in charge of the finalizing of the repository lease,
and that you will be in touch with the folks at the building regarding
status.  I am not sure how long we can go without sending them a check.

Let me know if you need my help.

Peter

If possible, don't sign a lease until I get back. If you need a immediate
answer, let me know.

I am pathetically and pathologically late in getting back to you.Sorry. Enron is very opposed to this. Can we talk at your convenience today.

You received a memo last week from Kaye, Scholer recommending that a demand for arbitration be made immediately with respect to Edison.  As I explained, part of it would be a preemptive strike on the assumption that Edison is preparing an action against the participants.  At this stage, the recommendation is only to commence the arbitration, not to file a suit seeking prejudgment remedy of attachment.  I anticipate that the issue will come up for a vote during this Thursday's committee meeting.  What is your position?  Bob

Attached is a copy of the Offer of Settlement that will be proposed by the
Official Committee of Participant Creditors in the chapter 11 case for the
California Power Exchange Corporation.

As FERC's July 25 Order requires Judge Birchman to make recommendations
regarding the amounts owed by each IOU to each Seller and to apply the
methodologies required to make these determinations, the Offer of Settlemen=
t
will have to be presented to Judge Birchman as part of the ongoing
proceedings, at the appropriate time.  In addition, the Offer of Settlement
will be presented to the bankruptcy court in CalPX's  chapter 11 case at or
about the same time it is presented to FERC.

We are forwarding the attached copy of the Offer of Settlement to you with
the understanding that it will not be distributed to any person or entity
other than the attorneys listed above and the appropriate business contacts
at their respective clients.  Our discussions regarding the Offer of
Settlement will be much more effective if we can prevent the Offer from
becoming generally available to the public, including to those who might
oppose the Offer, before it is actually filed.

Please review the attached copy of the Offer of Settlement and send me your
comments and suggestions.  We would like to have your support for the Offer=
.
Perhaps it would be most efficient for Ron Carroll to schedule a conference
call to discuss the Offer in more detail.  Please let me know.

Richard,

I spoke to Paul Heath and he said the bankruptcy code tolls the running of
limitations, so long as time to file had not run prior to the filing of the
bankruptcy petition.  The code provides for a new, two-year limitations
period from the time the petition in bankruptcy is filed.  From our
conversation, it sounds like that was filed on 9/4/99, and we will then
expect to see Ben's suit filed by 9/4/01.

The attached is my summary of what I perceived as the key bullet points from
Grella's testimony with some page references.  I hope it's useful.

Stacy,

We deducted the difference between Index and his fixed price hedge from hs last check.  He removed his meters 2 months prior to the expiration of his fixed price hedge.  He says he did not have a valid contract with ENA.  He was sent a Confirmation at the time of the deal.  He did not contact me about not having a contract until the prices were above his fixed price deal pricing.  Dan Hyvl agreed that the deduction should be made from the final payment to Adkins.  Dan should have all the info.

 I am on my way back from vacation today.  Call me on my cell phone @ 330-284-3871.

Here are:  1. a copy of the Confirmation and 2. the worksheet used to make the deductions.

 << File: Adkins Confirmation.doc >>      << File: F Adkins Final Payment.xls >> 

P.S.  He pulled the same stunt with Jim Javins  - EES, prior to moving his meters to CES.

Sounds Fine

We should waive this.  I waived a similar conflict for Guido last year. He represents us in the Stamp Tax case in Argentina and frequently represents the Bolivian govt. We'd rather have someone we know is a good lawyer and objective than someone we don't know.   FYI, Guido wrote the Supreme Decree that enabled Transredes to get its deferred account back.
Dear Michelle, 

The Superintendencia General del SIRESE (Bolivia) just send me the background of the Transredes case in which they are requesting my advise. 

It is an administrative appeal before said agency of resolutions SSDH Nbr. 0257/2000 and 0014/2001 concerning the assesment of a fine of 710.000 bolivianos due to an oil spill and the rejection of the appeal filed before the Hidrocarbons Agency.  

As mentioned in our conference call, I informed the Superintendencia General about my assistance to Enron in different matters and they expressed no concern about the independence of my advise nor potential conflicts of interest. Please be kind enough to confirm me that Enron acknowledges that no conflict of interest arises of my eventual assistance to the Superintendencia General cocerning this matter and, therefore, that it has no objection in order for me to provide such assistance.

Best regards,

I have revised and am emailing to you and Robin a copy of the revised Molla=
nd Declaration that I have sent back to Michael this afternoon wherein he e=
xplains what happened yesterday regarding the tentative ruling and asks for=
 oral argument. When I spoke to Michael late this afternoon about the decla=
ration I learned some additional information which is contrary to one of ou=
r assumptions, and suggests it will be harder to expect the court to go for=
ward with argument on Monday. Through this afternoon(when I had discussed t=
his separately with Richard and Robin today), we have been operating on the=
 assumption that only telephonic notice to opposing counsel of the intent t=
o argue was required to have oral argument in SFO court and that notice to =
the court itself was not required. If so, the court would have this one on =
its Monday calendar. I asked Michael again how the Court would know what ma=
tters would actually be on the oral argument calendar and was told today th=
at the telephonic instructions from the court which accompany the tentative=
 ruling tell you before listening to the recorded ruling  that apparently Y=
OU HAVE TO PUSH A CERTAIN TELEPHONE NUMBER BUTTON AT THE END OF THE ORAL RU=
LING IF THE MATTER IS TO REMAIN ON CALENDAR FOR ORAL ARGUMENT. That was not=
 done by the person who first called and listened to the ruling for Michael=
. When someone called back and attempted to do so the response was "invalid=
" or something to that effect. Presumably that was because it was sometime =
after the 4:30 deadline. This would suggest that we are not even on the cal=
endar (without a request for oral argument)as we had hoped. I still will be=
 there to argue, or at least argue for a hearing date. I wanted Bob to know=
 of this new info in case it affects his decision on coming out here. Call =
me on my cell 619-985-9792 any time if anyone has questions. I will be emai=
ling the draft replies for Sacramento tomorrow.

We did not learn of this tentative until after 4:30 today, although it was
probably posted sometime earlier in the afternoon.  The local rule states
that a party who wishes to argue the tentative shall notify opposing counsel
before 4:30. We called their attorneys after 4:30, but before 5 PM. I
reached Martin Goyette, counsel for the AG personally by phone shortly after
five, and notified him of our intention to argue. He claimed the AG would
not appear to argue given late notice. I have notified him by fax of our
intention to argue.

I have gotten the form to sign up and pay for 2001 playoff tickets.  All the
other participants have agreed to join in.  We will have some sort of
lottery to determine ticket usage.  Unused tickets will be credited to next
years season tickets.

I have a document by someone named Marty Howard, who I believe may be
associated with Portland General. The document was sent to me by Richard
Tabors. According to the email Howard used to work for McCullough.

After a very brief read through, I think it tries to show that the
statistical link between prices in CA and the PNW was WEAK in peak hours. I
suppose they are trying to show that the "contagion" effect from California
show not be an issue? I have some problems from an initial read with the
econometric analysis, but I have not yet reviewed it fully.

However, it also leaves open the very possibility that was discussed earlier
on the call. If there is a refund, and it is based on some notion of "PNW
prices", it could be a very large one. I think we need to consider this
issue quite carefully.

I am assuming that this is just an FYI. If so, dont respond back

Since this is an insurance claim, I am leaving it to Bob to handle (per Jim Derrick's policy manual).  As to the last sentence of your e-mail...have you been talking to my mother? 
ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION; PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Tom and Mike:

As you may know, NEPCO and the project Owners are named in a personal injury
lawsuit that was served on NEPCO earlier this month in Cook County,
Illinois.  I tender the case by letter to Dick Corp for their defense and
indemnity since it involved one their employees who broke his leg on the
jobsite in Kendall, Illinois.  I cited paragraph 4 (b) and (d) of the JVA as
my authority for shifting the risk to Dick, however was silent on Paragraph
11 and 19 which actually says we should have purchased a GL policy for the
JV to protect the JV and its partners.  As a cost saving measure agreed by
the JV partners, no policy was purchase because each Dick and NEPCO would
rely on the GL policy of their own (Dick's and Enron's) to protect
themselves against third party claims. Paragraph 19 is an indemnity which
states the JV partners share risk 50/50 without respect to who is at fault
except for willful actions.  It also states the JV will indemnify the JV
members, which only works if the JV had purchased a GL policy and in the
absence of a GL policy then the intent would be that each party will utilize
the others GL policy and share in the deductible cost.  Dick has responded
in writing and said it will defend and indemnity NEPCO through its GL policy
(Travelers) but says the JV partners must share in their $250,000
deductible, or $125K per partner.  That hurts, but not as bad as if this
were handled by Enron's policy which has a self insured deductible of $2
Million.

In the end, I agree to some extent with Dick's response for pure third party
claims, but I have some trouble with the concept of claims coming from their
own employees of which they would have immunity from suit under the workers
compensation act.  Dick pays up to it's cap on liability under the WC act
and then theoretically has 50% deductible liability under the GL policy for
claims against the other JV partner.  Had this not been a JV relationship,
we would have had Dick paying all of the defense and indemnity as a
subcontractor.  The JVA is silent on this split in liability for claims by
either parties' own employees, however, I look back to the paragraphs I
cited to Roger Peters (Par. 4 (b) and (d)) and they say with respect to
subcontracts, of which Dick and NEPCO were expected to perform their
respective scopes of work under (see 4 (b)), each such subcontract shall
oblige the subcontractor to indemnify the JV and each of the parties from
and against all expense, liability and claims resulting from its
construction/engineering work.  This language would say that Dick should
take 100% of the claim.  

The bottom line, the JVA is vague in respect to claims by its own employees.
If this were the only claim, I would say lets share the loss because the
benefit and exposure flows both ways.  In reality though, most if not all of
the claims will come from construction workers (Dick employees).  So sharing
the loss is not reasonable especially since the Travelers lawyer has said
the common practice of Union hired employees in the Chicago area is to bring
numerous accident injury claims against owners and GCs as the project winds
down.  He said to expect more claims like this because he sees this on other
Dick jobs.

Gail and Bob,  This message is more for informational purposes since the
claim has been accepted by Dick Corp although Travelers did not afford me
much selection of counsel since they went ahead and assigned it to a Chicago
lawyer, Chic Marasa.  His number and address is:  (312) 345-7229, Law
offices of Chic Marasa, One East Wacker Drive, Suite 3450, Chicago, Illinois
60601.  We may want to have one of you monitor the outside lawyer hired by
Travelers and make sure our interests are served.  I sent the complaint and
my tender letter to Richard Sanders on August 10th.  Gail,  I spoke to Chic
and he sounds nice, single and available if you are interested. Juuust
kidding.

Please let me have your recommendation re the possible extention of coverag=
e.  Thank you. Jim

Mr. Derrick, I am directing this email to your attention at the request of =
Mr. Jim Bouillion for consideration of extending coverage to Nepco, pursuan=
t to the EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT on our Directors & Offi=
cers policy.

We have reviewed the Petition wherein a former iron worker of Nepco alleges=
 damages as a result of being terminated, in violation of Title 85 O.S. d 5=
.  The Plaintiff sustained an on the job injury on April 6, 2001, when he w=
as struck by a crane.  He received workers compensation benefits.  He alleg=
edly re-injured his back on June 15, 2001.  The Plaintiff alleges that "sev=
eral hours after notifying his employer of re-injuring his back, Plaintiff =
was summarily terminated by Defendant."  The "Plaintiff alleges that a sign=
ificant part of Defendant's decision to terminate him was because of his in=
jury and because he exercised his rights under the Workers Compensation Act=
."  The Petition goes on to state that the Defendant's actions "were done i=
n reckless disregard for the rights of the Plaintiff and/or were wanton and=
 motivated by oppression, fraud and/or malice" and thus includes a count fo=
r punitive damages.  Suit is filed in Tulsa County, State of Oklahoma, with=
 an Answer date of before September 4, 2001.

Our preliminary review of the Petition, absent any independent investigatio=
n or knowledge with respect to the allegations and the value placed on same=
, suggests there might be coverage for this loss under the Directors & Offi=
cers policy.  The definition of "WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE" includes "th=
e actual or constructive termination of a career opportunity, or employment=
 discipline or evaluation in a manner which violates any local, state, or f=
ederal law, whether existing by statute or common law, or which breaches an=
y implied contract to continue employment"...It is doubtful this matter wou=
ld exceed the $1M policy deductible.

Please advise if you would like for us to extent coverage to Nepco.  Accord=
ing to the information provided, the matter has been assigned to Bonnie Whi=
te of the Litigation Unit and is being overseen by Richard Sanders of ENA.

Richard, I have had a request from Denise LaGesse (at Lou's request) to remove the Enron Litigation Unit charges on this matter from their operating company (ETS) and charge them to ENA instead.  We have billed ETS 5 times since January, the total amount of the billings being $4,678.47.  If you are in agreement with this transfer of charges, please provide the company # and cost center # that you would like me to have them transferred to.  I can forward details of these billings to you by fax or mail.  Let me know your preference.  Thank you.
 
Denise, I will need your company # and cost center # as well.

Sorry for the overreaction on Fri. I was having a very bad hair day. It see=
ms like no harm, no foul. I need you to keep your finger on the pulse on th=
is issue. I called Zach Starbird( Mirant) about the issue and he was surpri=
sed that Mirant had voted in favor. Can you call Brian Holman and see where=
 they stand. If you know any of the other attys well enough, please call th=
em and lobby them also.I am in South America this week, but would like to b=
e on the conf. call thurs. Can you make sure I have the #s.

With respect to the PX settlement, I am an unenthusiastic supporter. Please=
 let me know if the proposal changes.

Richard, sorry about the mix up.  The damage has been undone with a call to=
 Weg and Cohen changing our vote to a loud no.  I apologize.  I really don'=
t want to be out in front of the client, particularly in a case in which I =
myself cringe at the creative ways lawyers are coming up with to keep thems=
elves busy.  When I couldn't reach you before the committee conference, I c=
alled Lisa to ascertain whether she still was in the PX loop.  We talked ab=
out the committee call.  She actually participated for the first few minute=
s to express her view that our committee should not be filing in formal mot=
ion to expand the PG & E committee.  We briefly discussed the arbitration i=
ssue, and she did not appear adverse to commencement of the arbitration.  M=
aybe that wasn't formal clearance to vote.  Lesson learned.  I want to avoi=
d any such problem in the future.  Unless I hear otherwise from you, on sub=
stantive issues I won't vote until I clear positions with you personally.  =
However, we have to find a better way for me to get your take on particular=
 points because they will continue to arise as Weg and Cohen (not to mentio=
n other attorneys who participate on the committee) urge the committee to t=
ake actions in the interest of discharging our fiduciary duty.  Case in poi=
nt, the Weg settlement.  Have you decided whether to withdraw the approval =
you previously communicated.  If it would help the communication, I'm perfe=
ctly willing to talk with you evenings or weekends.  Then again, you wife m=
ight react like mine if her privacy at home is interrupted.  In any event, =
assuming that Enron wants to stay on the committee, probably a good idea ju=
st to reign in the lawyers, let me know how we can most effectively communi=
cate so that I know your position and can convey it when you are not availa=
ble for a call.  Incidentally, with you impending trip, feel free to call m=
e over the weekend at 626-683-7644 if you want to discuss this further.  Bo=

Richard & Lisa:  I understand from Carl that there is a call with some of the generators tomorrow to discuss the foregoing.  In that respect, I am forwarding a brief memo that we prepared a number of months ago (prior to PG&E's filing) regarding some of the issues/considerations that potentially would arise if Enron Wind were to file an involuntary petition against SCE.  The memo is a bit "dated" but I nonetheless thought it might be helpful to you to some extent in terms of setting forth some of the relevant considerations that arise in the involuntary context.  Please let me know if you would like any follow up on any of this prior to the call.  Thanks  John

What is this about? I am here all week.

Our attys are at Lebouef, Lamb in New York. I cannot get them by e-mail or phone.. We probably need to postpone.
I think the time for the call is actually 9:30 central, not eastern.  I
just tried to dial in, etc.  Talk with everyone at 9:30 central.

Lets talk at 9:30, if only to reschedule

This is clearly a crisis of international proportion.  We will obviously
defer to the moment.

At the risk of sounding irreverent, however, timing in California remains
critical.  We would very much like to have Enron on board in the event we
file an involuntary petition today or early tomorrow.

That is probably our lawsuit. Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) is an Enron LLC with Calpers-- the California State pension fund. Lets take a look.

FYI.  I'll keep you informed of our efforts to find the suit, assuming one has been filed.

No.  We don't have computer access to the Midland State Court, but our investigator was trying to work with the Clerk to assess captions of recently filed cases.  
 
We went back through the Harris County filing reports, and Ben Hall did file, a couple weeks ago, a case in the 281st styled "Costilla Energy v. Joint Energy Developers"... I've instructed our investigator to get a copy of the pleading, but it didn't sound like the suit we were anticipating.  

Did you find anything in Galveston, Midland or elsewhere indicating that there was a lawsuit filed? 

I heard that Enron's buildings are being evacuated.  In view of the chaos, I am assuming we will not be meeting this afternoon.  Call me if that's not right.

Fyi. I told her not to go because we had too many other problems. I do need to develope a plan to deal with FCPA. I would like to mninmize her involvement, but fear this will upset Derrick and Walls. Any suggestions?

Soojin, it appears we will need to postpone the training.  While this is not related to yesterday's events, I am in the middle of a major crisis involving one of our projects in Brazil and have been asked not to come to Korea until it is resolved.  I will be sending the materials, the presentation and the new policy by email and will contact Mr. Kinder about rescheduling.  I know there was some urgency in having this training before the end of September, and perhaps you can forward the materials and power point on to those who were to attend for their review in the meantime.

I apologize for the delay in responding, but I hoped we could get this resolved in time for my trip to Korea, but unfortunately some things are beyond our control.  I appreciate your diligence in trying to make these arrangements for me.

Regards,
        Michelle

Stephanie,

Any news?  In light of  tragic events that took place yesterday in the United States, We would like to confirm Michelle's flight itinerary.  We are in urge to arrange this training if it is scheuled for early next week as planned.  Please advise soonest.

Thanks,
Soojin    

Will await for your resonse.  Thank you again.

Soojin

Michelle just recently returned from Brazil (after a three week stay) and had all day meetings on Thursday and Friday.  She has not had a chance to review all of her emails.  Having said that, Michelle and I will respond as soon as possible.  I am not privy to the information you are requesting.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Stephanie,

I have sent a mesage attention to MS. Blaine last week and haven't got any response yet.  I am wondering if you can help us to find out the informations that I requested to her in the below message (Training Agenda, materials etc...).
We need to have more informations prior to her arrival in Seoul so that we will be able to coordinate the presentation for whole staffs including our subsidiary company employees.

Thanks for your collaboration.

Thanks,
Soojin

Ms. Blaine,

Greetings from Korea!

I am Soojin Hwang and assistant to Darrell Kinder of SK-Enron in Seoul, Korea.  I have heard that you are planning to come to Korea on Sep. 17 to conduct FCPA training.  Would you please give me some more details on training (Duration, who has to attend?, equipments (laser projects etc), training materials?) so that I will be able coordinate with legal person in SK-Enron prior to your arrival.

Thank you,
Soojin

Anthony,  I just spoke with Michelle Blaine's assistant.  Michelle is planning to be in Korea the week of September 17th and would like to conduct the training sometime during that Monday to Thursday.  I will let you know when the date is confirmed.
 
Also, are you having a regional meeting in Singapore this fall?  I thought it might be a good chance for Michelle to present the FCPA training to the whole group.  The presentation takes one hour.  We are making an effort to provide the training to EBS before year-end, so it would be great to have the Asia region trained as well.  
 
Please let me know what you think.  Thank you, Michelle   

Can't make it. That is my son's third birthday. Maybe I should bring him and the rest of my family(and inlaws) and try to pass it off as a joint celebration.

In order to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Duke/Citrus matter, we are planning on hosting a very nice dinner at the Houstonian (surprise, surprise) for the fine legal talent -- both in-house and out-house -- involved in this matter.  You along with a spouse/significant other are invited.  How does Tuesday, October 2 look?  I would like to do it sooner, but Mr. Manne has informed me that, due to his busy social calendar, he is not available before then.  We will plan on beginning at around 7 p.m. Please let me know if you can attend.

No, I agree we should file on Monday. I would suggest that we reschedule the conf. call for friday am--7o'clock.

My instructions from Kevin Heffron who is the commercial lead overseeing this matter is to file the answer and counterclaim within the normal time limit, without seeking any time extension.  The intention is to signal beyond doubt that we mean business - and Kevin is concerned that seeking an extension, however usual, will give the opposite message.  Our target should therefore be to file this week and I suggest that we stick to the original schedule.
 
Thanks for your help
 
Paul   
I have left a message for Richard to this effect, but wanted to make sure that everyone was in the loop.  Due to the incidents in the US yesterday our offices in Chicago were evacuated.  That has thrown off our schedule slightly for distributing the answer and counterclaim.  We plan on having a draft to everyone by 12:00 noon tomorrow.  I am also going to contact opposingc ounsel to let see if they would be agreeable to an extension of time to answer.  (I will wait until we discuss the matter to specify a definite time period for an extension).  In all likelihood, we can obtain an extension from opposing counsel (and/or the Court) if that is necessary in light of the events. 
 
In light of this revised schedule, we may want to reschedule the conference call currently set for 7 am central time tomorrow.  That is up to you.
 
Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any questions or concerns about the revised schedule and for what time you would like to have the conference call.

I spoke to Rick McCombs at Mayer Brown this morning and he informed me that he is in trial all week and unavailable for a call today. We agreed to a 7am central (1pm London and 8am New York) call on Thurs. to go over the answer and any other pending items. He promised a draft answer by  3 pm central on Wed afternoon.H opefully, Paul will be well by then. I will set up a call-in number for the conference..
 
I am trying to set up a conf. call today at 10:30 central to speak to the Chicago attys. Andy is not involved in this case. 
 
Mark, fyi
Paul J is away sick but asked me to deal with this.  I have also discussed with Paul S.  Conference call planned for 2pm today with Andy Edison to discuss this (and Kemper).
 
Let's keep the pressure up by all means but I understand that an extension of this period is not hard to come by. 
 
I assume you're talking about that with Andy, Paul J.

Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.

 We should file on Monday, absent some compelling reason.Let's postpone the conf.call until Friday---same time. I need the draft answer by 2 pm central on Thurs. I cannot have a Thurs afternoon call. Is Rick McCombs available on Fri am?

For purposes of clarification, our answer and counterclaim are due on Monday, September 17.  That should not present any problem as far as we are concerned.  My point in raising the extension issue is merely to let everyone know that, since our schedule at MBP is sliding slightly, an extension is an available option if needed.  However, I see no problem in getting the answer filed by Monday.  (It should also be noted that court here was closed yesterday and today.  This may effect when filings will be due as well.  We are looking into the matter).
Please let me know if you have any questions.

My instructions from Kevin Heffron who is the commercial lead overseeing 
this matter is to file the answer and counterclaim within the normal 
time limit, without seeking any time extension.  The intention is to 
signal beyond doubt that we mean business - and Kevin is concerned that 
seeking an extension, however usual, will give the opposite message. 
Our target should therefore be to file this week and I suggest that we 
stick to the original schedule.

Thanks for the update. Is the hearing still on?

per your request, this e-mail will update you on the scultes lawsuit in cleveland.

you received, and we discussed, the replies we filed in support of the
half-dozen motions to dismiss and/or strike (and a sanctions motion) filed by the enron defendants.  replies were also filed by the mcdonald and sdi defendants in support of their respective motions to dismiss and/or strike, copies of which you should have received.  their briefs are more complicated than ours, but so are their facts.  an oral hearing on these motions is currently scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on September 10th.  The court has ordered no discovery until at least these motions are heard.

if you need any further detail, or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Tell Bethany that I am sorry I miss the Country Day Alumni function last Fri. I told her I would be there, but other more pressing matters prevailed----at least I think so--- the days are blurring together. I probably did one of two things--- got drunk( there has been alot of that around here lately), or went home, got in bed, and pulled the covers up over my head.

The good news is that the 4th beer usually makes the pain/depression/anger go away. The bad news is that last week it was the 3rd beer.

Richard here is what I have--there is an update in progress, but nothing substantive for your purposes.  You have the ESA risk matrix which has the major cases you may want to reveal.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.  I have my cell phone 713-899-6300, or Stephanie has the number to this conference room.  Do you have any good news?  John Gardiner is here from NYC and keeps reminding me "we are all still standing."

 << File: South America Report.doc >> 

Fyi. It looks like Jim is becoming more informed if not more involved.
Jim, here is a good update on where we stand with a possible filing to protect a retroactive suspension of direct access.  Please call me with any questions.

As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers.

Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing.
We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case.
To the extent we have customers on our filings, we have a much better shot at winning. I have gotten agreements form a number of other ESPs who will join with us.  They are: APSES, Strategic Energy, AES/New Energy, American Utility Network, and perhaps Commonwealth. Each of these, in turn, is working to get some of their customers to sign on. I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join.
Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date.
If you have customers intersted in signing on, please let me know.  The customer may contact me or the attorneys directly.  Here is contact info:

I just wanted to let you know that the trophies and  pictures and evaluation forms are ready to be picked up. Just come to the front  office and let them know what you are picking up. They are all clearly marked.  Please encourage parents to fill out the evaluation form and your equipment to  the game on November 10th and give it to the official.
 
 
Thank you,

Have we implemented a policy?

I have additional names from Jay Webb's organization charts.  We may need to protect their e-mail files (in addition to the list we gave Andy last week.)  Can you give me 5 minutes to discuss?

Also, should I proceed with gathering files from Louise Kitchen and others?  

I have been reluctant to stir that pot until I knew how you wanted me to proceed.

Thanks...

 

Attached are the questions relating to LJM listed in the order of importance from a timing perspective.  I am available at any time to discuss. You can reach me in my office or cell 713-569-2798.  Regards,   Julia 

	 

 

thx

Richard-
 
Good luck on your company's adventure.  I  can't think of a better person to direct Enron's defense.  You will be  happy to know we turned down an untruthful proxy statement,  1933, and 1934 act  case.  (Actually, you probably wish a nit-wit like me got the  cases.)

The Horror, the Horror

Now that the Astros have hired Williams, they'll be my favorite NL
team.  I would love for the Astros to do well just to make Dan Duquette
look stupid.

And in the World Series good triumphs over evil.

I would give you the second half of the old "I have some good news and
some bad news for you" but given your employer, that would just be
piling on.

-Vance

As you will note from the papers, we are in deep shit. As you would guess, Haedicke is in charge.Call him.

I know you are really busy. Is there any way I can get 30 minutes of
your time to meet with Hugh Ray and me?  We really have something to
offer you guys. We'll come to your place anytime

The press is bad because it is accurate. I have never seen more greed, arrogance, and lack of morality.

this week.  The press is really bad on this.  I know that it could not be
much fun at work these days.  That with the mold and apartment
dwelling....this has not been your year.

Hope the kids and Julie are well.  Give them my love.

If we go to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, we probably can't meet you. Julie is waivering on Las Vegas though. I'll call.

Very sad.

Hey, yall really need a break from Houston.  Any chance you want to meet us
at the Perd next weekend.  I would do all the grocery shopping.....to make it
easy for you and Julie to get the kids out of town.  We have not seen you
forever....and I have not been to the Perd since July.

I transferred the bunk beds out there, but they still need to be put together
and in a room.

It would be the 16 and 17

I am going to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, but am available any day but Monday next week. Let me know your schedule.

Are you available for lunch next week?

Will

I talked to Jempy about this last night.He don't want another meeting. We have a new canidate in the hard-ass client category.
I am unclear as to why we are taking this approach.  This discussion is nothing but a rehash of past conversations that we have had with DP.  There are no new developments to discuss.  They have threatened us and, in my opinion, are simply trying to extort advantages from us to which they are not entitled.  My suggestion is that we initiate the arbitration process and put them on the defensive.  We don't owe them any explanations because we are acting within the bounds of the agreement.  I would like to remind you that their behavior during these last several months can be called into question.  I think violations of confidentiality on their part should be discussed relating to the "offers" them claim to know about.  They solicited a key employee of AMPS concomitant with accusing us of violating our fiduciary responsibilities.  
 
If they feel passionately that we have behaved inappropriately, then they should move forward and avail themselves of their remedies.  Otherwise, we shouldn't waste our time or dignify their baseless allegations with yet another inane conversation.  Why do we always have to negotiate with the "terrorists" when we have the moral high ground?

[Neyman, Jesse] 
    I was able to speak with Victoria Westerhaus today about her September (sic) 27, 2001 letter. Victoria said that before she would be prepared to discuss the substance of her letter she would need to speak with Tom and Wayne.  She did; however, mention that neither she nor her client understood why Enron had been so anxious to dissolve the company when her client had several potential buyers very interested in the company. She mentioned that if Enron didn't want to put any more money into AMPS, it should have worked with DP to find a buyer.
    I told Ms. Westerhaus that it was my understanding that a bona fide buyer was not lurking on the horizon and that there was no way that the company could have continued operating. She said that AMPS could have suspended operations instead of dissolving.  She then inquired as to whether the company had, in fact, been dissolved.  In response to that question, I told her that my last meeting about AMPS had been over a week a ago and I had no additional information. I then suggested a conference call between Enron, its counsel and DC and its counsel to try to bridge the parties difference's before the towels wee thrown I n.  She said she'd get with Tom and Wayne and get back to me.
    Please let me know what your schedules look like for the rest of the week.  I will call the Bracewell folks and see how theirs look.  Thanks.

Good. Lets talk that morning.

I am open that week.  How about Tuesday?

I am going to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, but am available any day but Monday next week. Let me know your schedule.

Are you available for lunch next week?

Will

Two issues: First,should we pay the law firms? Total is 43mm. Second, Lisa and I think that the group needs some direction today. Can we have a 10-15min telephone call at 4:45 or after the Board meeting (6:00)

How about we give her some Enron stock options.

First of all, it sounds like the Perd clean-up is good for everyone except
John.  So it is a go.

As for the Sanders' children Christmas...noone really came back with many
suggestions....so we still don't know what we are doing.  Although all of our
kids want for nothing.....it was still nice to say to my kids...that your
uncles did this for you. I don't have any ideas that I am trying to
sell....just trying to coordinate the effort.

A thought I do have is to have each family adopt a room and redo/refresh its
appearance.  Mom would like to see some of the rooms repainted...and this
could all be coordinated together....just a little redo would be a nice
touch.

However, that being said...I am still looking for ideas.

The last thing on my list is Mom.  She turns 70 in 13 days.  She is taking
three friends to the Perd...Betty, Jane and Lucy to play bridge.  Steve and
my family are headed for a short visit with them on Saturday the 15th.  Is
anyone planning a gift for her.  Does anyone have a suggestion.

OK, I won't bug you again.....

Hey Richard- 
Hope you, Julie and the boys are doing well. 
I need your address to send a Christmas card.  If you could send it I would appreciate it. 
Thanks- 
Jane Ellen

If you get this, drop what you are doing and give me a call at the office.

I can't begin to tell you how much I would like to do that---except for one thing. I will be dead or mortally wounded when I tell my wife. She moved the entire family to a new house on Monday with no help from me.Thanks, but no thanks. I've got some making up to do.

	How about a round Sunday around noon at HCC?  All work and no
play makes us dull boys.  Let me know.

yes

where are you?

Should I go ahead and make hotel and car reservations for California? I'd be happy to.

fine

Hi everyone,
We would like to know if the Perd. is available at Christmastime? We would
like to go down with some of Susan's family.

Can we talk about this today?

	How do we handle something like this?  In my old world, it used to be that a litigation manager at corporate would have to be involved in something like this pretty much regardless of whether the local guy thought it was under control or not.  Is that the case still? Should I tell Dave to send the file?

This is a heads up to a mounting dispute with a major equipment supplier,
Foster Wheeler Limited (HRSG supplier).  Currently they have initiated an
arbitration action before the AAA here in Seattle for a payment claim ($1.2
M) on the Linden, NJ project of which we have held back payment to satisfy
our claim for delay LDs and re-work ($3.8 M).  While this action is pending,
FWL has initiated some unlawful bargaining tactics on our Lakeworth, FL
project.  More of the drama is outlined below.  

No need for action here.

ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION; PRIVELEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Galen,

I don't have the full history of dealing on this purchase order with FWL,
but my instincts say we don't have to accept "material" changes to the terms
on the eve of signing a PO.  FWL's attempt to adjust significant delay risk
at the eleventh hour constitutes a breach of good faith and fair dealing.
It is as if we were to sign the PO based on weeks of review of a firm and
final price but mark down the price a few million on the final draft because
we felt we were taken to the cleaners on a previous job they sold to us.
FWL needs to be instructed to accept the PO without the proposed changes.
If they refuse, we have (and we must tell them) the choice to contract with
another party and hold them liable for the extra cost of another supplier to
make the schedule required.  This liability is based on breach of an implied
contract and FWL faces damages for detrimental reliance (that would be the
incremental cost above FWL's firm price charged by the replacement vendor).
The reliance argument is that we excused other bidders weeks ago and chose
to exclusively deal with FWL based on agreement (reliance) of terms and
conditions presented in earlier drafts of the PO or referred to in previous
PO documents.  The detriment argument is FWL knew they had us captive to
them on this deal.  By going forward without other bidders, we lost price
protection and commitment for schedule by other bidders, therefore we are at
a detriment without market forces.  In the best world, our purchasing
activities need to keep proposals competitive by not dropping back to one
supplier for critical path equipment.

I mentioned a choice here, the other choice is to continue to deal with FWL
and accept their additional terms because the risk of changing horses and
being successful on a lawsuit based on implied contract and detrimental
reliance outweighs the risk and cost of having to "mitigate" the effect of
LDs on FWL if critical path work is not impacted or hard to document and
prove it was impacted, and whether our obligations were fulfilled in this
respect.  Since FWL has now opened the door to change "material" terms on
the eve of signing, we have the opportunity to do the same with them, but
that doesn't help if the parties continue to go in opposite directions while
your end date stays the same.  I would say they know this is a dilemma to us
and are betting we will deal with them on these new first-time "material"
changes to the PO terms.  If we go with the second choice, I would encourage
NEPCO and Enron to take FWL off any preferred bidders list. 

In addition, I thought I heard from the folks who attended the Linden 6
settlement meeting a week ago that the parties said they would not let the
litigation on Linden 6 effect our other on-going deals.  Apparently FWL is
taking their issues on Linden 6 over to other deals.  We may want to do the
same.

Stepping back a bit, unless our documents and witnesses are crystal clear on
the implied contract theory and we have a clear fact pattern for detrimental
reliance, I wouldn't lick our chops and be confident that we got them on
this liability.  I am willing to advance an argument for posture purposes in
order to force some conclusion on the PO terms that they have attempted to
open up.  And with what little I know thus far, I would encourage we try to
strike a deal in lieu of another lawsuit.

		I am forwarding an email from Mr. Garry Greatrix, Project
Manager, Foster Wheeler Ltd.  Please read the document attached entitled
8&13.doc.  This has been presented as revised language to "all NEPCO
contracts" from Foster Wheeler.  This suggested language has been presented
as endorsed by Foster Wheeler legal and executive management.  The FW team
explained that this language resulted from what they have experienced with
NEPCO on recent projects, specifically Linden 6 and Kendall and that they
cannot sign the purchase contract without it.

		Since this affects more than the Lake Worth Project I felt
any acceptance or dialog regarding FW's suggested language would need to be
reviewed and approved by NEPCO legal and executive team.

Sorry about the conference call this morning--- I neglected to get a call in number. I talked to Paul Simon, who had talked to Limor Nissan, and among the lawyers, we have no more comments. Paul was going to get together with the commercial team and see if they had any issues. Paul will contact you today with these changes/additions. If they are not substantive, I don't need to see them. Send Limor, Paul, and me a copy of the filed pleading. Thanks for your help.
Paul: 
We will get you a draft by the end of the day on Wednesday.  You are correct that our answer (or other pleading) is due on Monday, September 17.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success 
assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is 
depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our 
bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation 
which McCook have forced on us. 
  
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for 
comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day 
period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my 
calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent 
to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation

Looks good

Camille,

Based on your message below, I believe it advisable to issue a formal notice to Newtown responding to their cancellation notice and reaffirming our legal position on the enforceablility of the Transaction.  I have revised the letter that I prepared for you Friday and would appreciate your review and comment.  Please call me with any questions or comments regarding the attached.

Steve, 

Thank you for the legal interpretation.  After our conference call today with you and Newtown Paper dismissing the idea that this is a force majeure claim, 
we held our position to keep this deal on the books.

Thanks

YOU ARE ONE ANAL DUDE

	Richard,

	I am doing this so I won't forget.  This will confirm that I will pick you up for work Wednesday morning.  I will be by your house between 7:00-7:15 (it depends on when Sue Ellen gets back from her jogging, which I don't do anymore because of my alleged heel problem).  I have an out-of-the-office meeting Wednesday evening, and I go to it directly from work at 5:30, so I won't be able to give you a ride home on Wednesday.

	Later.

	Britt

Huh? For you to handle as you wish.

Richard,

Please help on this issue.  Kindly respond to Roz Carpanese at GSP immediately, the entire balance of this counterparty is past due.

This is pathetic but I don't know the status of this. What is going on? Did we send the letter?

Richard,

I'm wanting to send out the attached demand letter later today or tomorrow, after credit and the deal makers have had a chance to corroborate the facts.  Would you please review and get back to me with any concerns over issuing this demand.  The transaction involves as sale of old corrugated cardboard to a Chinese paper mill who has a sales office in California.  The Confirm was issued under the old Pulp & Paper General Terms and Conditions that do not contain an Arbitration Clause.

Thanks

Aparna,

Please review the attached for factual accuracy and forward to anyone you believe should comment.  Also, please note that we should include copies of the invoices that total the US$292,522.77 with the Demand Letter.  Will you please obtain them from accounting.  Please call with any questions.

   per your request, this e-mail will update you on the scultes lawsuit in
   cleveland.

   you received, and we discussed, the replies we filed in support of the
   half-dozen motions to dismiss and/or strike (and a sanctions motion)
   filed by the enron defendants.  replies were also filed by the mcdonald
   and sdi defendants in support of their respective motions to dismiss
   and/or strike, copies of which you should have received.  their briefs
   are more complicated than ours, but so are their facts.  an oral hearing
   on these motions is currently scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on September 10th.
   The court has ordered no discovery until at least these motions are
   heard.

I may be too late on this but here goes---- if arbitration is out then agree to a forum that is not in their backyard.

Pat, thanks (and congratulations) for pushing the remaining issues with Lodi through to completion.

To the trading lawyers and Richard:  As I have discussed with Christian and Steve, Lodi continues to insist upon removal of the binding arbitration provision.  We have fought hard on this, but the city attorney is steadfast:  He wants to be able to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether to arbitrate or litigate a particular dispute.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP IF YOU OBJECT TO THE DELETION OF THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS (the agreement will just be silent as to whether the parties can use litigation or arbitration).  Otherwise, we will shortly be executing the master trading agreement, which is needed for a particular trade we are negotiating with the city, as well as for general trading purposes, which Christian and Steve have been handling.

It's worth pointing out that the city attorney made very few proposed changes to this complex agreement.  I thought that was a little strange.  Also, we won the battle to keep TX law for the Enron corp. guaranty.

Thank you,

Kenton

  

The issue of the SCE bankruptcy will come up again. Carl-- did you ever talk to Reliant or Mirant? The next call that you have re the PG&E bankruptcy, I would like  to join in and dicuss the issue of an involuntary filing. I know we have talked about it before, but because of the hijackers, we never got the full legal analysis. Tom Laria at White and Case and the McCutchen attys had done some research. They offered to provide it to us. Lets take a look, do our own research, and discuss.

Richard & Lisa:  I understand from Carl that there is a call with some of the generators tomorrow to discuss the foregoing.  In that respect, I am forwarding a brief memo that we prepared a number of months ago (prior to PG&E's filing) regarding some of the issues/considerations that potentially would arise if Enron Wind were to file an involuntary petition against SCE.  The memo is a bit "dated" but I nonetheless thought it might be helpful to you to some extent in terms of setting forth some of the relevant considerations that arise in the involuntary context.  Please let me know if you would like any follow up on any of this prior to the call.  Thanks  John

   RESENT AS OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.  I WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED WITH THE
   CALL ON
   A BRIEF BASIS TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY INTEREST IN A MEETING WITH SCE OR A
   CONFERENCE CALL WITH SCE's COUNSEL. THE CONFERENCE CALL SHOULD LAST LESS
   THAN 30 MINUTES.  IF NEED BE, WE CAN RECONVENE LATER TODAY.

   We have set a call to discuss SCE for this Monday.  The agenda will be
   similar to the agenda of the 12th, except that the California
   Legislature is
   set to adjourn this Friday evening, so we should know what ensured.  As
   it
   has been our intent to be as inclusive as possible, if there are other
   creditors that you wish to invite, please do so.

This will confirm that I would like to have an organizational meeting at 2 pm central on Tuesday the 18th---one hour. Twanda will provide a call in #.

The criminal attorney has a prior appointment and won't be able to make our 11:00 AM Houston time call.  Guido would like to know if there is any chance it could take place at some other time.

Regards,

Andrea

By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Twanda to set up a short conf.call w/yo=
u on Wed or Thurs to discuss these issues
In today's call we addressed the usual issues.  This Friday the complex lit=
igation panel will decide whether to consolidate the commandeering suits.  =
In case you hadn't noticed, the state filed a declaratory relief action in =
Sacramento naming each of the individual participants but not the PX.  The =
state's alleged fear is that it might be exposed to double recovery to the =
PX and the individual participants, so it asks for a declaration of its exp=
osure to the participants.  The new complaint has not yet been served.  Our=
 counsel who are trying to keep matters simple are considering strategies t=
hat will avoid the need for each participant to respond, and we should have=
 some recommendation next week.  Next, Howard Weg will circulate a draft mo=
tion to FERC submitting his proposed settlement.  We should have the draft =
within the next week.  Next, a subcommittee met with PG&E reps last week to=
 get a preview of a possible reorganization plan.  Weg may call Michael Tri=
bolet to get his take on plan structure.  Next, the state Senate evidently =
balked at the Edison bailout.  Reliant and Marant have not filed a petition=
 and are considering their options in view of the possibility that the gove=
rnor will call the legislature back into special session in early October. =
 In the meantime, Edison is producing documents in response to the 2004 not=
ice.  Weg raised a question about whether Enron will be filing an administr=
ative claim in the PG&E case pursuant to court order in that case.  I wasn'=
t aware of the issue.  Are you?  There were productive plan discussions wit=
h PX representatives as to structure and tasks of the PX going forward, and=
 we are expecting a proposal momentarily.  Discussions with the Trade Credi=
tors Committee still haven't reached closure.  PX reps evidently will be ap=
proaching PG&E and Edison to share the cost of future operations.  Our next=
 committee call is Sept. 26 at 2.  We still need to talk about the funding =
issue when you have a moment.  Bob

I am not in a huge hurry. I just want to make sure we have fully reviewed our options now that we have a little more time. LLGM should participate on this call and gather all other information available(Mirant and Reliant legal memos) and lets talk sometime next week. I think LLGM is in a better position than Enron to dictate timing, so I'll leave the scheduling to you.

Richard:  ironically, I received this e-mail from my bankruptcy partner Ben Young a minute or so after receiving your note regarding SCE/involuntary filing.  Is this a call that you want to be on?  Also, do you want to try to talk with Carl/Ben tomorrow on the SCE situation?  Do you want us to take a quick look at the information from Mirant et al before we speak?  Perhaps you could reply to this e-mail or give me or Carl a call and let us know what your schedule may look like.  Thanks  John

I participated in the conference call that Phil Warden put together regarding SCE.  The call was brief, lasting about 20 minutes.  Reliant suggested that an approach be made to SCE's lawyers to ask them what their plans are in light of the apparent failure of the MOU.  The parties on the line agreed to this suggestion, and this Wednesday, 9/19 at 9:30 was tentatively set for a call with SCE's counsel.  Phil will confirm the call and circulate the dialin information.

Dear Richard, 

As requested, please find hereinbelow the different sections of Law No. 25,188 of Public Ethics (PEL) and of our criminal code (CC) that could be in play in this matter.

Please notice that we have recently discovered through our criminal lawyer the unpublished opinion of the Anticorruption Office dlivered at the enquiry of the Secretary of Communications. Some of the ideas therein expressed could benefit Mr. X in case than a specific investigation or challenge is made. We will work in a memo to illustrate on the matter.

Section 13, PEL: It is incompatible with public office: 

a) to manage, administer, represent, sponsor, provide any advise, or, by any other means, render services to any person that negotiates or has a concession or is a supplier of the State or performs activities regulated by the same, so long as the relevant public office position has a direct competence with respect to the engagement, achievement, negotiation or control of such concessions, benefits or activities;

b) to be a supplier, either on its behalf or on behalf of a third party, of any State body where the relevant person is an officer.

Section 15, PEL: If at the moment of his appointment, the public officer is held to be within any of the incompatibilities mentioned in Section 13, he must:

a) resign to such activities as a condition precedent to assuming the position. 

b) refrain himself from intervening, during the performance of his duties as an officer, in matters related to the persons with whom or issues in which he were connected with for the past three (3) years or where he has a corporate participation.

In such circumstances, those acts could be considered null and void and generate the responsibility mentioned in section 17 of the abovementioned law that provides:

Section 17, PEL: Notwithstanding the rights of any third party acting in good faith, in the event that the acts performed by the persons comprised in Section 1 are within the scope of Sections 13, 14 and 15, the same shall be absolutely invalid and void. In case of the issuance of an administrative act, such acts shall be absolutely invalid and void pursuant to the terms of Section 14 of law No. 19,549.

The concession companies or other counter parties shall be severally liable for any damages caused to the State by these acts.

Section 173, CC: 

Fraudulent administration 

Notwithstanding the general provision of the above-mentioned Section, the following shall be considered special cases of fraud and shall be subject to the penalties established therein[prison of one month to six years]: 

...7) who, due to any applicable law, authority or legal act, is in charge of the management, administration or care of assets or economic interests belonging to a third party, with the purpose of seeking on its behalf or on behalf of a third party an illegal profit or of causing damage, infringes the duty of care, damaging the entrusted interests or illegitimately forces the owner of the same;...

Section 256, CC: 

Passive Corruption 

The public officer who, on its behalf or through any third party, receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and perpetual disqualification to hold a public position.

Section 256 (bis), CC: 

Influence peddling 

Who, on its behalf or through any third party, asks for or receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to illegally influence a public officer so as to make the latter act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position..

Section 258, CC: 

Active Corruption 

Who, direct or indirectly, grants or offers benefits seeking any of the behaviours referred in  articles 256 and 256 (bis), first paragraph, shall be punished with prison from one to six years. If the grant was made or offered to obtain any of the referred behaviours by articles 256 bis, second paragraph and 257, the punishment will be of prison from two to six years. If it was a public officer, he will be punished with special disqualification from two to six years in the first case and from three to ten years in the second one.

Sounds like a good plan. Andrea-- I have asked my asst. to get with you to reschedule. M. Haedicke wanted the criminal atty on the call.

Where do we stand on Guido's compensation for his most recent activity. It appears he holds a strong interest in this matter but I think it is best to cap his efforts on our behalf before we get a substantial bill for multiple political outcome analysis.

Richard I would suggest Andy call Guido and define where we are cost wise and define the box as of today.

MFG 

I tried to call you, but the phones are out. No urgency, I just remember your proximity to the WTC and wanted to make sure you and the members of your firm are OK.

Yes. I will do so.

Should we talk to Fergus about an adjustment to the bill from Michael Molland owing to the confusion, consternation, and erosion of confidence in the lawyers his ignorance of the local rules caused here last week? 

I am ok

Can you guys get back to me today.  Kirby has offered to the produce these (with my ok--i did not think it would be controversial).

I have no objection if Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs are ok with the proposal.  Jim

The AG subpoena requests copies of organization charts for EES and Enron Wholesale's trading group.  The time period specified is October 1, 1999 to the present.  These may exist as slides used in presentations to the Enron Corp. Board.  Mike Kirby wants to offer them to the AG as a show of good faith to the judge.  Is it okay to disclose these?

P.S.  Rebecca, since our discussion, I clarified that organization charts for only EES and EWS trading are covered by the subpoena. 

As you will recall, Steve was referred to us by Neal Manne and served as local counsel in the Glatzer matter. He has done a great job. Although I don't have anything now, I would love to send something his way.

Richard:  Thanks for thinking of us.  I was at ground zero, saw the
whole thing, and escaped in the nick of time.  There are obviously a lot
of emotional consequences, but I'll give you the basics.  On Wednesday,
we learned, incorrectly, that our building had collapsed or was about
to.  At that point, we all decided we might never return and that our
mission was to obtain new space and to resume our operations as soon as
possible.  Last Thursday, we took new space at 45 Rockefeller Plaza and
ordered all new computer systems.  Friday we got hold of the computers
and over the weekend they were installed.  By Monday, we were had phones
and computers and we were up and running.  Now we just need to get our
documents out of 1 Liberty and we are not sure when that will happen.
We had a tremendous amount of help and offers of assistance all of which
we greatly appreciate.  My information appears below. My fax is

I just talked to our accounting dept and told them about your proposal to f=
ix the mistake. They are ok with it. Just make sure you document it as desc=
ribed in this e-mail.

P.S. There is no bigger matter to deal with than your bill. This  must be t=
he kind of half--truths that made you the most hated man in Sacramento.

My accounting department advises me that back on April 27,2001,  Enron appa=
rently sent us a check for $54,585.11, which we received and deposited on M=
ay 7. The check  included the payment of $28,087.71 for this firm (the exac=
t amount of our February billing) and mistakenly included payment of $26,49=
7.40 for one of Ed Kee's (PA Consulting Group) bills. That check was receiv=
ed after we sent our March billing and is thus not reflected on that bill. =
The full amount of that check showed up as a May 7 payment to us from Enron=
 on our April billing, and reduced the outstanding balance by that amount. =
Whereas the total balance due shown on the April statement sent to Enron wa=
s $44,772.92, if the overpayment had not been made , the true balance due w=
ould have been $26,497.40 higher. Given the delay in sending our bills, and=
 the accumulation of additional time, there was never a credit balance on a=
 billing to Enron, but the total balances due always included credit for th=
e prior overpayment. We are about to send out our July billing today and ou=
r accounting department(Annmarie Robertson) got a call from Martha at Enron=
(345-4088) who realized what happened and asked for a refund check. We can =
and will obviously do that , but then we have to immediately ask Enron for =
that same amount-$26,497.40- because our prior bills would have been underp=
aid by that same amount. I am told that we cannot easily(if at all) go back=
 and have the computer generate previous months' bills now with an unpaid b=
alance when they were previously paid. My accounting department says it wou=
ld be easier to just send out  the July billing with a cover letter confirm=
ing that the $26,497.40 erroneously paid to us on May 7 has been credited i=
n full  to Enron, and is fully reflected in the total balance due. Hopefull=
y this makes sense and I know we both have bigger matters to deal with.  Ca=
n you approve us doing this or send us an email if Enron needs to get a che=
ck and revised billings. Thanks. .

JOINT DEFENSE

I spoke today with Sweetwater's counsel, Rob Hanna of Best, Best & Krieger.
Two items to report:

=091.   Judge Sammartino.  Hanna alerted me to an article in the recent
San Diego Lawyer  (see attached).  The article concerns the "M (for
Motherhood) Group," a group of 10 San Diego women lawyers that have met
twice a week for the past 21 years.  Judge Sammartino is a member of the
group, as are two lawyers in Hanna's firm - Arelene Prater and Tina Dyer.
Hanna said he wanted defendants to be aware the relationship between the BB=
K
lawyers and Sammartino.  Hanna said he has no plans to challenge Judge
Sammartino, but wanted defense lawyers to be alerted to the issue.  Unless
someone has a different suggestion, let's factor this into the mix when we
revisit the coordination issues next week.

=092.  Case Management Hearing.  Hanna reported that his office had
contacted Judge Hayes' clerk to ask whether the CMC hearing (set for 9/28 i=
n
Sweetwater) would be going forward. Hanna's office was told the CMC would
remain on calendar.  Hanna and I jointly called Judge Hayes' Court Clerk,
David Lim, to follow up.  Mr. Lim confirmed that, notwithstanding the
assignment order to Judge Sammartino,  Judge Hayes wants the parties to
provide a status report at the CMC.  He confirmed that the Court wants the
parties to file CMC questionnaires, although he suggested that the Court is
probably most interested in the coordination status.  The CMC questionnaire
is due Friday, Sept. 21 (although Mr. Lim said we could filed anytime prior
to Thursday noon (Sept 27).  Given that Judge Hayes appreciates strict
compliance with the local rules, I suggest we file this Friday.   We will
prepare a proposed joint CMC statement for all defendants and circulate the
same tomorrow.

I think I mentioned this before to you. Dave Noonan and I jointly own a 3 bedroom condo in Park City, Utah. If you and your wife, with or without kids, want to get away for a break(and remain beyond the California borders), you are welcome to use it. It sits vacant most of the time.

 Thanks. I'll take the third week of February. By the way-- if you call the house during that week and someone tells you they rented it from me for $5000 per day, that's my brother and no matter what he says, that's only an inside joke in our family.

Sounds good

Andy Edison tells me we are considering using John Quinn in case EBS files an arbitration versus Qwest.  Also, we may need California counsel to file some suits for EES against some customers for breach of contract.  The amount of these claims range from $150,000 to $2 million.  I was going to propose using Shaun Morgan and Kristen Bird, who did outstanding jobs on the UC/CSU case, to handle these.

Hi Jim--

I am glad you got the book.  I thought reading it might help you go to sleep.  Seriously, it is a terrific piece of work.  I am sure Mark will find it helpful.

I understand that it has been finally determined the unfair competition\antitrust suits against Ernon are now is state court in California.   You have invested a lot of money educating us about your business. If there is anything we can do to help you, Robin and his team, we would be delighted to pitch in any way we can.

If you and Karrin ever make it out here, Mary and I would love to get together again.

have passed it on to Mark Holworth of our legal department, who often
deals with these issues for Enron.  I hope all is well with you and

Thanks for the check. The entire Sanders family is going next weekend for a "work weekend." It woild be great if you could go, even for a short time. No one is bringing kids, although Ben is old enough to help. Call me if you want details. 713-853-5587.

Call me on my cell phone 713-410-6128. I am ready to go.

I am traveling with my brother to Picton on Feb 22. Do you have a room w/ 2 beds for the night of the 22nd?

I would like to book a room w/ 2 beds for Thurs the 21st. I have inquired on the NZ bed and breakfast website but cannot get to the reservation desk. My Visa # is 4388 5490 0061 6748 exp 11/03. Can you confirm a reservation?

All joking aside, we would love to use it. Maybe next summer. By the way, although I have not invited you and Dave to come to Portland on the 3rd, you are welcome. I am not sure it is the best use of your time. I am flying to SF to meet w/ Gary on the day of the 3rd to catch up on FERC issues You may want to come to that.

In your firm's name

I assume you got this. Do you want the repository in Enron's name or in my firm's name? It might be advisable not to have Enron as the named tenant in Sacramento. I do not have a problem having the firm or myself as the tenant. I am already subject to jurisdiction here.

Dear Richard, 
As requested, please find hereinbelow the different sections of Law No. 25,188 of Public Ethics (PEL) and of our criminal code (CC) that could be in play in this matter.
Please notice that we have recently discovered through our criminal lawyer the unpublished opinion of the Anticorruption Office dlivered at the enquiry of the Secretary of Communications. Some of the ideas therein expressed could benefit Mr. X in case than a specific investigation or challenge is made. We will work in a memo to illustrate on the matter.
Section 13, PEL: It is incompatible with public office: 
a) to manage, administer, represent, sponsor, provide any advise, or, by any other means, render services to any person that negotiates or has a concession or is a supplier of the State or performs activities regulated by the same, so long as the relevant public office position has a direct competence with respect to the engagement, achievement, negotiation or control of such concessions, benefits or activities;
b) to be a supplier, either on its behalf or on behalf of a third party, of any State body where the relevant person is an officer.
Section 15, PEL: If at the moment of his appointment, the public officer is held to be within any of the incompatibilities mentioned in Section 13, he must:
a) resign to such activities as a condition precedent to assuming the position. 
b) refrain himself from intervening, during the performance of his duties as an officer, in matters related to the persons with whom or issues in which he were connected with for the past three (3) years or where he has a corporate participation.
In such circumstances, those acts could be considered null and void and generate the responsibility mentioned in section 17 of the abovementioned law that provides:
Section 17, PEL: Notwithstanding the rights of any third party acting in good faith, in the event that the acts performed by the persons comprised in Section 1 are within the scope of Sections 13, 14 and 15, the same shall be absolutely invalid and void. In case of the issuance of an administrative act, such acts shall be absolutely invalid and void pursuant to the terms of Section 14 of law No. 19,549.
The concession companies or other counter parties shall be severally liable for any damages caused to the State by these acts.
Section 173, CC: 
Fraudulent administration 
Notwithstanding the general provision of the above-mentioned Section, the following shall be considered special cases of fraud and shall be subject to the penalties established therein[prison of one month to six years]: 
...7) who, due to any applicable law, authority or legal act, is in charge of the management, administration or care of assets or economic interests belonging to a third party, with the purpose of seeking on its behalf or on behalf of a third party an illegal profit or of causing damage, infringes the duty of care, damaging the entrusted interests or illegitimately forces the owner of the same;...
Section 256, CC: 
Passive Corruption 
The public officer who, on its behalf or through any third party, receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and perpetual disqualification to hold a public position.
Section 256 (bis), CC: 
Influence peddling 
Who, on its behalf or through any third party, asks for or receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to illegally influence a public officer so as to make the latter act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position..
Section 258, CC: 
Active Corruption 
Who, direct or indirectly, grants or offers benefits seeking any of the behaviours referred in  articles 256 and 256 (bis), first paragraph, shall be punished with prison from one to six years. If the grant was made or offered to obtain any of the referred behaviours by articles 256 bis, second paragraph and 257, the punishment will be of prison from two to six years. If it was a public officer, he will be punished with special disqualification from two to six years in the first case and from three to ten years in the second one.
Section 258 (bis), CC: 
Influence peddling 
Who grants or offers to a public officer of another State, direct or indirectly, any  value or other benefits as donations, favours, promises or advantages, in order to illegally influence him so as to make, as exchange, the latter act or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office related to any transaction of economic or commercial nature, shall be punished with confinement from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position.
Section 268 (3), CC: 
Affidavit Omission or Falsification 
Who, under law and in view of its position, is required to file a patrimonial affidavit and maliciously omits to do so, shall be punished with prison from fifteen days to two years and perpetual disqualification.
The violation shall be deemed such when, upon sufficient notification demanding compliance, the relevant person fails to comply with the requested obligations within the terms foreseen by applicable laws.
The same penalty shall be applicable to anyone who maliciously falsifies or omits to include in the referred affidavits any data or information that is required to be included in accordance with any applicable law and regulations.

I have done it but not until this morning. You may want to call him. Also-Novack and Williams have not completed reviews.

Call Guidry. Bruce is probably relieved he doesn't have to complete another form. I also left you a VM on the propsed McCartney trip. I need you to coordinate through Stephanie so we can get the dates set in stone.

I haven't completed any of mine.  Our understanding down here is that we got an extension.  Do you mean call Guidry or Lundstrom?  Do I need to do something on line?

I would have David interface with the Costilla D&O insurer. I would call Jim Studdert re Enron coverage.

	Is there an insurer to whom we ought to forward the Zapata and/or Harris county suits? In the alternative, should I send a copy to David Brown at VE? 

Yes-- deal with Willie directly. As for the claim of 1.825 million, as long as ENA accounting agrees to that #, I am fine. Is that just ENA or does EES also have a claim?
Hello!

It was nice to see you at the POS event last week.  I can't believe that
we're into a new school year. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch; we did a
fair amount of traveling this summer and now I'm over my head preparing for
a trial that begins mid-October.

I assume/hope that you did receive a payment from the PCA trustee on
account of EPMI's allowed claim.  If you didn't, shame on me for not
following up.  If you need me to, please just let me know.

The only other open matter I have for ENA is in the Perry Gas case in which
ENA filed a proof of claim in the amount of about $1,918,000.  A plan of
liquidation has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the anticipated
(not guaranteed) payout over time is expected to be in the 55-60% range.
The post-confirmation trustee is in the process of reconciling claims.

From the email below sent to my from the post-liquidation trustee's counsel
(who was also counsel to Perry Gas during the bankruptcy case), it appears
that the trustee's accounting people have been talking to Willie Stewart in
accounting at ENA to try to reconcile the slightly different numbers.

From what I understand, Willie Stewart and Perry agree that, with the
exception of $78,337.16 that ENA owed Perry  for August 1999 deliveries,
the amount of the prepetition claim is $1,903,490.72.   Provided that there
is no disagreement about the amount of unpaid sales from Perry to ENA for
August 1999, the $78,337.16 should be offset against the $1,903,490.72
claim, which would leave ENA with a prepetition claim of $1,825,153.56.

I would be happy to deal directly with Willie on this if you'd like -- just
let me know.  If Willie agrees with the $78,337.16 amount due to Perry for
August 1999, do I have authority to agree to the prepetition claim of
$1,825,153.56?  Perry has made one distribution and I'll get the commitment
up front that as soon as the agreed order allowing ENA's claim, Perry will
cut a check for the first distribution.

If my case settles, I'll give you a call to set up a lunch.  I'd like to
get caught up.  Thanks and take care.
Thanks,

I am flying in on the morning of the 3rd, arriving at approx. 9:30. I will be leaving for Portland at 5:30. That should give us from 10:30 to 3:30.

Richard- I definitely want to attend the FERC briefing with you and Gary Fergus in San Francisco. Is it on Oct 2 or 3? At what time? I have advised Dave Noonan about it and he will go if he isn't in New York. Are you going from San Francisco to Portland on the evening of the 3rd? Let me know. Thanks

I would like to talk to your partner. Can you give me the info.

Richard:  One of my litigation partners mentioned to me the other day that he had seen that Enron recently had been sued by Bid/Ask LLC in the Eastern District of Texas. I assume that this type of case would fall under your "jurisdiction."  (Just what you need, another lawsuit!).

Apparently, this caught my partner's attention because he recently had been considered as litigation counsel by another company that had been sued by Bid/Ask for infringement of Bid/Ask's patent and, in that respect, had done a considerable amount of diligence on Bid/Ask's patent and its patent application history. (This lawyer is a patent litigator).  He surmised that the lawsuit against Enron might be somewhat along the same lines; however, I don't know whether or not this is the case or not.

Since the action was brought in Texas, I assume that you are (or will be) using one of your Texas outside counsels to assist you.  Nonetheless, I thought I would just mention this prior diligence to you on the off hand chance that it could be of some assistance to you or your outside counsel, at least in terms of getting a download of any information that we may be able to impart in the event the case is very similar to this previous one.

I hope that you are doing well (or as well as can be expected with everything you have going on).  Congratulations on the resolution of the CA Senate investigation proceeding.  Let me know if you want to follow up at all on this.  If I don't talk to you before then, hopefully we can catch up for a few minutes at the ENA Legal Conference in two weeks.

Diana,
Here is the message that Kate sent to Diane, and the original messages from Diane are below that. I think we will have this sorted out going forward.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Bill

Diane -

I'd like to clarify the type of information Real Time needs in order to fulfill positions for the short term desks. 	As we're all sadly aware, PGE has become increasingly frustrated with our confusion regarding delivery points when we do lending and parking deals with them, so it is imperative that any information included in an e-mail to Real Time corroborates with data entered into Enpower. Following are the discrepancies I see between Enpower and the information given to Real Time:
 
1. On Sunday, according to Enpower, STNW is long on peak @ PGE System. The deal number that would be relevant to Real Time in this case would be the purchase (855033, not 855032). That way we can link our real time sales to the day-ahead purchase in Deal Scheduling. Also, Diana confirmed that this length should be sold off @ Mid-Columbia, not PGE System, which is not what is shown in Enpower. 

2. On Monday, according to Enpower, STNW is short 53 mw on peak @ Mid-Columbia. The relevant deal number here would be 855044 - again, we only need to know the deal number that corresponds with your position. Also, since anything that alludes to the wrong hours, delivery point, or deal number only serves to confuse the traders on shift, I was thinking it might work better if we sat down and went over these positions together before sending anything out to the group. (This is what I do with Holden when STSW does lending or parking deals.)

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or any suggestions about how to make this work more smoothly.

Thanks,
Kate 

Forgot the light load on Monday and deal numbers - 
The deal number is 855032.1 for Sunday the 4th 7-22 Heavy Load  Hours only.  

The deal numbers for the 53 MWH on light load for Monday is 854942.1/855044.1 - please supply at PGE System.
For November 4th, Midc HL hours 7-22 only, we are 50 long, please supply at PGE system.

 Happy Halloween ! Be safe!

During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we=
 are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil=
d out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concern=
s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu=
cing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these conc=
erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu=
res without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to tal=
k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing=
 certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college re=
cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire. =
 We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple=
 of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p=
resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading=
 schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass=
 and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are unc=
ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon=
g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north=
west.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo=
st schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have a=
lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  =
The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit =
that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa=
rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it=
 is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our be=
lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=
 of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to empha=
size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will i=
nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba=
sed on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider t=
he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e=
mployees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we=
 don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro=
n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread=
y here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor=
e certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we =
still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo=
r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o=
n this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela=
ying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final arch=
itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo=
re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives th=
e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move=
.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=
 sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n=
ow.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje=
ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=
 right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w=
ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o=
r delay again. =20

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel=
iable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard=
 time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep=
 up the success of this office.

Hi, Here is my schedule to be home in Nov.
11/5 - 11/9 and 11/26 - 11/30.

The rest of the time I'll be gone somewhere. If your schedule says to come some other time during the month, I'll make sure there will be someone here.
Let me know what your plans are.

Hey Monica!

Long time no hear!  Just wanted to make sure you and Kristian are doing fine.  Morale here is extremely low.  I'm sure its the same there.  But we continue to be busy.  Good thing for all of us!  When are you guys coming back to the states?  By the way, how are your parents?  I hope they are safe and well.  Keep in touch!

Diana,

Would you be available to help me with the Assoc / Analyst recruiting this week?  We are going to Portland State this week.  

Here's how it works:  There is an Info Session on Thursday at 5:00 PM and interviews on Friday.  The Info Session is from 5:00 PM  --> 6:30.  There is a PowerPoint presentation which explains Enron's business  which depending upon how many questions, usually takes from an hour to an hour and a half.

Then, Friday morning, we are only interviewing in the morning from 8:00 AM to 12:00 Noon.  The interviews are 1/2 hour each.  You should be back to the office before Noon. 

Would your schedule allow you to help me out?

Thanks

O.K.!  Just to keep you appraised of what I'm doing,  I have left a message with Bob Sullivan @ CISO and I spoke to WAPA.  I think the call to WAPA was just to notify them that they won't be managing Shasta's transmission position for the term of our deal.  I'm going to be working with Bob Sullivan to create procedures for scheduling purposes.  Not sure if you want to stay in the loop for that?  You can update Gerry though, for me.  I appreciate your help!

Thanks

Diana

Diana,

Great work.  Is there anything you need me to do?

If everything is in place, I will contact Gerry Cupp at Shasta letting him know.  Or, if he needs to do something, I will get that started.

Thanks,

Vicky,

I went into Scheduling to view these deals and they have been zeroed out.  I'm confused as to why they would appear in the view actuals in deal entry.  I believe these should synchronize, or they read off of one another. ??

diana

Deal # 517673.1 and 517674.1

HI Diana and Sean:

Would you advise whether I can ask scheduling to zero out volumes for NCPA buy/resale deals for 10/1/01-10/3/01 in "View Actual" tab in deal entry?  

Thanks,
Fran

Hi Diana and Sean:

I believe we didn't buy/resell with NCPA for 10/1/01-10/3/01.  Although we are good in scheduling (no activities scheduled) there are some volumes showing up in deal entry side ("view actuals" tab).  In order to make sure that at month end settlement processes will be smooth for these NCPA buy/resale deals, I would like to ask the scheduling group to zero out those volumes for 10/1/01-10/3/01 in view actuals in deal entry, but I need you to give me the green light first.  Your confirmation will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Hey what's the scoop on this?

diana

What is this project?  Who is the sponsor in the west?

Per our discussion yesterday, these are the people we have identified who will parallel test the consolidated position manager, after an initial limited production release, against results from whatever tools they are using in production today...

EAST		WEST

Smith Day	Kysa Alport
Corry Bentley	Kate Symes

Only the East guys have participated in early testing in our test environment.  Generally, it is much easier for everyone to test against production data once the app is migrated.  The data in test is pretty ugly.  Since CPM is new and does not update anything, we have no problem moving to prod for further testing once the app is stable.

Glad to discuss...

Steve

FYI.....
I have to tell you more than you want to know to preface this response. 
There are 5 hydro projects in the Mid-Columbia region. These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term "take away rights", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a "single bus" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.

Each participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.

The "single bus" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB.

"For transactions that occur at only one bus (i.e. no OASIS/GF transmission 
involved) use a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the 
first line and the words "Single Bus" in the OASIS reservation field and 
"7-F" as the Product." 

Is this practice not being practiced?  I've seen/heard that at the MID 
Columbia folks selling energy to those who have take away rights at MID C 
are have their tags denied because the tag creators are not using a "TP 
specific transmission path or designation".  It was agreed to use "Single 
Bus" in these situations to avoid the implications of transmission service 
where no transmission service was necessary from the MID C. 

If the sink control area is bringing the energy back to their system at that 
point then the sink should have it indicated that it's not a single bus for 
their transmission portion, but may be "GF" or "No reservation required" 
from the bus to the system.  But in this circumstance then the path is not 
MIDC-MIDC but MIDC-SYS.  That's my take.  Others wish to pipe in?

Stewart, 
 
I left you an envelope with information regarding the City of K. Falls. Not sure if you forwarded it to anyone to begin the process for credit approval.  Can you please respond to Ray's E-mail?  Let me know if there is something else you need me to do.

Hey Diana- 

What's up with getting credit with the City of Klamath Falls?  I didn't hear back from you the other day.  It sure would be nice to get that in place.  Is there someone there I need to talk to?

thanks, 

Ray Grinberg 

 
 

We match with $424.80 owing to PGE for the month of December 01

ds

Hi Diana

Here is our detail for December 2001.  There are only real power losses and it's only from 12/4 to 12/7.  This should be an easy one to match.

Anne

Steve Hall is contacting Al Paske regarding the transmission contract.  Apparently they have already been discussing this issue.  

ds

 
Have you been able to come up with any information about this transmission?----cgy

I don't.  I will pull our contract with BPA and give you a decent reply!

d

Diana, 
The message below is a routine notification message from our contracts administrator in Houston.  Do you know which agreements she is referrring to and whether or not we need to renew them?  ----cgy

I show that both of the transmission agreements that we had with Bonneville expired 9/31/01.  Do we need to execute firm and non-firm service agreements with them?  I'm copying Jan b/c I'm not sure you are back in town.

We are short at PGE system for Wednesday, 10/17/01.  HE1-6, 23-24pdt, we are 13mw short (total of 104mw).  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  Deal #821995.1

Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk

Hey Young!

Perfect timing I tell you, Natalie came down with the croup.  Hence I'm staying here to take care of her cuz Dad's out of town also.  Real bummer because there's a lot of fun going to happen up there!  Have a good time!  Maybe we can go hiking around here!

Diana

Hi!

I'm thinking  about going for a hike, around the lake, Thursday afternoon.
The area supposed to be very pretty.  Do you already have a plan? 

Young

9/23	Bill C. fixed this day and we check

9/24	To MPC-EPMI Colstrip s/b priced with the .10 cent adder peak & off peak
	To EPMI MC Memo {800 mw @ 18.40} s/b priced with the 1.50 parking/lending adder
	* OK for the hard part!  our nets are ok for the balance of the problem but they aren't priced correctly.
	We have a 101 peak plus a 25 peaker (15-20) totaling 1766 mwh's that s/b priced @ 20.55
	Then we parked/lended for a total of 590 mwh that s/b priced @ 21.95.  
	You have them dispursed between several accounts:	 To BPA-EPMI (PGE sys)= 497 mw
								 To PGE CA EPMI Sale = 1459 @ 20.55 & 400 @ 21.55

Purchases= $ 156,755.00
Sales= $ 147,439.00

9/25	I BELIEVE OUR INDICES ARE OFF- I SHOW 18.98 PEAK & 16.60 OFF PEAK????  Every account you have on this day is off. Or maybe I have the wrong index!

	

		 	

Hi Amy!

So glad to have you back!  I talked to Grace this morning and she said it was ups'd yesterday.  I submitted it last week, so I'm not sure why the delay.  Please let me know if you don't receive it today.  Talk to you soon!

I've seen this one before, but it's always funny...

BEER
I have not seen anyone explain this as well as Cliff Clavin, on Cheers.  The
Buffalo Theory as told by Cliff Clavin: One afternoon at Cheers, Cliff
Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory to his buddy Norm, and here's how
it went: "Well ya see, Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only
move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the
slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural
selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and
health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the
weakest members.  "In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as
fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know,
kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain
cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker
brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine." That's
why you always feel smarter after a few beers

On the trading side we are doing several things.  First, we are trying to h=
onor as many of our physical delivery obligations as possible.  Several cus=
tomers have stopped making deliveries to us which is making it impossible f=
or us, in turn, to honor all of our physical deliveries.  In these circumst=
ances we are constantly updating our customers on the status of their sched=
ules so that they can make alternative arraingements.  The Cash Trading, Sc=
heduling, Services, and Real Time groups are doing an unbelievable job with=
 this.  I am impressed at how capable, professional, and calm our team has =
remained.  On the Term Trading side we are working with our customers to cl=
ose out positions.  This process is going very smoothly as well.  We traded=
 a record volume yesterday as our customers reduced their exposure to us.  =
The Term trading team has done an excellent job with this.  Third, on the M=
iddle Market and Origination side we are trying to work with customers to b=
ring cash in the door.  Many customers owe us money due to out of the money=
 future positions.  Many customers would prefer to settle up with us now ra=
ther than in bankruptcy if that is what ends up happening to us.  We have b=
rought a significant amount of cash in the door as a result of these effort=
s and saved our customers from going through a potentially onerous bankrupt=
cy proceeding.  I am very appreciative of the efforts of our Origination an=
d Middle Marketing team that has made this happen.

On the bright side, I remain optimistic that someone will buy or fund the N=
orth America gas and power businesses.  While it is impossible to handicap =
anything these days with Enron I am seeing some very positive signs on this=
 front.  Unlike the Dynegy deal, which required Dynegy to purchase the very=
 profitable core business along along with the rest of Enron's baggage, the=
 deals being considered now would likely involve only the core business.  I=
 don't know whether these deals happen, and if they do, I don't know what f=
orm the core business takes as a result.  Chris Calger and I have been part=
 of the team talking to our potential suitors.  We will both be in Houston =
through the weekend and into early next week working on this.  We will upda=
te people as soon as possible as things unfold.

I know that this situation really sucks.  Given the anxiety and uncertainty=
 that we are all feeling people are doing a great job keeping focused and s=
taying positive.  I think that things are going to unfold very quickly from=
 here -- most likely in the next week or two.  Please hang in there.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

I talked to Arvina this morning and she noticed that she has calculated the loss return using the wrong indicies.  She will be fixing that this morning.  I am attaching a summary of the loss return calculation and a quick summary of checking I did against Arvina spreadsheet.  There is a deal that we entered in differently, but the net result is the same.

Houston has requested we sit down with them on the phone and go over all the in-the-money contracts we have.  By their count we have about 50.  They want to account for each and understand why we may not be delivering on them.

Ed Baughman will be sending his master list in advance of a 11:30 call in Mt. Bachelor.  Please send at least one representative from each of the regional desks to discuss the list.

Thanks,

Sales to PGE:

10/3	After you put in the lending for this day, I agree we are still out by 150 mw.  Its down to two schedules; can you check to see what you show for the Montana buy/resale.  This should be 32 peak everyday.  The other for the day is our pge system to grizzly this should be 26 mw peak.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/5 & 10/6   You show 200 more llh....I don't know why????

10/8	The 200 mw you show llh should be a total of 256 (32 llh due to colstrip).  Call me to go thru the hourly at your system to find our 2 mw descrepancy.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/9  You show 8 mw @ 24.20 under To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC account.  Don't know what that is?  You also only show it on one side??

I'll send more when i get thru it!!

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

Michael,

I had a family emergency that I had to attend to prior to the holidays.  So I apologize, I haven't been in town.  Not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect, but hopefully we can reschedule.  Considering my situation now with my family, I will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon, but rather something either in Portland or within the West.  If Exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind, then please set some time aside to discuss.  You can continue to reach me either at home (360-834-3579) or at work (503-464-3807).  I no longer have a cell phone available at this time.  Thank you for your time.  Hope your holidays were good.

Regards,

Diana Scholtes

Diana,

Trying to reach you - should we arrange conversation tomorrow with Exelon or
pull the plug they have called us 3 times to coordinate- please give me some
feedback.

Hello John!  I appreciate the recommendation, but I am not in the position right now to make a move.  If they are interested in discussing a position here in the NW, I would be more interested in that.  I hope everything is going well for you.  

Keep in touch!

Diana

Diana; last week my boss and I met with Sean regarding a position within
PG&E similar to what you're currently doing.  PG&E would be very interested
talking to you but the catch is the job is located in Bethesda Maryland.
Are you at all interested, and secondly would you and Sean consider residing
in Bethesda performing the exact same function you are both performing
today?  The second option is a long shot but I wanted to run it by you.
Hopefully you had a pleasant Holiday.   John

Can you tell me what day was the last to be rolled in Auto Scheduler?  I'm trying to go back into December to balance Enpower for Settlement purposes.  

Thank you,

Diana Scholtes
503-464-3807

What we are looking at is cleaning up for December.  So the schedule strips have already been created.  For settlement purposes, we have to go in and clean house.  So it wouldn't help to change the deal in Deal Entry and  I'm not even sure that we can do it anyway because of deal preservation.  So we are looking at a time strip for example Dec 8-31 to zero out "Counter party".  

I will be talking to John tomorrow morning to find out more about the West Bankruptcy book.  Don't know anything about it.

Thanks again,

Diana

Good Afternoon Diana,

Did I capture your question correctly?

The users want to update the chapter11.exe program, that was developed to 'zero-out' schedule strip volumes for a given counterparty for a given day, to allow the users to zero-out the volume for a range of days?

IT Questions
1.  Schedule strips only get created for deals 2 days before day of flow.  So, based on the current design, the date range, at least looking forward, would only be a couple of days.
- Option 1:  Maybe, instead of zeroing out schedules, we should adjust the dates on the deal.  This would prevent schedule strips from even being created after a certain date?

2.  Working with John Postlethwaite & Stacey White, Will Smith has a program that converts deals from the real Enron books to a newly created West Bankruptcy book.  Will this work for you guys?

Anyway, just give me a call when you get a chance.

Thanks,  David Poston

September detail.  

Diana-

  We seem to be off on both Purchases and Sales for November '01 for Modesto.  I'm thinking it may have to do with the $26 deal....(?)

  Can you look over these numbers and tell me if you agree with Modesto.  Given everything that has happened lately, I'm not sure who is correct.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

  

Gwen,

Please confirm my November 2001 numbers.  I show that MID purchased 26,800 MWh's at $2,089,704.00 from Enron and MID had sales to Enron of 23,520 MWh's at $2,225,962.36.  If you agree with my numbers, I will net invoice Enron for 3,280 MWh's for $136,258.36.

I am hoping one of you can help me.  I am trying to send aninvoice out to City of Shasta Lake, but there is a deal we don't show in view actuals,or CARP, etc. so it's not part of the numbers I have to invoice then on - but they say they owe it to us.  It is the transmission capacity deal #839722.1 for City of Shasta Lake.  They see they owe us for this deal in the amount of $36,600.  Stewart, I had faxed you the confirm on #659898.1. It was a Laird Dyer deal and you were going to see if you could find out how we would settle it.  I am not sure if the two deals are related, but maybe they are?  Could the two of you look into these and let me know.  I need to invoice them with deal #839722.1, and I also need to know if we need to do anything for deal #659898.1.  Let me know.

Thanks - Amy

3/17	Remember this is the day that should look exactly like the 16th purchases (ours).  

3/18	On our sales to you....the MPC-EPMI Colstrip you have it priced @ $370.  This should be @ $343.85...
	Total = $489,535.44

Thanks! Seen this one?

Understanding Enron

FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.

FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk.

PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

APPLIED COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.

MEXICAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you into the army.

EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply. If there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows. They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain. They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.

CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Enron, according to Dr. Seuss...

They exercised and sold, exercised and sold.
And told all the employees to hold.
While they made billions, they continued to say
Our company will be the greatest someday.

But lo and behold it would not come to pass.
It was all a fraud and scam most would call crass.
"How could it be true?" we all asked.
"All we do is buy and sell gas".

But to make their personal billions
They had to keep in the dark their minions.
So they lied and cheated, stole and cajoled
Analysts, investors, workers and sold and sold.

But they found out the scam
And put the company in quite a stew.
They told Ken and Andy "we have lost confidence".
Little did they know, that confidence is what cons do.

The old man in charge said "we all trust Andy, he's fine,
He made me my fortune and never charged a dime!"
Andy got paid to manage illegal partnerships you see,
And for that he collected thirty m! illion as his fee.

But the pressure was on, and Ken had to act.
He told Andy, "You must go on leave"
Is he still on the payroll we asked?
We get no answer. Seems Andy will be there to the last.

Ken restated his books, and oh the looks that
Were on the faces of all but the crooks.
The books had been cooked! Not one year, not two, not even three,
They had been cooked a total of four.
And many suspect even more!..

He went into the elevator, that old gas trader.
He hit floor fifty, where his offices reside.
With two armed guards standing at his side.

And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith
And went into the boardroom forthwith.
There were the ghosts of Fastow, and Skilling.
Where with their cronies they devised great scams.
How to deceive, cheat, and steal millions of clams.

And with one more scam to do
He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck.
"Chuck", he said, " I'm in quite a jam, can! you please
help me I got caught in my scam".
So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side,
First with some money and took Ken as his bride.

But that old scoundrel had played too many scams
This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides
Went over Ken's books and found such a surprise.

There were no trades, there were no counterparties.
There were no assets, there was no Christmas party.
And so Chuck went to Ken and said "Your company
Is a sham. It was all lies. I cannot merge with you.
Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies!

And so Ken thought. He thought and he thought.
He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot.
Four thousand to be exact.
We thought he has lost gazillions,
but prior filing he managed to bonus
his friends fifty eight Million.

And so we are told, the company will be back.
A shell of itself but not quite the same.
The shell is appropriate as we all know,
The core business of Ken is a shell game.

Enron, according to Dr. Seuss...

And told all the employees to hold.

But the pressure was on, and Ken had to act.
He told Andy, "You must go on leave"
Is he still on the payroll we asked?
We get no answer. Seems Andy will be there to the last.

Ken restated his books, and oh the looks that
Were on the faces of all but the crooks.
The books had been cooked! Not one year, not two, not even three,
They had been cooked a total of four.
And many suspect even more!..

He went into the elevator, that old gas trader.
He hit floor fifty, where his offices reside.
With two armed guards standing at his side.

And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith
And went into the boardroom forthwith.
There were the ghosts of Fastow, and Skilling.
Where with their cronies they devised great scams.
How to deceive, cheat, and steal millions of clams.

And with one more scam to do
He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck.
"Chuck", he said, " I'm in quite a jam, can! you please
help me I got caught in my scam".
So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side,
First with some money and took Ken as his bride.

But that old scoundrel had played too many scams
This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides
Went over Ken's books and found such a surprise.

There were no trades, there were no counterparties.
There were no assets, there was no Christmas party.
And so Chuck went to Ken and said "Your company
Is a sham. It was all lies. I cannot merge with you.
Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies!

And so Ken thought. He thought and he thought.
He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot.
Four thousand to be exact.
We thought he has lost gazillions,
but prior filing he managed to bonus
his friends fifty eight Million.

And so we are told, the company will be back.
A shell of itself but not quite the same.
The shell is appropriate as we all know,
The core business of Ken is a shell game.

i think this is some kind of hint.  please help

Dear Portland Friends,
 
I am sorry I did not have to opportunity to say good-bye in person, so I am sending this message instead.  I am hoping that this message reaches all of you.  
 
It has been my privilege to have been able to work with and represent you in the various western region forums that were of interest to Enron.  I want to wish all of you the best for the future and if any group of individuals can make a new Enron work again it would be you.  I have learned a lot in my brief tenure at Enron and it has been especially satisfying working with professionals like each of you.  Hopefully sometime in the future our paths will cross again.
 
Happy Holidays to you and your families.  Also, if someone could also pass along this message to Cara S. in scheduling it would be much appreciated. (I cannot remember how to spell her last name...sorry Cara!)
 
Kindest Regards,
 
Dave

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

ms. freeland,

I don't know who will be updating this information for the estate, but someone needs to.  

ds

Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/Company_Information.doc

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

For additional information on these and other critical Etagging issues, please visit OATI's Etag 1.7 Information Page at http://www.oatiinc.com/etag17.

Deal # 614339.1 in the LTCA book has been changed from a fixed price of $158 to $155.  This is due to us not facilitating and paying for the CDWR In-Area sleeve.  

Diana
In discussion with Bob Floyd with CDWR and Mike Brommer from TID, Enron will continue its obligations to TID with a delivery @ NP-15.  CDWR and TID have entered into the $3 In-Area facilitation between themselves.  If you have any further questions, please call me at 503-464-3807.

Diana,

I represent a firm which has specialized in energy and power market
placement for over ten years.  I'm currently working with several
organizations across the country looking for energy traders, coordinators,
analysts and schedulers.  These are great opportunities to change location
or better ones position quickly.  I'd like to schedule a ten minute
telephone conversation to discuss these positions and determine whether or
not you may have interest or may be able to assist with these openings.

Please reply or call me at 630-990-7510 at your earliest convenience.  I
look forward to speaking with you soon.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

FYI

To our customers and counterparts:

As of Sunday, November 18 our OASIS and E-tag servers are running on PPT.
The only business practices we are changing now, is that our OASIS
transmission products are all based upon PPT.  Our scheduling system/e-tag
server is also running on PPT.  However, we can and will continue to accept
e-tags in any timezone, as long as the profile has a valid OASIS
reservation.  We will also continue to check out with our counterparties in
the time zone that we have historically used with each neighboring control
area.  

The cost?  $4.79 for a tall, skinny latte' and a plain bagel with light
cream cheese for our programmer.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 208-388-2243.

Thanks,

I will concur with Cara's response of nothing serious as to bring up in a formal setting.  

Diana

Alan,

The forwarded message below contains an issue cited by Dick Ingersoll back in June of 1997 in which Control Areas were changing the properties of our submitted schedules/transactions (tags?) and not informing us.  In a subsequent letter in September 2000 Dick had noted an imporvement but with Enron still experiencing some minor problems.

My question(s) to you and the traders/schedulers are, are the problems noted above still occuring, is this still causing us problems and if so are there specific incidents that you can provide to me so I can pass them on to the WSCC?

Please accpet my wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving!

Kind Regards,

Dave

3/14	I found the 142 mw discrepancy.  Fixed it too.  But I'm still off with you.  Your sales and purchases don't match by 2 mw>???  I agree wtih 4326 total mwh's
	Purchases: $895776.78
	Sales:  $ 890921.78

3/22	The 35 mw is actually 36 and you are right its the loss rtn, but we return those to you @ zero cost and should not be included in our totals.
	Purchases:  2537 MW 	$ 915,712.31 - we check here
	Sales:	2537 MW  $911,055.41

organizations across the country looking for energy traders, coordinators,
analysts and schedulers.  These are great opportunities to change location
or better ones position quickly.  I'd like to schedule a ten minute
telephone conversation to discuss these positions and determine whether or
not you may have interest or may be able to assist with these openings.

Bill, 

There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST.  CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance.  I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.  We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late.

taken care of.  Sorry for the delay!

Diana:

Today I reviewed NCPA related deals for 11/1-11/6 and found:

11/1 => good
11/2 => somehow the lightload sale side (deal 517676.1) is only showing HE1-HE6 in the scheduling system now.  I wonder if someone deleted HE23-HE24 afterwards (*on the lightload purchase side we have both HE1-HE6 and HE23-HE24, deal 517673.1).  
11/3 => good
11/4 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
11/5 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
11/6 => annuity missing (no power delievered)

Please let me know if you could restore the HE23-HE24 for 11/2 back in the scheduling system if they should be there, also please let me know when the missed annuities are entered.  I have also attached my worksheet for your convenient reference.

This is the schedule that was sent to gas control.

(Embedded image moved to file: pic01588.pcx)
 - pic01588.pcx 

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

	

yes we control the flow into TW.

Darrell - Doesn't TW operate the Florida interconnect?

The operator for oba contract 21580(Amoco Abo) in our system is Arco Oil and Gas.  The operator for oba contract 24828(Amoco Florida) in our system is Amoco Production.  I think that the correct operator for both of these contracts should be BP Energy.  

Lorraine and Christine - Should BP Energy be listed as the operator for these contracts?  If so - Dennis, what do you need to make appropriate changes in our system?

fyi

The pigs arrived at Gallup about 1:00 pm, and were pulled  out of the trap for inspection. We found very little
liquid and about a gallon of yellow chalk looking powder. The pigs showed to be worn some, and that may indicate
 there was not liquid in the line.  We blew the scrubber before and after the pigs arrived and found no liquid in it. We will
go ahead and run another set of pigs om Monday 10/15/01 and we let everyone know the results then. We are going to send the samples we pulled into the Lab. next week, if you have any questions please give use a call..........Gallup Team..Pat

good job!

Darrell called and informed us that there is a turbine down at the Fullerton Plant POI 36511.  For the Gas Day of 10/17 we will need to  confirm down the location to 18,000 dth.  Darrell is changing the capacity for the Gas Day of the 18th through the weekend. We have contacted the operator and we are expecting a call back to instruct us for Gas Day 10/17 confirmations. We need ensure that the gas remains confirmed down through the ID2 cycle. 

If you have any questions please contact either Cara (5-2871) or Chris (3-4826)

According to the imbalance sheets we continue to over deliver to the two above mentioned I/C's.
We need to short them 3000 a day.  Please build this into your plans.

Thanks DS

When we slow Gallup down or take it down to avoid the electric peaks, please log it.  This will help the field to keep 
track of the days and give Rich Jolly and David Roensch (Tiny) the information they may need to answer questions.
Your help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks DS

Was on a conference call with Keith (TW gas control) and Ken Gruel (Griffith plant) Monday morning (September 3) 
concerning pressure drop at the Griffith plant.  It was discovered that the TW mainline setpoint had been changed to 
reflect the new order of 35,000 for the day.  The plant sent TW a schedule of hourly burns for the day.  They had 
intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs.  Asked Keith to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately 
120,000.  
After speaking with Keith off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from Ken on their takes asked him to figure
the hourly take for the 24 hrs.  He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.  The Griffith plant has been on line
since sometime in April and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers.
Asked Keith to call Ken back with Griffith and make sure they had Gas controls E:mail address and or fax number to send
any revisions.

Ron we will need to be on the first flight out Monday morning in order to attend the PNM meeting Rick wants us to attend.

DS

I made room reservations for the 3 of us on November 5 only at the Sheraton Uptown (505-881-0000).  The rooms are not guaranteed past 6:00 pm.  Our confirmation numbers are as follows.

		Ron M.		118587
		Darrell S.	118588
		Dennis A.	118590

I checked on flights and the best bet is a 2:30 pm flight arriving Albuquerque at 3:36 pm (next one wouldn't get in until 7:37 pm).  Flights back to Houston are 2:40 pm and 4:30 pm arriving at 5:37 & 7:37 pm respectively.  I vote for the 4:30 pm flight to make sure we don't run short on time.  

LET ME KNOW ASAP MONDAY TO BOOK.  Right now the fare is  $156.25 & non-refundable.  Not sure what it will be Monday.

Kim,

I don't know your plans in and out of Albuquerque so I didn't book a room for you.  I thought you were headed elsewhere from Albuqueruque.  Let me know if you want me to do something on arrangements.

Ron M.

The itinerary looks good to me.

Thanks DS

Ronald,

Please review the itinerary with him, and let me know if I should
issue the ticket.

Darrel attached is an e-mail sent out to the North Team approved by Gary concerning the Trailblazer outage.  Gary did not plan on posting the rescheduled Trailblazer outage for Nov. 8, since it will not affect throughput.

James

This is a correction to the Trailblazer outage, the outage has been rescheduled for Nov. 8 and is an outage on NNG side of the pipe.
Per Gary this outage has been worked out between both Trailblazer and our Gas Controls to not affect throughput.

James

This information is for internal use only, Gary Spraggins is not going to post this outage on our Web. Site.

James

The outage planned at Trailblazer Beatrice Point 1318 for Oct. 30 has been rescheduled for Nov. 6 by NGPL.  This is a 16 hours outage on NGPL side of the pipe and is not a NNG outage. This information was supplied by Gerry Graves of System Planning.

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=

There will be a TW imbalance meeting after the gas control meeting tomorrow - Tuesday June 26th

 

I had to wait to get back to you this morning, sorry I will not be able to be there.  I need to leave 
at 2:00 pm today to take my daughter to the dentist.

I sent a message out last week regarding this meeting for today that Jo Williams requested and have not received a response from you.  Please let me know if you are available or if I need to reschedule.

Meeting time:	3:00 - 4:00 pm
Place:		(VCR) 4102/696

Darrell,

Like we talked about yesterday, Tri-States has decided to do some switching around on their equipment and in our sub-station. They still plan to change their insulators on July 12th but it should not effect operations at Gallup. Sorry for the false alarm.

Korey / Gallup Team

this is a test.

I would appreciate discussing any issues or concerns you might have with regards to Griffith.  I think I will be able to save you some time and effort here.   Please contact me on my cell phone for the remainder of this week (520-853-3253).  

An update on TW mainline capacity west of station 4 after last weekend's efforts.  Using my tuned hydraulic model (with updated friction factors using current SCADA) and the current efficiencies and available power, and adjusting ground temperature to August conditions, I project we can transport a net of 1082 MMSCFD.  At 1010 BTU, this is an equivalent of 1093 MM/D.

Note that the overall unit efficiencies and pipeline roughness did not change significantly from previous models.  What did change is the net available power (as generated by Jon's speed uprate algorithm).  The net result is a net increase in gas horsepower at Stations 1 & 2 by ~4%.

Note that the margin is very close to the 1090 firm volumes.  We will want to monitor operations closely to ensure we maintain unit efficiencies/power output.  We may have to do some unit repairs during tariff months as nominations allow.  This may entail repairs on the weekends.

I also note (as Mr. Schoolcraft pointed out to me) that we are seeing a large fluctuation in the flows at Griffith  (110 MM/d for 30 minutes, off for an hour, cyclical).  From what Darrell has told me, this is due to the way Griffith's flow/pressure control is configured with their dual feed interconnect.  Modifications to the interconnect controls that would smooth these flows would enhance deliverability.  Ideas anyone?  Earl, do you have pipeline/interconnect drawings & EFM/control information on this station for my review?

As part of the control modifications at stations 1 & 2, the remote speed setpoint (from Houston Gas Control) has been deactivated.  Currently Station 2 is being limited by differential pressure control at 175#.  I recommend setting the differential setpoints out of range (200#) and dispatching only on discharge pressure control.  This will ensure we are not limiting power output due to differential pressures.

I have made the changes to the CAS Group tables in Development. Attached is a report of the Updated data. In the column headings, I have indicated where the Group names would be visible. 

I have one suggestion.

The Secondary Group Name (lack of a better name) that will be displayed on the Unsubscribed Report, should I rename those six groups to the name that is currently displayed on the report, then there would be no change to the Customers except that there are less groups. 

Let me know.

I will move forward to moving the changes into Model Office, I will inform you when this is complete. Any questions, please call me @37317.

I agree with lindy that non-physical points be excluded.

DS

I think TW should exclude non-physical points.  This seems to be addressed in "What needs to be added" where it says "Listing all physical points valid for transport", but I'm sure it would clarify things to have that non-physical points should be excluded in the "What points to include" category. 

Lindy,  Darrell, & Perry

After reviewing this list, should TW exclude non-physical points like NNG?

Lindy, this is the report that I was referencing in the notes from the meeting with Jeanne. I have copied Toby since he worked on this last year. Do you and Darrell and Perry agree?

Hey guys, 

Is there anytime today that we can meet to be sure we are all on the same page concerning P-3 and Halley issues?  My main concern is P-3, and its ability to handle the volumes we may need (pre- and post-modifications).  It seems Station 9, and the lower MAOP due to class location between P-3 & P-2, could put us at risk in various cases.

I am on vacation all next week, so if we can't do it today, Eric can set up a meeting with the rest while I'm gone.  I really don't want to let this go any longer than is necessary.

Let me know about today.

Thanks,

-Morgan

 

The plan for the weekend is to cut the volume flowing down the A-line to around 30mmcf/day this should reduce the moisture at Bushton significantly.  We plan to resume the sweep after the holiday and hope to have it completed in a timely manner.  If their are any questions or comments please let us know. Personnel can be reached at either number through the weekend.

Darrell,
We have an EBS customer visit from Continental Airlines coming through tomorrow, Tuesday, July 3, 2001.  This visit is going through Joe Edwards, Director, EBS and Sarah-Joy Hunter, Director, GSS.

They are two people from their IT department coming in to discuss a Bandwidth deal. This is all the information I have at this time.  I do know that they are pretty far into their discussions and this could be a substantial deal for EBS

We wanted to give them an overview of Enron's pipeline business (approx. 15 minutes max).  

They would arrive at 1:30 pm.

Please let me know.

Thanks!
Jennifer

I will keep gas control informed on this outage.

Just so you guys will be in the loop. We will get in an outage scheduled for September after tariff.. Rick

I talked to Jim about this today. He is going to contact the transformer people (Virginia) to see what they recommend. Jim is thinking they should stand behind this repair since it is a manufacturing problem. Since we are in tariff and no urgent problem exists at this time, maybe gas control will give us 8 hours in September to make the repairs.
Sorry it took so long to respond but this one got lost in my e-mail.
Thanks for your help Jim. We will talk again in week or so.

Thanks, Korey

Why are we doing a hot tap?  Is this a new I/C?   If so is it a receipt or delivery.  Seems like gas control doesn't know anything about it.

Thanks ds

On Monday, July 9th commencing at 0700 we will be doing a hot tap on the TW 24" panhandle lateral at the Rockwell Place meter near Canyon, Texas. This is merely a courtesy notice as the scope of work will not require any manipulation of line pressure or interruption of service. 

Thank you,
Eric Haiduk

I plan on being in both days let me know what works best for you.

DS

By the end of next week, I will have the planned 2002 overhaul schedule for TW.  I would like to meet with you so you are abreast of what we have planned particularly  on the mainline.  We have developed the plan assuming units on the mainline, currently in PHFFU, will be necessary to meet system capacity.  I will be on vacation the week of July 16th, returning the week of July 23rd.  I suggest an afternoon meeting on July 25th or anytime on July 26th.  Please advise as to which one of these dates works for you.  Please advise if anyone else should be included in the meeting.

Thanks, Gary M

When PG&E does a re-alignment on the weekend, please contact the TW logistics person and let them know so it can get scheduled.

On a second note:
When PG&E requests to swap volumes to Socal the actual flow has to take place at the Topock points only.  They cannot take it to 
Needles.

If you have any questions please call.

DS

Thanks for the info.

We are moving the tap from the side of the pipe to the top of the pipe on an existing tap(Rockwell Place)  to lessen the likelihood of fluid entering the customers equipment.

I received a call from Ben Tanner saying that 2 discrete points have been discovered to not be working at Griffith Power Plant (Citizens).

CITZ.1001	General Alarm 2" Rotary Meters
CITZ.1002	General Station Alarm

They are working to see what is going on and will let us know when they are working.

Also, George Marshall found out that the Accums for the 2" runs on both the TW and El Paso side do not appear to be resetting at gas day.  Calls have been place to Citizens to follow up on this.

Let me know if you have any questions,

Darrell,

Are these correct?  These will definitely affect the TW allocations AND Outages you post.

I have changed the point / group lookup when posting TW notices through the Informational Postings Administration Utility.  It now takes the group information from the CAS system instead of PLE.  Please take a look at it to make sure it looks right.

Go to http://172.30.200.203/ebbadmin/notices/default.htm and log on as "ebbadmin","august2000".  Go to enter a new TW allocation and press the "POI/Lateral" button from the notice detail window.

	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles "window" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.

Citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today.  TW will be taking over the operations
and monitoring the Griffith plant on Citizens behalf.  We will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have
a call out sheet for Citizens personnel.  We also will be responsible for the operations at the plant.  Currently
in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW.  Please get familiar with the points
and how set points will need to be sent.  To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1.  TW will be at 2.
When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control.  Set points less than
140,000 will stay on flow control.  We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and 
El Paso.  Currently we have orders just off of TW.

1.  Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000.
     this is on flow control.  
2.  When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure.   We
     will just have to experiment with the best operation. 
3.  Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C.  We are working with Citizens 
     to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.) 

I put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review.  
If you have questions we can get with Craig Lipke with Citizens and ask for their help.  Last conversation with him
was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation.  In other words they really don't
know which is the best way to operate.

This is the E:mail we received about the Ivanhoe dehy maintenance.  Will you
please respond.

Thanks DS

FYI........

I failed to identify myself on the note below. I am the Operations Foreman
for St. Johns Operating # 1 L.. P.  We have a total of 7 wells in the
Higgins Tx. area shut in. Our daily loss of production is 1.9 MMCFD. This
loss is hurting our cash flow very badly. Your attention to this matter is
greatly appreciated.........

In early June 2001, GPM/Duke Energy informed me of the planned shut in for
maintenance on your processing plant in western Oklahoma. The planned
maintenance was supposed to be for the period of 6/12/01 thru 6/29/01. On
6/28/01 I received notice that the shut in would continue until 7/9/01 due
to "waiting on parts/material"
On 7/8/01 I received a notice that the shut in would continue until 7/13/01
due to "waiting on parts/material". On 7/10/01 I recieved a notice that the
shut in would continue until 7/18/01 due to "waiting on parts/material".
When I checked as to the status of the project early the morning of 7/18/01,
I found that the shut in would continue until 7/27/01 due to " waiting on
parts/material".

When is the parts/material ever going to arrive?

Was this a planned shut in?

This has turned out to be very, very, costly to your customers. Are their
any plans for any compensation to them?

Below attached is the TW summary report we have been working on for the past several months.  I will 
be glad to explain the details.

DS

Please see attached SUMMARY-ONLY version of TW Daily Balance Report.

 

I wanted to let you know that I have consulted the leading experts in the field, and all of my son Matthew's textbooks (he's seven), and arranged the letters of the alphabet in their proper order. Whew! The formula notations have been corrected to reflect this new-world-order. I will forward to all of you explanations of the formulas this week.

Remember, the far-right columns R,S and T are still being worked on! Don't bet your house on them.

As always, call me if you have any questions.

Darryl can you use this as your senario cards...    What I think we should do is as follows:  I will give you a call at 11:30 CST insuring that you are at the gas control board.  I will call you on your cell phone (713-826-4223) and stay in contact with you for the first 10 minutes or so.  When all the players are in place (Mangement, Local Emergency Planning Committee representative, you, etc....) I will initiate the drill by verbally telling you to start.  

At that point you will hand the controller on the board a note stating: 
1)  This is a mock situation, do you understand that this is a mock situation?  
2)  Tell the controller that with all communication they make from this point forward they will need to make it clear to start each message or phone call with "This is a mock emergency do you understand." 
3)  Pass out the first Step information on a piece of paper at the given time....
4)  Pass out the second Step information on a piece of paper at the given time....
5) and so on......

Step 1 -  11:30 CST 
Loss of pressure (and flow, if flowing) at the Citizens Kingman TBS.

Step 2 - 11:32 CST
Loss of pressure and flow to the Griffith power plant and North Star Steel.  (As Darryl and Tiny will be in continuous cell phone contact, Roger will now know that as Step two is handed to the controller he will need to initiate the call to the OCC simulating a call from a contractor that has hit our line.)  

Step 3 -  11:38  CST
Discharge pressure increasing quickly at Station 1.  Supply pressure slowly dropping at Needles and Calpine.  
(Trying to simulate mainline valve line break activation.  At least one of them.)

Assumption is that the OCC would notify Gas Control and Team????  (wait to see what happens from there)  Darryl make whatever modifications you feel would enhance this drill.  I know you are more familiar with what your folks should expect to see.  The main thing we are trying to simulate is a rupture on the Kingman TBS lateral which will activate a line break between the Kingman TBS and Station 1.  No line break down stream of the Kingman TBS will activate...  Therfore we will see the pressure dropping at Northstar, Griffith and eventually at Needles and on the Topack Lateral (Calpine, Mohave, and PG&E...)  Let me know your thoughts..   

Darryl and Tiny will remain in contact for a few more minutes and Roger will be on location with Tiny so we should have a closed loop on communications.  Arnie Bailey will monitor the conf. bridge from Roswell.  

Any questions give me a call as I will be in meetings for the next two days so drop me an e:mail or get me on my cell....  thanks....

At the moment the Griffith Facility is still shut down because of a valve
failure in the steam system.

The earliest anticipated need for gas would be Saturday morning, July 28.

The task at startup will be to blow steam through the system at high
velocity in order to purge possible debris from steam lines.  In this
situation, gas will be needed but electric power will not be produced.

I will update everyone tomorrow morning on our plans for the weekend.

Ken

Dale will call you this afternoon.

DS

 

I will be out of the office next week on vacation.

Monday July 30    out

We will be running a PII Smart Pig in the mainline in section 8 and 7 during the week of September 17th.  The proposed schedule is as follows:

Monday - 9-17-01 - Safety and tailgate meeting at 1:00/PM MDT at Station 8 (Corona).  Load smart pig in station 8 mainline launcher.  Set out AGM's
Tuesday - 9-18-01 - Run smart pig from station 8 to station 7 (section 8 mainline).  Relocate AGM's as needed.  Receive pig at station 7, clean it and put it in shop.  Retrieve all AGM's
Wednesday - 9-19-01 - PII will retrieve data and prepare the pig for the next run.  Load smart pig in station 7 mainline launcher.  Set out AGM's.
Thursday - 9-20-01 - Run smart pig from station 7 to station 6 (section 7 mainline).  Relocate AGM's as needed.  Receive pig at station 6, clean it and put it in shop.  Retrieve all AGM's.
Friday - 9-21-01 - PII will retrieve data and prepare the pig for shipping.  Travel home.

Cleaning pigs have been run in both sections as gas flow allowed.  A TD Williamson representative will be on site next week to witness cleaning runs to verify the pipe is clean enough to smart pig.  TD Williamson Caliper Pigs have been run in both sections and indicate there are no restrictions in the pipe that will affect the smart pig.

Suggested lodging:
Monday the 17th - Smokey Bear Motel - 505-354-2253.  Located in downtown Capitan.  Make your reservations now or you may have no room.
Tuesday through Thursday - Best Western Oak Tree Inn - 505-861-0980.  Located on West side of I-40 at the middle exit at Belen, NM.  30 miles South of Albuquerque.

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

                    Kenneth G
Becky:
There will be a meeting at 3:00 PM MST today to update our startup plan.
My predicion this morning was that we would not need gas before Monday,
morning July 30, but there is a slim chance that startup may occur late
Sunday, July 29.

The good news is that the gas requirement for the startup day will be less
that 10,000 MMBTU's.  Can we take that much on Sunday if they get ahead of
schedule?

By copy to Kim:  We do not expect to make any MW on the startup day. In
fact after the Steam Blow activity, we will shut down for several hours to
put the steam piping back in an operational state.

Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday should work for me to participate on the conference call...   thanks
	

Gentlemen, here's the first round.

I would like to set up a meeting to go over the outages on TW for 2002. The attached outage report includes the outages I have in the system data base. All the dates are up for discussion, thus the reason for this meeting. If there are any other outages the group is aware of for 2002, this would be a great time to put them on the list. That way we can work on the best plan for 2002. I would like to set up a conference call sometime next week. Maybe Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, let me know. If your plans allow you to be Houston would be even better.

After talking with Ken and our Gas Control it appears we had and operater error, a setpoint was put in at the TW mainline.  The problem
was corrected and the plant pressure came back.  We think with an open line of communications between the plant and gas control
we hope to minimize the mistakes.  If any other concerns please call.

We will need to start operating the Griffith plant TW and El Paso points.  Refer to the previous memo that was sent suggesting
the operations.

DS

I received a call from Sarabeth Smith stating that as of 3:00 PM today (July 31) we have a signed agreement with Citizens.  The plant is not expected to come back on line until Thursday or Friday per Darrell.  Amy is coordinating a conference call with Craig Lipke to transition the transaction management to TW.  Darrell will notify Gas Control that we are taking over the monitoring of alarms and set point (flow/pressure) control.  I will coordinate the labor distribution for both Gas Control and Customer Service. 
I want to express my thanks to Darrell, Dale, Terry, John and Amy for helping to put this deal together.  ( And of course the field personnel!)

When operational capacity changes during any cycle the below comments will need to inserted into the point
or group comment section in CAS. 
1.  Socal Window
2.  Low line pack inventory
3.  I/C or plant non performance
4.  High line pack inventory
5.  Compression status
6.  Other
  
*During normal business hours except for Evening and ID-2, Myself, Gary, Steve, Terry, or John should be 
 responsible for loading comments into CAS unless the Reps. have been given the directive to update comments.
*Weekends, and Holidays, Reps. will be loading comments into CAS.
*When new points or groups show up to be allocated that have not previously been allocated, you will need
 to page me or in my absence Gary, Steve.  We will let you know what to do with the capacity either update
 or allocate.  
If you have any questions please call me or page.

Thanks DS

Note: This schedule is optimistic.  We were supposed to do this much today
and were not able to achieve it due to several CT Trips.
For natural gas purposes, 60,000 MMBTU might be a better guess.

Hi there David!

For now we are using the plant estimates you send us via email to determine
the maximum volume we need to confirm.  As the plant has updates thoughout
the day regarding when and how much will be pulled, you should contact our
Gas Control at 713-853-5533.  There will always be a Gas Controller on
call.  I will work primarily with Maryanne from Duke, Dave Smith from PPL
and our Gas Control to determine that scheduled volumes and actual flows do
not get too far out of whack.
Attached is the contact sheet we will be using in addition to the contact
list we have from our meeting out at the plant.
(See attached file: EAMRCitizensContacts.doc)
If you have anymore questions, email me back, or my phone number is
713-853-0439.
Thanks!
Amy Mulligan

   Effective August 1, 2001, Enron Asset Management Resources will be
   acting as agent for the Citizens Communications Company at the Griffith
   interconnects on both Transwestern and El Paso.  I will be the primary
   scheduler in charge of communicating with the plant regarding its needs,
   confirming the gas at both interconnects, managing the OBA's, and
   allocating flows to the owners of the plant.

   In order to ensure a smooth transition, I will probably be in close
   contact with each of you.  For the time being, we will use the burn
   estimates which come from the plant to determine our confirmed volumes
   on Transwestern and El Paso, as well as daily discussions we have with
   Duke, PPL, and our gas control.  In my absence, the rest of the
   Transwestern scheduling team will be trained to do the daily
   confirmations and work with gas control with regard to daily flows.

   Thank you for all your cooperation.  If you have any questions, please
   feel free to call me.

   Sincerely,
   Amy Mulligan

We are now in the process of planning a total Griffith Plant Outage to fix
equipment deficiencies.
Most likely start of Outage is on Sunday Aug. 12.  (earliest Saturday)
Duration of Plant Outage is approximately 6 days.

We have been running very steady for the last couple of days.  However,
please be advised that prior to the outage, various operational tests are
being planned.  During this time, MW output will be variable and difficult
to schedule. May I request your indulgence as we work through this phase.

Tomorrow morning, the Startup Manager will produce a list of tests to be
run prior to the outage.
As the Test Plan is developed, I will keep everyone informed as much as
possible.

 

At this time I see no problems.

Team Gallup,
We will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in section 5 (both lines) during the week of August 27th.  This run is a free run from TD Williams to try to lock down the locations of the dents in both lines near station 4 that we were unable to locate during the dig outs.  Prior to running the tools, we need to do two pig runs in each line for cleaning.  Hopefulling it can be done during the week of the 20th.
I've spoken with Gary Choquette and he requests to be informed before and after each pig run so he can check efficiencies.  
Please let me know for sure that these pigs can be run during the stated time frames, and also if you will need support help.  I think you indicated that you would need 2 people during the week of the 27th.

Darrell,
No flow restrictions will be needed for these pig runs.  The pigs, including the caliper tool can run at any speed.  We will need at lease 120mmcfd flow through station 5 to keep the pigs moving.  Do you see a problem?
Also, during the week of August 20th, we will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in the mainlines in sections 7 and 8  (station 8 all the way to station 6).  Again we will need enough flow to keep the pigs running, preferably 200mmcfd or more.  Do you see any problem?

Thanks,  Arnie

Also, during the week of August 20th, we will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in the mainlines in sections 7 and 8  (station 8 all the way to station 6).  Again we will need enough flow to keep the pigs running, preferably 200mmcfd or more.  Do you see any problem?

Thanks,  Arnie

We are showing steady operation at 160 MW Gross on the CT's.  With Chillers
at full capacity we will get another 10 MW on each CT.

Arnie or Walt can either one of you set up conference call tomorrow with all the above mentioned and discuss
Thursdays P-2 to P-3 pig run.  Please let us know.

Thanks ds

Darrell,
Per our phone conversation this morning, I'm requesting gas to run pigs on the Panhandle Lateral next week.
Preferred Schedule:
  Tuesday - 8-14-01 - River to P-1
  Wednesday - 8-15-01 - P-1 to P-2
  Thursday - 8-16-01 - P-2 to P-3
I spoke with Tony Teakell and he said they can run the pig from P-2 to P-3, even with short notice.
If you and/or Gary can't get the flows at these times, contact us as soon as you know, so we can work around it.
Thanks,  Arnie

Chillers are now off.  MW output on CT's reduced to 145 MW gross.
Showing 150 MW on both CT's later today as a guess that some Chiller
capability will be restored.

Steam Turbine reduced to 225 MW

(Embedded image moved to file: pic03548.pcx)
 - pic03548.pcx 

Notes:
1) Now anticipating relatively stable operation at reduced MW throughout
the weekend.
2) Testing upsets delayed until Monday or Tuesday.
3) Plant Outage start date also delayed until mid next week.
4) Showing 150 MW average for CT's.  Actual will depend on Chiller checkout
progress.

RSVP to Alma Carrillo and specify session you are attending.

This is for smart pig runs.  I have already let PNM know that Rio Puerco will not be able to flow to TW for the
18th -- 20th.  

Thanks DS

Good news for once.
I just spoke with Mike Blount with PII.  He indicated modification of their 1.5 D Tool is technically feasible and modifications can be completed in time to do both pig runs as originally scheduled (Sept. 18 and Sept 20).  He will let us know what this cost will be early next week.  (Maybe that's the bad news part.  I hope not).

Anyway, we're back on our original plan.

Max 

We will be running a TD Williamson Caliper tool in the mainline in Section 8 and 7 the week of August 20th.  The following week we will be running the tool in both the mainline and loopline in section 5.  The proposed schedule is as follow:

Monday - 8-20-01 - Safety and tailgate meeting - 1:00/PM MDT - at Station 8 (Corona) - set out AGM's
Tuesday - 8-21-01 - Run tool from Sta. 8 to Sta. 7 (Section 8 - Mainline) - pick up AGM's
Wednesday - 8-22-01 - Retrieve data and set pig up for next run - at Station 7 (Mountainair) - set out AGM's
Thursday - 8-23-01 - Run tool from Sta. 7 to Sta. 6  (Section 7 - Mainline) - pick up AGM's
Friday - 8-24-01 - Retrieve data and set pig up for next week in Gallup - at Station 6 (Laguna) - travel home
Monday - 8-27-01 - Safety and tailgate meeting - 1:00/PM MDT - at Station 5 (Thoreau) - set out AGM's
Tuesday - 8-28-01 - Run tool in Loopline to Sta. 4 (Section 5) - pick up AGM's 
Wednesday - 8-29-01 - Retrieve data and set pig up for next run - at Station 4 (Klagetoh - Haul pig to Sta. 5 - set out AGM's
Thursday - 8-30-01 - Run tool in Mainline from Sta. 5 to Sta. 4 (Section 5) - pick up AGM's
Friday - 8-31-01 - Retrieve data from pig - at Station 4 (Klagetoh) - travel home

Cleaning pigs are being run in Section 7 & 8 as gas flows allow.  Cleaning pigs will be ran in Section 5 during the week of Aug. 20th.  

Gallup - please notify Gary Choquette before and after each cleaning run and caliper run in Sect. 5 so he can check efficiencies.

Teams, please let me know who on your teams will be available for these caliper runs so I can set up support help as needed.  I know that Gallup will need 2 support people the week of Aug. 27th.

During the week of Sept. 10th there will be a TD Williamson representative on site to determine if Sections 7 & 8 are clean enough to smart pig.  Teams Roswell, Mountainair and Laguna will need to run the cleaning pigs until acceptably clean.  The smart pig runs in Section 7 & 8 is scheduled for the week of Sept. 17th.  I will send another e-mail dealing with the smart pig.

The pig runs on the Panhandle Lateral this week were a success.  Liquids received are as follows:
P-1 - 500 bbls
P-2 - 500 bbls
P-3 - 350 bbls
We really appreciate everyone's efforts to make this happen as smoothly as possible.  It's a lot of work from the teams and a lot of trouble for gas control to get the gas flows needed, but still necessary to do.
I suggest we look at pigging the lateral again during the week of Sept. 10th.  This time we will need to run a pig from Sta. 9 to the Pecos River on Monday and then sweep the river crossing.  The run from the river to P-1 would be Tuesday, P-1 to P-2 on Wednesday and P-2 to P-3 on Thursday.  Let me know if you have other thoughts on this.
Thanks,  Arnie

We need to make sure that when we have any issues concerning the Griffith plant we put something on the log.
It has been brought to our attention that we had a problem on Aug. 6th and Aug. 14th and there is nothing in the 
logs about anything.  I was here on the 6th and know they almost ran themselves out of gas because they started
pulling more than our setpoint and did not call to let us know.  If anyone can recall what took place on the 14th 
please drop me and e:mail.

Daryl,  I thought it may be more efficient to compose my question in an e-mail.

I am developing a project at this station in which the exhaust from the new LM 2500 gas turbine could be used to generate up to 15 megawatts of electricity.  After several weeks of engineering and financial analysis, I am now beginning to market the project to prospective counter-parties including local utilities and cooperatives. 

One issue that will certainly be discussed is the risk of the LM 2500 not producing enough exhaust to generate the contracted amounts of electricity.  This could occur because of either mechanical failure or loss of throughput in Transwestern's pipeline.  In the latter case, Transwestern could choose several alternatives to transport reduced volumes of gas to the CA border including reducing the horsepower in some or all stations uniformly or shutting down and bypassing some stations while others run at normal speed.  If I did this deal, naturally, I would want Station 1 to run as much as possible so I would have the exhaust needed to generate the electricity I've sold.  Otherwise I pay penalties.

My question to you is...  if volumes through TW were to decline, say 25% or so below design rate, would it be possible to keep Station 1 going at 100% and cut other stations back or does that just not make any sense?

Come by when you're ready and we'll discuss.

Thanks,

John

Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

Update for Jolly: 

Still no word or direction from Alstrom.  Operations requested assistance from Arnold Eisenstein in pushing Alstrom for feedback or direction.   At this stage, Alstrom is making an evaluation as to whether a field repair (or patch) should be attempted or if the motor should be shipped out for repairs.  Until a decision is made or direction is provided for this warranty unit, we are standing by......

Phil I just got off the phone with Arnold and we have been advised that in the morning around 5 o'clock eastern time is the earliest that Alstrom will have information for us. From talking with Arnold, Alstrom has to get permission from England before they can give us approval to pull the unit. Since the unit is still under warranty we'll need to wait on directions from Alstrom. The team is doing more testing with Alstrom during this time to try and figure out how much damage the unit has.

We do have Norm Spalding's group lining up a contractor to assist in pulling the unit and transporting it for us. I'll keep everyone undated as soon as we get more information.

We just got off the phone with Alstom at 8:15 AM mountain time. John Manson is their service manager (412-967-7165). They are flying a motor specialist in from England, but he will not arrive until 7:00 PM Friday. At the present time Alstom is mobilizing IRS from Farmington, New Mexico to assist with the removal of the motor. The motor weighs nearly 35 tons, so permits, a crane and roof removal will be required. They plan to truck the motor back to Farmington for further analysis. They will then determine the repair process. I have set up a conference call for 1:00 PM Central time today, to allow everyone the opportunity to voice any concerns and get the latest updates from John and Alstom. The conference number is 877-795-3687 access code 691205.  I welcome all help and participation.  Rick

The pressure regulator has been taken out of service at the TW Griffith I/C on the mainline.  
This is to hopefully minimize the pressure swings to the plant.  
David if you have any other comments please respond with your ideas.

Thanks DS

 

The status of the Gallup motor is as follows.  I will try to keep everyone updated as I find answers to any questions.
Please feel free to call me at 505-238-6099

The motor is in the IRS shop in Farmington NM and has had the exciter and rotor removed.  It is to the point that you can get inside and look at some of the damage but until the stator is torn down we will not be able to see anymore.  This will be a destructive move and we don't want to start this until a final decision has been made as to the process of repairing the stator.

The stator is damaged to the extent of rewinding the motor in the opinion of the Alstom rep.
The opinion of the shop foreman at IRS is that they can repair the motor but it will take 2 weeks to make the coils and 4 weeks to install them.
The other option is to see what can be done at Rugby England.
The following letter was sent to Alstom in Rugby along with some attachments of resin properties that we have on site. Paul Savory is going to contact them at 1:00am MST and discuss this with them.  I have set up a conference call on our bridge for 6:30am in hopes to get some of these questions answered.
The number is 877-795-3687  Pin  844699

The following is a copy of the letter that Paul Savory of Alstom sent his people in England.

The motor has been stripped at the IRS workshop at Farmington, New Mexico.
1 phase breaks down at around500V. The fault appears to be at the bottom of a slot, approximately 1/3 of the way down the core. Therefore it would seem that the motor needs a rewind.
Therefore there are several questions that Enron would like answers to urgently.
1 - IRS have told Enron & myself that they can manufacture new coils, strip & rewind the core & VPI the windings but this is obviously providing that we approve. attached is the spec. from the resin they use at their workshop.
2 - Would we supply a person to oversee the strip & rewind especially as Enron want to know why the motor has failed.
3 - What is the time scale for manufacture & delivery of coils from the UK.
4 - What is the time scale for a fully wound core from the UK.
5 - Is there another similar motor available that we can supply.
Please keep in mind that this motor has to meet the same criteria if it is rewound & VPI impregnated here
i.e. same rating, horsepower etc.

BP-Amoco has requested a meeting take place in our offices on the afternoon of September 11th, or anytime September 12th or 13th.

Please check you calendars and let me know when you would be available. They are interested in discussing the outage and the resulting delays in re-establishing service.  Also, they are wish to  understanding the nature of the delays, the likelihood they may be repeated in the future, how communications between our companies can be improved, and how to promote a better relationship at the operations level between our two companies.

They mentioned that they have suffered economically, and may seek some form of restitution.

Thanks for your help,

Bob  

The measurement tech should be back this week and looking at that point.  They control the flow.
Will let you know asap. as I find something out.

Darrell,
 
You faxed some stuff to Tony Gomez on Aug. 22. I was wondering if you had heard anything yet. I think you said that TW had control of the measurement at that Interconnect. Please refresh my memory on this issue. I would like to continue pursuing this imbalance as soon as any new information is gained.
 
Thanks,

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

Per our discussion concerning the needed outage at Westar Ward for aprox. 3=
 hours to dig up an underground check valve. We have scheduled to do this T=
hursday, Aug. 30th, at 08:00hrs. We do not know what kind of check valve is=
 there, so the plan is to shut down the station, dig out the check valve, d=
etermine what type of check, and then put the station back in service until=
 we can get the needed parts such as o-ring or top gasket for that type of =
check. The best case senario is that the check will be of the type that we =
can just pull the top, remove the clapper, replace top gasket and top, and =
put back in service. This will require another short outage as we can not h=
ave the parts on hand until we determine the type of check valve. Worst cas=
e senario is that the check type is not one that we can remove the clapper =
which will require us to obtain another type of check valve and replace the=
 hole check which would again require another short outage. I will get back=
 to you on scheduling the second outage as soon as possible. If you have an=

POI 500168 has been changed in CAS to 200,000 both receipt and delivery.

DS

Please note that the original POI 500168 is active/valid in PLE and available to nominate as a receipt or delivery. The new point we set up for the Interconnect (78161) has been inactivated, and will not be valid for transport.

If you have questions, please advise.

Karen Brostad

Yes, the volumes for the two physical meters should be summed and passed to POI 500168 as a net number, just like NNG does on their sum meters.

Karen

The SUM # for these two stations will be 0047109-00. Will this be used for both delivery and receipt? Sig

It has been proposed by Marketing that the new interconnect (TW/Oneok Ward County - POI 78161) be not used for nominations, but would be removed from our PLE system and that the old POI 500168 be set up as a bi-directional point for nomination purposes to accept both receipts and deliveries at that point.

All flow through physical meter #10187 (new TW/Oneok Ward County POI 78161) and meter #9089 (Existing TW/Oneok(Westar) Ward County POI 500168) will need to be summed and a new sum meter established for POI 500168.

Kevin:  Does this affect your interconnect agreement in any way?

Sigrid, can you please set up the sum meter and let me know what it is.

This change is to be in effect no later than Friday in order to be ready for September business.

If anyone has questions or concerns, please advise.

Here ya go................man there are some UGLY mugs in this shot...... And I'm not talking about Raetta either..

 

Tub the Camera man...........

In preparation for smart pigging the mainline in sections 7 & 8 in September, TDW caliper tool runs were performed last week.  We also ran the caliper tools in both lines of section 5 this week to pinpoint dents indicated last year by TDW.  They were unable to get valid data from their equipment last year and performed this weeks run at no cost.

The caliper runs were successful and the following is preliminary data:

August 21st
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 7 to Sta. 6 - No indications of dents or ovalities greater than 1.5" (5% of pipe diameter). 

August 22nd
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 8 to Sta. 7 - Three indications of dents above 1.5" - 1.71", 1.75" & 2.45".   According to PII the 2.45" dent should still leave approximately .5" clearance for the smart tool to pass.  All indications above 1.5" will need to be repaired per our procedures.  This will probably be done when making repairs resulting form the smart pig run.  This is preliminary field data and could change with further evaluation by TDW.  The full report will be complete in two to four weeks.  The TDW representative did say that any changes would be to a smaller number.

August 28th
Caliper run on Loopline from Sta. 5 to Sta. 4 - Three indications of dents above 1.5" - 1.89", 2.05" & 2.59".  These numbers should be reduced somewhat after further evaluation, taking the pig speed into consideration.

August 29th
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 5 to Sta. 4 - Four indications of dents above 1.5" - 1.61", 1.86", 2.09" & 2.09".  Again, these numbers will probably be reduced with further evaluation.

We will need to schedule repairs for any dents 1.5" or greater.  To be able to make the repairs we may have to reduce pressures to 60% MAOP.  During tie-ins on the Red Rock project might be a good time.

The smart pig runs in section 7 & 8 are on schedule and will be performed the week of September 17th.  The Sta. 8 to Sta. 7 smart pig will be run on Tuesday and the Sta. 7 to Sta. 6 smart pig will be run on Thursday.

TDW cleaning pigs will be run in both sections the prior week (September 10th).  There will be a TDW representative on site to verify the line is clean enough to smart pig.  John Gormley will coordinate the cleaning pig runs.

Great appreciation to Teams Roswell, Gallup, Laguna, Mountainair, John Gormley, Steve Tarter & TW Gas Control for the good and safe work performed.  The project went smooth.

Rich,  You did mean September 4th instead of October I hope.  I know your doing this to see if anyone really reads your e:mails.

DS

As you know the Gallup motor is being repaired by Industrial Repair Service in Farmington, NM. After a lot of discussion with Alstrom in the States and England they allowed us to have the motor repaired here instead of shipping back to England. This will save us approximately five weeks since it can be repaired in three weeks here versus seven to eight weeks in England. It will be out of the shop in Farmington on the 20th of September  and we'll be ready to install immediately. 

The repair costs will be $150,000 and we ETS will be obligated to pay the difference in what Alstrom could have did it for. We'll also ask for whatever dollars it would have cost to send it to England and back.  Industrial Repair Service is doing the job for ETS so this means we will be held responsible for the repair cost and will have to recover our dollars from Alstrom. Arnold will work with Alstom on this after the unit is repaired. I'll assist in any way I can.

We'll still have two years warranty on the motor and Alstom will be responsible to ETS for this. 

Thanks for everyone's help on this and we'll continue to have conference calls until we have the unit in service. In case you would like to join the call the next one will be October 4th at 07:30 MST. Call in number 1-877-795-3687   code 844699.

Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig
will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.  

DS

This is to advise that if we are now actively looking at rescheduling the smartpigging dates that was previously agreed upon at our Albuquerque mtg on April 11th, we need to know ASAP.  We do not have alot of flexibility in juggling schedules based on smartpig tool availability, but we can sure check and see what shakes out.

Plz let me know at the earliest possible date what the plans are here.

At Gallup last year it took about 250 mmcfd to run the pig 6 miles per hour.  If my memory is bad someone let me know.  If we can move that amount with 7 & 9 easily then there should be no problem.

Right now it looks like we can run station 9, station 7, station 6 or station 5.  We will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day.  This
will allow us to set our HP accordingly.  Unless I'm missing something Station 8 should not be needed.  However I will check with OPS team 
to reverify volumes.

Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig
will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.  

DS

This is to advise that if we are now actively looking at rescheduling the smartpigging dates that was previously agreed upon at our Albuquerque mtg on April 11th, we need to know ASAP.  We do not have alot of flexibility in juggling schedules based on smartpig tool availability, but we can sure check and see what shakes out.

Plz let me know at the earliest possible date what the plans are here.

Thanks - Max

TW - Station 6-7 & Station 7-8 Smart Pigging - C.014524/C.014527
Project will conflict with Station 8 Automation Project if conducted in September or later.  Actively chasing TD Williams and PII for their cost estimates.  Must review costs to determine if dollars are sufficient.  Project should try to be a done in August or sooner if at all possible.

Please see the attached 

                                          

Through the 21st TW owed you 36,000.  It looks like to me through the 24th TW owes you 42,000.   Amy and I agree on the numbers.
If you have any questions please call.  Since we are scheduled at max capacity we may not be able to give you gas for imbalance,
let's continue to talk on a daily basis and they can also work with gas control for this weekend.

This is TW pressure at the inlet of the Griffith I/C.

Station 1:
Unit 101 was completed on the 24th. 
Unit 103 had one bearing that was running a higher then normal temp. We decide to utilize the contractor to change the bearing. The bearing was removed Thursday evening. Due to the amount of aluminum in the bearing saddle the cleanup is taking longer than we had hoped for. I just talked with station 1, and they are in the process of installing the bearing now. If all goes well, the unit should be running in a couple of hours. 

  This should complete all the scheduled overhaul work that was planed for stations 1-4. 

Ronnie...... 

This is interesting news.  Thought you might want to know.  
I sent him pressures on TW side for the month of may per his request.

We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.  
Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.  
If you have any more questions please call. 

Thanks DS  713-853-4299

Citizens Griffith Az. I/C (Mainline Takeoff)(GRIF)

The lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the Griffith plant from TW's mainline 
has been reset at 800#.  
The lo lo pressure alarm is set at 750#.
Reason:  This should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 3 to 4 miles of pipe from mainline to 
              Griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets.  This is for our protection.  You may need to raise the
              setpoint.
For call outs for alarms TW operations is responsible. 

If anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss.

Griffith Power Plt. El Paso and TW (CITZ)

We monitor these two sites as EMAR for Citizens.  Remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer
to the call out list for Citizens.  If you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me.
The plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial Tuesday September 11.
There are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows.  Let me know what you think of 
setting TW on pressure control and El Paso on flow control.  
Reason:  TW pressure is higher and with El Paso on flow control this will allow TW to take the swing when Griffith
              has orders from both pipelines.  Let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up  
              some guidelines for us to follow.  

Thanks DS

FYI

DS

On may 26th unit 103 went down on high bearing temp #4 main bearing. In the last two weeks this bearing has been changed two other times due to high temp problems. The last time the bearing was changed Roy Smith identified a high spot in the saddle area. This would cause a heavier load on the bearing and would result in temp problems. Today (Monday 28th) we worked on cleaning up the high spot. We also identified that the bearing that was installed also had a bonding problem. The babbitt on the bearing was pealing off. We then installed a bearing and took a complete set of deflection readings. The readings on number 2/10 throws indicated that the #4 main bearing is not over loaded. How ever the readings on numbers 7/15 indicate that #14 main is loaded heavy and might explain why this bearing is running higher then normal. Tomorrow ( Tuesday 29th.) we plan on making some adjustments to the chocks to relieve some of the load. 
  On Tuesday and Wednesday the Kingman team will be changing a turbo and after cooler. Myself and Roy Smith and two Tehas crew members will be working on the main bearings. We should have the alignment and bearing problem resolved by the time the turbo work is complete. 

Ronnie....... 

FYI
We had to pull unit 2 from Plant held for future use at P-3 on the below date.

DS
At 11:23 on may 28th I had to have p-3 put on unit two to supply gas for the 130mmbtu deliveries we had sched. behind that station.

Lindy,
You are correct they are physical plant receipt points.
The Pecos Diamond plant is the straddle plant located on the Atoka Lateral.

Thanks DS

I don't think any of these are straddle plants.  (The plant we discussed previously, I think, was the Peco Diamond which is a straddle plant.)

Linda, am I correct on these 3 below?

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  Maybe you already have answers to this.

I'm afraid I asked you this question before, but I can't find where I wrote down your answer. Sorry.

Anyway, are any of these plants straddle plants, or are they "real" physical receipt points. These are the plants we're receiving gas from in May.

What is the time frame these units need to be down.  There are no postings for volume deductions.  Please someone give me
some ideas.

Thanks Ds

   

Attached is a project schedule for the month of June indicating station outages and further defining project needs for Power Services personnel.  The letters like S1, S2,... indicate location of each person.  This is a tentative schedule and and personnel and purpose is subject to change depending on information gathered by Analysts.

Unit 401 outage scheduled on June 6th requires that unit to be down for some time.  Analysis performed last Thursday indicates there are unloaders that are definitely not operating or leaking significantly.  Presently, it is unknown what kind of problems will be uncovered on inspection of the unloaders.  Information on the malfunctioning unloaders will be distributed as soon as inspections are completed Wednesday.

 

Should there be any questions, please call me on my cell phone:  806-886-8105
Thanks

Ken,

We currently have a unit down at Station 4.  If you need to work on something now is the time to do it and not wait until June.

DS

   

I made a quick change to add analysis of Station 3 & 4 during the week of June 18th.

 

I need to get with Dave Duff and have him add the new point to the map.  Dave can you do this for us.
This new point will need to be inserted under the Mapco point on the Ignacio to Blanco column.

DS

Is it possible that POI 78121 "RED CEDAR LAPLATA REC" is excluded from the TW Map? Should it be?

We've been getting 11,000 - 16,000 MMBTU/Day there and I can't figure out where it is on the map. The Receipt Zone in the POI system is "Thoreau" and the POI type is Producer Connect. I'm not sure if I should include it on my report.

POI 500538 "RED CEDAR PLANT I/C" is included on the map in the "Ignacio to Blanco" section, but I can't find the other POI.

What do you think?

We need know everyday units need to be taken down and for how long.  Depending on system conditions we may have to allocate.

DS

   

Darrell, unfortunately those who need to be at Station 4 are traveling back home from a PEP/PRC meeting we had in Albuquerque yesterday.  

Time frame to analyze the malfunction unloaders should include 3-8 hours travel for the Analyst and Division Mechanical Specialist.  Presently, outage was requested for Wednesday, June 6th, from 8am to 6pm.  Initially, that outage was to accommodate program changes to the Unit Control program.  This outage also needs to include unloader inspection, which means there will be substantial downtime of Unit 401during the day.  Do I need to provide other information because unloader inspection will be performed?

We found out last Thursday which unloaders were not functioning correctly.  I have asked Steve SanMiguel to circulate a memo detailing which unloaders are not operating correctly.  This memo should be sent today.

If outage arrangements, other than the filling made for June 6th, can be made earlier, please let me know as soon as possible.  I will be on the road headed back to Amarillo today.  My cell phone number is 806-886-8105.   Otherwise, I will assume we will be on schedule to do this work June 6th.

Thanks

Additional information

Darrell, the unloader inspection will require removal of the unloaders from the compressor cylinders.  There are approximately 2-5 unloaders requiring inspection.  Unit 401 will have to be shutdown, blowndown, and locked out of service to perform this inspection.

Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same 
scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral.  
We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances.  
Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers.  
If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.

Example:

Non-Grid--    San Juan Scheduled      870,000
ID/1                                                                875,000
ID/2                                                                875,000

Dave can you please add the new La Plata Red Cedar point to the map.
Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points.
Also please check to see if the Rio Puerco receipt and delivery are added
into the totals of the Central Area.  If they are in the total please exclude them.
Rio Puerco is a stand alone point.  Rio Puerco should still be added into the
total Transport Receipt and Delivery.
If you have questions please call.

Thanks Ds

I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run
the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams
possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they
were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream
that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes.
We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen.
If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.

Thanks DS

Gary Spraggins
06/13/2001 09:50 AM
Randy, I agree we should continue to pig the line until the liquids have been cleared out then pig it on a regular basis. We would just have to work with Darrell Schoolcraft on TW operations and NNG operations to make it happen. Their may be days that it just does not work  on one side or the other  but once the line is cleared out of liquids we should be able to find a day on a bi-weekly or monthly basis to make it happen. We will work with you any way we can. Also, I'm sure it probably has already been looked into but is there anything that  can be done as to the location the condensate is coming from or could something be done at P-2 to catch it before it goes up the Panhandle lateral.
Gary 

Randy LeBeau

06/12/2001 05:46 PM

Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line.  We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line.  Apparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line.   I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it:

The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas.  This point feeds some domestic customers.  We don't want condensate getting into this point.
There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us.  Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes.  At any given time, I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production.  If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable.  I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeks) to get it back up.
The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel.  When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point.  This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure.  The gas from Energas is NOT measured.  They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter setting.  Apparently they agreed (verbally) to supply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run.  The plant uses about 3 mmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours.  I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel.....$21,000!  Obviously we will negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage.  I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours.
Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happens.

I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region.
We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...possibly once a month.
What do you think we can do to work something out?
Thanks for any help you can give us.

We need to operate the Interconnect points between Transwestern and Northern
just like we do all others.  We have orders everyday and we need to balance
unless both pipes have agreed to work on the imbalances.
When Transwestern or Northern get into operational constraints we need
to work with all the Interconnect customers.  If customers are not in the position
to help and we have to go out of balance on Transwestern or Northern for operational
constraints, please leave myself, Gary or Steve and E:mail or telephone message

We need to be able to monitor everything there is to see just as we would monitor a TW on NNG interconnect.  
Along with the below mentioned items from Ben, we also need  All Accums, (previous and current 
mmbtu and mmcf), All Flows both MMbtu and MMcf. on all runs, 2" rotary, 4" turbine meter, 10" ultra-sonic.
All available History info..  This information request is for monitoring TW and El Paso at the Griffith Site.
Gary, Steve, Dale please review and if you think we need anything else, now is the time to speak up.  We
need as much information as possible to insure a smooth transition for gas control.  From what TW is 
hearing we could take over the operation sometime next week.  
Dale once we have the additional requests, will you foward them to Ben or would you like me to.  I will be 
glad to help.  

DS 

Steve and Darrell,

This is the information that is available from the Griffith point.  Look it over and if we need more we will have to contact Ben and have someone program the RTU's differently.

Dale

Dale,

I do not have the list of "softpoints" with me that are available to Gas Control from the Citizen's Fisher ROC, but generally remember it as follows:  (we can go over it point by point Friday when I return to Roswell if you would like)

TW & ElPaso's rotary meters: flow rate, current accum, prev accum, press and temp.
TW & ElPaso's turbine meters: no data
TW & ElPaso's ultrasonic meters: no data

TW & ElPaso's station results: totalized flow rate (it would be nice to have volume and energy accums)

All the station control registers look to be adequate.  All of the two state points that we normally would treat as Digital Inputs  are treated as Analog Input variables.

If these points are sufficient, it will be straight forward to map these to modbus registers.  If more points are required, we will need permission from Citizens to modify their FSTs.  As I stated on the conference call, this work is not difficult, but may be considered to be intrusive were we will be programming lines of code in the same area that their complex station control code resides.

Startup Target Thursday.  There is a reasonably good chance that BVZ will
make this date.

Thanks DS
Ben,

This is what I got back from Darrell on what we need to operate this point.  I will be out of the office over the next several day but you call me at home (281-852-4304) or contact Darrell Schoolcraft at 713-853-4299 if you have any question or need more information.  You should call Sarabeth Smith or Don Hawkins if there is additional programming or hardware need to make this happen.  As soon as you have any register numbers please send them to George as soon as possible.  

Thank you

Please plan to attend a meeting this Friday, June 22nd from 10:30 to 11:30 in VCR 4102 to discuss the draft Operational Capacity Procedures for TW.  Attached is an updated draft incorporating comments I've received.

 << File: firmavailcap.doc >> 
Please let me know if you will be unable to attend.  Thanks!

I'll coordinate a meeting - probably next week when TK will be back from vacation.

Linda, I have reviewed the procedures briefly - but wanted to respond as time get away.  We may want to meet on this.  I did notice that the timing on #6 will not work.  Gas Control's meeting is after the time for Limited Day posting which is 26 hours (@7:00 a.m.) prior to beginning of gas day.
Attached is a 1st Draft of some procedures for TW concerning the levels of firm capacity sold on the system.  I started with NNG's procedure and modified it for TW.  Please let me know your comments or if you'd like to meet to discuss.  We can include an approval form similar to NNG's too.

 << File: firmavailcap.doc >> 

1.  On your first request for down time next week.  You may have an opportunity this weekend 23, or 24 depending on the volumes.
We can communicate this to your Team Friday afternoon.  We can not committ to next week at this time.
2.  Your best opportunity to pull your ESD is going to be on a weekend or weekday when or flows are down to the border.
We can check every day and let you know when this may be possible.  At this time we cannot committ to your outage requests.

Thanks DS 
We will stay in touch.

Gentlemen attached are 2 outage request for station 4. Please see, Please respond. thanks sta4. << File: outage062501.doc >>  << File: ESDoutage062701.doc >>

It looks like we are over delivering 2000 to 3000 mmbtu/d at PG&E Topock everyday.  I will have the Field go out and 
take a look at the measurement.  We need to set the point approximately 5000 short every day until further
notice.  I will visit with PG&E and let them know what we are doing.

Talked with PG&E today and they would like to flow rate today and we can talk to them each day.  Our imbalance is 
85,000 mmbtu they owe TW.  I will visit with Mike O'Donnell about our imbalance.  For now use the scada point
for daily flow rates and not the spread sheet.

Wanted to pass this along -- we received this from Ray's brother who lives =
in Wisconsin.  God bless each of you!

 Dear Heavenly Father,
 We are  moved by the alarming news and crisis that our country
 is facing.   This, the greatest nation, founded in the belief of "In
 God We Trust"  and the "Land of the Free".
 Please have mercy on  those
 suffering, hurting and in fear, and give wisdom & strength to  those who
 are
 assisting.  May the forces of evil be  broken by your power and may
we  humble before thee, our strength and  refuge.
 Give wisdom to all our President & our  leaders
 and bring your  comforting peace
 through the  power of your Holy Spirit.  Help us here to reach out
 to those  that have been affected by this tragedy.
  In the name of our Lord  and Savior, Christ Jesus.  AMEN

  Please send this to all your  friends and create a prayer chain
  throughout  this  nation.

It really doesn't matter if we have sold firm or not March is still available for maintenance, as we would do it through april, may or june.
To answer your firm question.  Jan. 02 1091, Feb. 1071. Mar. 1071, Apr. 1057, May 1057.  This is what I see right now you know how 
things change.

DS

Just checking... In the previous two years we had sold firm through March which prevented us from performing maint. in the month of March.  So, my question:  Have we sold firm through March yet or is that month still available for maint. if we push this schedule up?  If I'm not making any sense give me a call. 
  Yes Ronnie, I would still like to do that for 2 reasons.

1.	It moves the overhaul on unit 401 into March, which is the same month we are doing the tie-ins at Station 1 and 3. And since there will be a flow restriction from those tie-ins we can coordinate the two outages together and save a little of the flow loss.
2.	Starting and finishing the overhauls earlier will keep us away from our summer comments, if there are problems or delays.    

       If  there are no objections, I will change the dates to the new schedule listed below. 

Jerry Graves
713-345-8923

Jerry, A while back you suggested moving the overhauls up at Station 4 to
March 1st, 2002. If its still works for you lets give it a try. The only
concerns at this time may be parts delivery time, but I think we will be
ok. The recommended outage dates are listed below. Let me know if this will
work for you. Thanks!

Ronnie........

401 start date 3-1-2002, Completion date 4-9-2001
402 start date 4-11-2002, Completion date 4-21-2001
403 start date 4-23-2001, Completion date 5-3-2001

Can you explain why we over delivered to NNG on total order.

Order:
35.397 to NNG

Flow:
57.753 to NNG

Please let us know.

Thanks DS

Disregard the below message.  Sorry about that. I've got egg on my face.  TW did not over deliver to NNG.  The previous day accums for Estes did not role in scada until a little after 10:00 am.  I did call Dale to ask if that should take that long to role over.
We are just trying to keep a close eye on imbalances.

DS

Can you explain why we over delivered to NNG on total order.

D, can we do this in January? Being a Tariff month.

Attached is a copy of the preliminary report that  recommends that the inlet pressure to Citizens "Griffith Plant" Station be  limited to 740 psig.  Note that this is only a preliminary report that  Citizens is reviewing.  Some of our "reviewers" are on vacation, and have  held up the process of getting this report finalized.
 
Since  I was temporarily assigned to another position during the time that gas was  introduced to this line, I have asked my employee Martin Conboy to create a log  of events on how these stations had been operated.  I will send it to you  later today.  
 
Can  you have David Roensch review to see if anything is missing.  I feel that  it is a good idea to document the different operation modes with results prior  to agreeing on any further changes.
 
I had to delete a couple figures to get the size  below 1 meg to email.
 
Call if you have questions.

Below is a perliminary report that Citizens sent and their recommendation.  Please note Rob's message.  
Gary will you and Tiny review the report and next week we can set a conference call to discuss what we 
think that can be done if we choose to regulate our pressure to the Citizens site.  The call will include all
the above personnel.  After we have our call I would like to call Citizens and let them know if there is anything
TW can or is willing to do, or is it a Citizens design problem.
I will let everyone know the dial in number on Monday.  I will be on vacation tomorrow.

Thanks DS

This report shows the Williams balance that has accrued in December.  

 

We need to watch this real close.  We are scheduled for a conference call with Griffith and Citizens and El Paso.
They want to discuss operational scenarios.  Jesse I will let you know when and where so you can listen and add
your view points from a gas control perspective.

Thanks DS

This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

1) Cold Start Test
     Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
     Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
     Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

3) Operation at Minimum Load:
     Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

Special Request to DETM for today is to permit Griffith to change plant
output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average MW shown
on this schedule for each hour.

Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then DETM
can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.

This is an email sent to me after my conversation with Rob last week.  I don't know where he is leading with this.  However will
every one please read the below and Jerry in my absense please work with everyone to try and come up with a solution that 
TW is willing to live with as we go forward as TW and EMAR (operators for Citizens).  
Sorry I won't be able to any help this week as I will be traveling to New Mexico for my Mom's funeral.  I will try and stay in the
loop as best I can.  Thanks for everyone's help in resolving this issue.

DS

Citizens had concerns about the amount of noise and vibration at our Citizens Plant Station and has recently had an expert on this subject visit the site and take measurements.  The preliminary report indicates that the current configuration could potentially fail at full load conditions with a inlet pressure exceeding 740 psig.  Since Citizens does not want to limit the capacity of the power-plant, we are asking that your delivery pressure be temporarily reduced to 700 psig.
I have attempted to document the different operation modes that we have observed your station operating under along with any back-ground information that I was able to document. As discussed, in the design phase of this interconnect, I was informed that batching would only occur under low flow conditions, and do not understand the benefit of batching in the manner that was done earlier this year.
Per our customers request (Griffith Energy) Citizens installed equipment capable of measuring down to extremely low flow rates that include three measurement runs.  A 10" Instrument Ultrasonic, a 4" Invensys Turbine meter, and a 2" Instrumet Rotary meter.  Although I questioned this requirement at the time, the low flow condition occurs so rarely, it is inconsequential.
I have analyzed our log files for the month of November (11/1/01-12/6/01) and found that the only time the smaller runs operate is momentarily as the power plant starts up.  The following volumes are accumulated totals per run for this time period.
Run Size        TW      Flow (Mcf)     Percent of Flow                              EPNG    Flow (Mcf)        Percent of Flow 
2"                                   107.9              0.0089%                          0.2            0.0018% 
4"                      1,280.8              0.1059%                                                 2.1                  0.0153%
10"                         1,208,076.9            99.8852%                                          13,714.4                99.9829%
My point is that in the event that you do not feel comfortable in setting your actuated valve immediately downstream of your flow control valve to take Citizens' requested pressure cut, consider temporarily using the flow control valve as  pressure control.  The month of November included considerable power-plant testing, and therefore the above numbers are higher that during commercial operation.
When TW found it's in a difficult situation in regards to finding a solution to measuring a low flow (which appears to be erroneous information), Citizens worked with you in good faith.  All we are asking is the same in return.

This is the outage for redrock tie-ins and volumes.

Is this what you were asking me for???
After discussion with Arnold Eisenstein, the following are (very) tentative=

=20
Station 2, mainline, March 18, 2002, 4 days
Station 2, loop, March 28, 2002, 2 days.

The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result fro=
m tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assem=
blies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, =
and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubber=
s will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station=
.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the st=
ation yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a =
dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of=
 the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjac=
ent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line wi=
ll produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing=
 compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respec=
tive horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in=
 work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

this wrong please correct me.  

Thanks DS

Duke would like to know what the temperature of the gas in TW's pipeline is in the Curry County, NM area is.  Does anyone know?  Thanks.

Lorraine 

Would this be something we would consider or do we need to suggest TW host in Houston.

ds
It's time to start thinking about when and where we can get together to
review the maintenance that will affect the San Juan area this year.  The
EPNG planners will have their information from the field, and we will review
it internally by the middle of February.  Can we look at late Feb or early
March?

We did not decide who would host this year's meeting when we departed last
year.  If anyone wants to volunteer, please say so.  We could consider
meeting at a neutral location (Las Vegas has been suggested).

I will coordinate our communications until someone volunteers to take the
ball.  Please e-mail your thoughts.

	SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT...........LYNDA

          The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller
          buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower
          viewpoints.

          We spend more, but have less. We buy more, but enjoy less.

          We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences,
          but less time.

          We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less
          judgment, more
          experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.

          We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh
          too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get
          up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too
          seldom.

          We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.

          We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.

          We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.

          We've added years to life not life to years.

          We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble
          crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.

          We conquered outer space but not inner space.

          We've done larger things, but not better things.

          We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.

          We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.

          We write more, but learn less.

          We plan more, but accomplish less.

          We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

          We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more
          copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

          These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and
          small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.

          These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier
          houses, but broken homes.

          These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway
          morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do
          everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.

          It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and
          nothing in the stockroom.

          A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time
          when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
          delete.

          Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are
          not going
          to be around forever.

          Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
          because
          that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

          Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that
          is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't
          cost a cent.

          Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved
          ones, but most
          of all mean it.  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it
          comes from deep inside of you.

          Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that
          person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to
          speak and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind

     <<<<

Yes I can.  Let me know when this is finalized.

Can we have a conference call Tuesday, 1/15 at 9:00 am to discuss a new well Duke would like to bring on near P-3.  I have ?s about operational issues, de-hy issues and custody transfer.  Please let me know if this time works for you.  Thanks.

Lorraine 

looks good to me.  My portion.

ds

Attached is the preliminary CA monthly report for December for your review.  Please verify the following:

TK - The rates under Item 1 (especially those highlighted in pink, which I updated manually by reviewing invoices/transactional reports)
Darrell - The operational capacity and footnotes under Item 3
Terry - The scheduled and/or nominated volumes under Item 1 and 3 (I've done some cross-validations checks but another pair of eyes will help)
Jeanette - Overall data and format for accuracy

Please provide any comments to me no later than COB Monday, 1/21/02, for updates.  Once finalized, I will email to the full distribution list.

We currently have an accumulated imbalance due TW from PNM of approximately 375,000 mmbtu.  We do not 
need to let this keep growing.  Talked with Chuck Thompson (PNM) and we both have agreed that TW is not 
to over deliver to PNM until we can verify the measurements.  We need to keep the total order in balance.
We will work on this next week.

Thanks Ds 

I don't think that decision has been made.  I think we should be allocating.  This should be discussed today at 
the TW afternoon marketing meeting.

ds

	I'm confused?  Are we allocating at this time to be sure the imbalance does not
	grow any more?  Thanks. Lynn

that would be one of our options if they don't cash out the balance as of 12/31/01

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

As of the Jan. 11 Amy got them to take their schedule down from .444 to .088 and TW is now receiving make up.  We 
will continue to watch this point.

I called Steve Richards at the station and this unit is in plant held for future use.  I told him to get started.
This is for unit 602 down from 1/16 to 5/31.  We will still have two units available.

ds

Jerry,
I talked to Ronnie Morse, and he says the outage at Station 4 is scheduled to be completed 5-3.  They will then send equipment in to be repaired or rebuilt and then returned to Station 6.  Am attaching outage request and if there are any questions, please call or e-mail. 
Thanks,
Steve/Laguna Team              << File: 602OUTAGErequest.XLS >> 

 

next week will be fine.  Let me know.

DS

As the efficiencies of the lateral (between Bloomfield and Gallup) steadily decrease it is time to probably think about pigging that section again in time for the upcoming tariff season. We will be scheduling a meeting next week to talk about the following:
1)	When should we do this?
2)	Should we also consider surfactant cleaning?
3)	It has been almost 6 months since the application of the DRA on that section. Should we re-apply?
4)	What are the costs-outages, cost of app
5)	What are the benefits.

Please let John Sturn or myself know of when you cannot make a meeting next week.
Thanks

Per Robert Baker:

The TW Valero Pecos I/C unavailable until further notice.  Will keep you updated.

Thanks DS

Yes we do and I will make copies.

Georgie Landau will be in at 10:30 for an interview. Please meet in my office. Darrell, do you have those interview questions that we have used in the past? sj

Works for me.

ds

After talking with Cliff the later part of the week of January 28 will work out the best.  Please let me know if this will not work for anyone.

Dale, please co-ordinate a meeting with Cliff, yourself, and the others copied on this list as soon as practicle. Allen, can you come to Houston to attend the meeting? I'd like to get this program going right away. thanks. sj

Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)

I would like to know where and how this is going to affect us and all the parameters.  Kim I know Mansoor is working on the project and I 
will get with him.  I would like to be included in the discussions from the beginning on new I/C ideas and locations.

DS

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday. 

Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.  

Thanks for your time,

Kim.   X33098

Melissa left a message that the volumes should start flowing to make the imbalance for the month.  They cannot 
split stream flows.

ds

I left a message with Pam Stiegerwald, I'll tell her she should move her gas, otherwise it'll be allocated.

Thanks,
Amy

3,000/day is being schedule at Wolf Creek and we are not receiving volume thus increasing Continental's imbalance.

Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled?

As of Sunday, January 20, 2002 
Griffith Power plant located off of TW's mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market.

Gas Control Issues:
Nominations:
Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements
between Duke and PPL.
You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics 
Team.

Flows:
We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations.  We will watch the noms this week to get a feel
of where and how much they may vary.  
As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella, We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your
going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order.(If this looks like it is going to be
small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers.)  
Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 (TW primary)  
When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 (El Paso primary), and flow the gas until accumed
and switch back to 1 (TW primary). 
If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it.  Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the
Site from Gas Control.
The only time we should get the Citizens people involved with the I/C is if we have a problem with Primary switches or pressure
problems.  Please refer to the call out sheet on the Console for Citizens.

Please don't hesitate to call if you need help.

Thanks DS

500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  Karen was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active
       status.
If any other questions please call

DS
       
POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The following points need updating in PLE

1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas
500168 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE as such to be picked up in TMS

56943 TW-NNG Ward-- We need to leave as Bi-directional.  Will Fernandes called back and said they were mistaken and there
                                   are still one 8" orfice run dedicated to flow gas back to TW.  They apologize for the confussion.
Burlington Jackrabbit-- Olivia with Burlington called and the point does no longer exist on their side and will not ever be using it.
                                  Does this mean we can inactivate it on TW?

I appologize for some confusion.

56943 Valero Ward -- is only a delivery and we do displacements.
1635 TW-NNG Ward -- is a Bi-directional point. 
Jackrabbit we can inactivate.

Thanks DS
Darrell,

POI 56943 has never been bi-directional in the system?  It has always been an out.  Is there another point number that was used as the receipt?
As far as Jackrabbit the field needs to call in that the point is inactive and should be abandoned.  We can inactivate the point to keep people from noming if you want to do that.

56943 TW-NNG Ward-- We need to leave as Bi-directional.  Will Fernandes called back and said they were mistaken and there

HL with Conoco let us know that the Zia plant will be down for maintenance Monday 28th for approximately 10 days.  They

As we go thru our reorganization this list may have to be changed.

Thanks DS

They had a 35,000 order and Kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline.  They sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and
he didn't look at it.  I got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes 
for a 24 hr period.  Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that.  I will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain
how Griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline.

DS 

What was the problem? sj

We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.  
Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.  
If you have any more questions please call. 

Thanks DS  713-853-4299

Sounds like to me they will still be swinging and still in the test mode.  TW will work with Griffith as we can.

DS
No matter how hard I try to get BVZ to include float in the schedule, to
allow for the "unknown things" which are bound to occur, they insist on the
most optimistic outcome and it never happens.

On Friday we will do the tests as detailed below.  After that there are
other tests which will take place before the plant goes commercial.

                    Darrell.Schoolcraft
What seems to be the problem with start up.  When you do will you be in
more test phases or commercial.

   This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

   1) Cold Start Test
        Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
        Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

   2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
        Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

   3) Operation at Minimum Load:
        Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

   Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
   plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average
   MW
   shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
   Ingram of WAPA)

   Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then
   DETM
   can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.

Just let gas control know what units you are going to have unavailable.  You can proceed with the project.

ds

Mike, I think we can go ahead and do the work. There is no flow affect right now, so I don't see a problem doing one unit at a time. Darrell what's your thoughts?

Here is a blank outage request form Mike.

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Thanks
Mike

FYI

All
Per Darrell and Jerry's comments below, we can proceed with the unloader installation at any time. I talked to Ed and had a message from Jon. Jon is tied up in Florida through the 22nd, probably. He can be at Station 8 the week of the 25th. He'll check and confirm that.

Gene and I talked and we'll plan on doing the install on both units (one at a time) the week of the 25th.

Great job.....

The South Central Team has been fielding several calls from customers regarding the status of MOPS, Cara and Chris were invited to conference with the Tivoli Area and the crew working on the leak.

The latest information as of 11:00 am Wednesday 2/13/02 is as follows:

Operations:
The earliest the MOPS system will be unavailable this Saturday 2/16/02 (  best estimate )

The diving crew has located the exact source of the leak, and they are continuing repairs.  Right now the weather condition's look favorable and the forecast predicts that the good conditions should continue.  The leak is located 160 feet below the surface which presents complications no matter the weather conditions.

At least one member of the South Central Team will listen in on the daily conference call (11:00 am Central Time) and will keep everyone updated; this should help improve the accuracy and timeliness of our information.

Scheduling:

Darrell will set the operational capacity to 0 through the 18th on the delivery locations. If the MOPS system come back on before that time the operational capacities can be brought up. This information is available on the bulletin board.

Remember to post as a FORCE MAJEURE on the allocations. If receipt points (ex:platform 762) update the point and their deliveries will be cut.  

Some customers have been calling and inquiring if they should nom. gas in the MOPS system. Noming gas is at the shippers discretion, as long as the system is down we will continue to confirm their gas to 0 and allocated the delivery points.   Please direct them to the bulletin board.  It is ok to let them know of our timeline, please stress that this is an estimate.  If you are not comfortable answering any question, please direct them to myself (5-2871), Chris (3-4826) Sherry (3-3063), or Bob Burleson (713-287-1049)

We will keep up updated as the MOPS situation continues. Cara will be on comp days Thurs and Friday-- Chris and Sherry will cover my desk and MOPS in my absence. 

Thanks,
Cara and Chris

I can be available as well at 9 this morning.

ds

I'm available after 9:00 this morning.

Darrell and Jerry,
Let's discuss on Thursday.

Jeanne - thank you for your help.
Donna

Here is the Operational Capacity for the points listed below. If you have any questions, please call me at 37317. Jeanne

 << File: pointOperationalCapacity1.xls >> 
Jeanne,
In talking with Mark McConnell, Jerry Graves and Darrell Schoolcraft we think that if you can have David Duff pull the following point operational capacity out of TCI we can determine what Mark needs.  Please go back as far as you can in the database.  Some points may not exist because they were not in place back in 93 or 94, but pull as much history as you can. 
	Name			POI           
	SoCal - Topock		0056697
	SoCal - Needles		0010487
	PG&E - Topock		0056698
	S.W. Willow Valley	0013198
	N. Starsteel		0500383
	Mojave - Topock		0056696
	Citizen - Kingman	0056659
	Citizen - 89 North	0500046
	Citizen - Forest Branch	0500619
	Citizens - Flagstaff	0500134

Darrell, Jerry and I would like to validate the information prior to forwarding to Mark, so please send me the file and I will coordinate the review.  It might be helpful to know the field names in TCI if you can't find operational capacity.  We probably called it something different back then.

Thank you for your help.
Donna

We will need to watch pressures very close and manage horsepower so we do not exceed the 939#.  We need to set alarm limits.
Will keep you updated.

DS

The decision has been made based on the latest smartpig results that the operating pressure for the pipeline section from Station 8 to Station 6 is not to exceed 939 psi until the actual status of the pipeline can be evaluated based upon the smartpig information and any necessary repairs can be made.

Additionally, a conference call for Friday (2-15) at 2:PM CST has been established to initiate discussions regarding excavations and possible repairs that may be needed.  Conference number is 877-795-3687 Code 724709.

Everyone plz try to participate in this call if at all possible.

Earl, we noted in a weekly report that this IC was approved for construction with a May 1st startup date.  [Chanley, Earl]  David, the IC has not been approved to date, a PA has been submitted and is being routed for approvals.   We gave a heads up to Jerry and Darryl that a potential interruption to flow could occur in the near future as a result of tie-ins for this IC.  Jerry and Darryl then requested that the tie-ins be made during our LaPlata outage which is a three day outage during April 2nd, 3rd, & 4th.   [Chanley, Earl]   Talked with Darrel and the Hot tap date will coordinate with other outage of April 2, 2002. Line pressure has to be lowered to 702# for welding.  I asked that Jerry and Darryl discuss the time frame of tie-ins for Questar with you, as I could not say one way or the other if you could mobilize by then.  [Chanley, Earl]   trying to get material ASAP for tap. Working on details of who buys material for the IC. Will know more next week.  

Jerry/Darryl, I did however, discuss with the Team to determine if the tie-ins occured during the same time frame as the La Plata outage, what would be the impact to manpower and scheduling of tasks at La Plata.  The Team committed to the tie-ins during the same time frame but will be asking for 4 days of down time at La Plata now versus the 3 days origianlly requested.  They will look at options such as contract labor, support team, etc... to see if they can squeeze this back to three days, but it will be a few weeks before that information is communicated.   [Chanley, Earl]  David, E&C will have the contract crews, Inspector and others in place to lessen the impact to their schedule.   [Chanley, Earl]  The team choice to extend the outage should not be based on the tap as E&C will supply any support needed, if the team has concerns, contact me and we will work them out.  

Chris Gaston will be the team point of contact for the Questar tie-ins...  Blackie Foutz will be the Team point person for measurment related issues related to design/installation.

Earl, can you provide the team with the work order number so that payroll can be charged as they become involved?   [Chanley, Earl]  As soon as it is approved and funded.  Also, can you provide the tentative date of commissioning the interconnect so that we can insure George Kniesley is available to participate along with the team.   [Chanley, Earl]  IN service is requested for May 1, 02, but will know more after meeting with Questar on who will purchase material and build.  
 
Team, charge time to the work order only as support is requested from E&C and/or is necessary as part of start up and commissioning.  

If I can do anything to help, please give me a call...

        
Jack Ohearn with Questar and Roswell E&C will meet at the Bloomfield station on 2-20-02 @ 8:00 am to determine where the interconnect will be located, TW or Questar right of way. All of the details of the IC are being worked out and TW is to own and operate at this time. Locations, design, who is to construct and equipment are issues being resolved at this time. 
If you have any questions, please let me know next week. 
I'm not sure of who the team contact will be on this project, but if the team or contact has other commitments, this meeting is to resolve the location and the team's impute is welcome. 

Thanks

Gentlemen,
 I need to schedule 2 hrs. down time ( zero flow ) for sta. 010169-01 TW / TransColorado I/C ( Blanco Hub receipt ). Starting at 09:00 MST on 3-19-02.
We are going change out a 12" turbine meter out, and visually inspect the meter tube. Rick Downey with Kinder Morgan is scheduling this with his people as well. We should be able to make up the noms. pretty easily, as they always have plenty of line pressure and lots of gas.
Thanks,
Blackie

Hi Shelley,

Through these stressful times of people moving around and the company restructuring and splitting out the pipelines, I strongly recommend that Darrell Schoolcraft remain with the TW pipeline group as manager/director of this pipeline group. He is very knowledgeable and very professional  in his duties as a coordinator and certainly would make an excellent  manager/director under any new restructuring plan. He's also been very helpful to me and others in maintaining a solid pipeline as well as keeping the lines of communication open between ourselves and our customers. Shelley, for whatever this is worth, he comes strongly recommended for this positon under any type of restructuring plan. Thanks.

Note that NGPL is making payback this month
 

Someone needs to call Jerry Graves or myself to schedule a pig run.  We will need to have some coordination to flow gas from the P-3 side
of the Canadian station to ensure you enough gas to run the pig to feldman. 
With max flows from the P-2 area they can run a pig from P-2 to P-3 anytime.  It just needs to be coordinated with the teams and gas
control.
Mickey, hope this answers you questions.  If not call me.  

Let us know.

ds   713-853-4299

I had sent you an email in regards to pigging on the TW 24" Panhandle Lateral and the TW 12" Leedey Lateral. I haven't heard anything and wanted to make sure you are still the person that we need to visit with on getting these task resolved. If not, please let me know who we need to talk to.

The problem is we haven't ran a pig on these lines in years. In order to insure our pipeline integrity, we need to work through these obstacles and get something resolved. We know we have lots of liquid in these lines and need to proceed with pigging.

Please let me know what we need to do to get this accomplished.

Thanks,
Mickey

Yes, but we are waiting to hear from Darrell on this one.

Is this an official request to amend their contract, or will they send that later?

During the Crawford outage scheduled for 3/5-7, Duke has requested to move its primary receipt point from Crawford to the Duke WT-1 receipt point.  Since there will be no flows from Crawford I think this should work.  The contract # is 27579 with an MDQ of 20,000/d.  Thanks.

We are currently pumping north at P-3 to Mid-continent I/C's and Canadian.
How are you going to get enough gas to run the pig back to P-3.  We only have 
29,000 flowing at NNG Beaver today.  If you have any ideas let us know.

We need to run the 24" pig from Canadian to P-3.

	Earlier this week I installed some new functions at station 5 for ease in controlling the pressure regulator when the 	station is down.

	Please install the following discrete and control points.  They will effect the setpoint on register 7025.

	1031 -  Input showing flow direction   0= west   1 = east

	1160 - Will put the control in West Flow  (write a 1 to this)
	1161 - Will put the control in East Flow    (write a 1 to this)

	If this doesn't make any sense please let me know.

	Thanks

Can you spot what's wrong with this picture? Look closely. It may take you a minute.

We need to get together on the digs between 4 and 5.  we will have to isolate the main and loop.  We will need
to curtail gas from SJ.  I will look at the posting I had previously.

ds

Per our discussion on Friday, attached are the spreadsheets that show the
dig locations for the integrity work. Please look at the column that shows
Mile Post since there is a lot of other information on the spreadsheet that
you do not need.  We will need to have the pipeline pressure less than 655
when we excavate these locations.  We need to discuss outage dates after you
have a chance to look at the locations and do some modeling.

 One spreadsheet shows only the dents from 8-7 and 5-4 mainline and 5-4
loopline.  All of these need to be excavated. A second spreadsheet shows the
pits from 7-6.  These all need to be excavated since they did not meet the
LAPA calculation criteria.  Then, a third spreadsheet shows the pits from
8-7 and we are planning to only excavate a couple in order to verify the
LAPA calculations with R-String calculations.  There are no dents from 7-6
which need to be looked at.

8-7
From 8-7 there are 3 dents on the mainline and they are all in an area where
the pipeline is not looped. These will all be excavated and a sleeve or
clock spring will be installed.  There are a couple of pits on the line that
will be excavated.  We will start with the pits at mile post 28.567 and
28.570.  These are in the segment of line that is looped.  If the R-String
calculations on the pits agree with the LAPA calculations, we will recoat
the line and stop with those two.  If they do not meet the LAPA
calculations, we will continue with the next closest one and continue on
until we get some agreement.  We can do the two that are not in the looped
segment last, if we have to, but we do not expect to have to excavate more
than the two.

7-6
The spreadsheet shows 19 pits that need to be checked.  However, 3 of them
have already been replaced in the Becker Flats work order, which leaves 16
pits.  Of the 16, only one is in the area that is looped.  (Murphy's law at
work here.)  All 16 pits need to be  checked and repaired with either a
sleeve or a clock spring.  However, there are really only 8 sites since some
are very close together.

5-4 Mainline
All five dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring installed.
All are in the area that is looped.

5-4 Loopline
All eight dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring
installed.  All are in the area that is looped.

Is it Marketings plan to offer this as a Primary Firm point or an Alternate.

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I second Jerry's statement below. 

ds
Jeff, 

I agree also. I believe that is a really good idea. There will be times when it is necessary to run at, or close to MAOP to move the required flows, but we do not want to run over MAOP at anytime. So, anything they can do to protect the H.P. and the integrity of the pipe would be great. 

Jerry

Hello Jerry,

Everybody seems to be in agreement to this point.  I would like your comments.  What I propose to do is ask that the high pressure shutdowns be reset as close to MAOP as possible, without shutting anything down AT MAOP.  It may take a little adjustment to find out where that point is for each station.  Any problem?

Jeff

Jeff,
The regulations are pretty clear.  192.619(a) says  " . . no person may operate a segment of steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure which exceeds the lowest of the following: . . . " and goes on to talk about design pressure, test pressure and highest operating pressure issues.  There is no leeway.  The regulations provide for the built in problem of buildup pressure in relief devices by giving us up to ten percent above MAOP to achieve full relief capacity, IF we need it due to failure of a pressure control device or system.  Operator error or roll back due to system demand changes are not acceptable justification for exceeding MAOP.

From the communications below, it looks like the high pressure shutdowns are being used more as a pressure control device than an overpressure protection device.  If this is to be the case, then the shutdowns must be set at the MAOP, not at some percentage above MAOP.  If this is done, then the relief valves must be sized adequately to prevent operating pressure to exceed the MAOP plus the allowable 10 percent buildup.  I believe that some compressors are relying on shutdown switches as primary OPP since existing relief valves are inadequately sized.  I don't know if this is the case here.

My thoughts are that if the operating pressure of a pipeline exceeds the MAOP by any amount, then the control systems should be recalibrated to prevent a reoccurrence.  If the control system has unacceptable dead band, then the economics should justify replacing it.  The economics cannot, under any circumstances, justify operating at any pressure that exceeds MAOP.

Pat

Pat, please give me your thoughts on this issue, then I will discuss with Gas Control. 

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff
I am in agreement with you.  Talk to Pat Vaughan concerning the issue.
Thanks
Dan

As you know, we have exceeded the MAOP a couple of times since I have been here.  According to the Advisors, our shutdowns for high discharge at the mainline stations are set at 1020.  This is 12 PSI over MAOP.  These shutdowns should prevent the pressure from ever getting high enough to actually blow a relief valve (at 10% over MAOP). 

Although we are allowed to set overpressure protection devices to prevent overpressuring by more than 10%,  I don't believe that this gives us permission to operate above MAOP.  My opinion is that we should set the high discharge shutdowns closer to MAOP so that rollbacks due to reduced demand, other conditions resulting in high line pack, or manipulation of pressure to excavate a line, don't result in us exceeding MAOP.   

I need to run this by Pat Vaughn, Gas Control, and probably a few others, but I thought I would start by running this by you.  Do you see any reason not to pursue this?

Jeff

 

I talked to Delma with Amoco about the fuel and she is going to get with her people and call us back.  

ds

FYI's 

PNM               -    has verbally promised to pay back 5000 mmbtus per day during March and also to pay 1/2 of the imbalance in cash
Amoco Abo     -    did not deliver volumes into TW during February and first four days of March - however, fuel volumes are being 
                           delivered into Amoco Abo Fuel point causing the imbalance to grow.
So Cal            -    received 60,344 mmbtus in payback from 3/1 -3/4 reducing the accumulated balance to 59,483 mmbtus due TW
Williams         -    Williams will be invoiced for $84,461.19 for Feb oba activity.  The balance shown on the attached summary is related
                           to March 2002
Devon            -     Devon was invoiced for their accumulated balance through 1/31/2002 - $146,678.  The balance shown on the 
                           attached summary is related to activity after 1/31/2002.  Amy will continue to follow up on the payment status.
Mojave          -      Balance shown is related to March 2002 activity.  The prior balance of 150,923 mmbtus is being resolved and will be 
                           cashed out.  This amount related to these volumes should be invoiced during 3/2002.
NGPL           -      received 89,845 mmbtus in payback during 2/2002 reducing accumulated balance to 45,621 due TW as of 2/28

I will be on vacation tuesday, March 12  returning on wednesday.

ds

We can check with Williams but can't promise anything.

ds

Now that we have all the parties involved, here is what we need. A pig needs to be ran from the Canadian River Station to P-3 on the TW 24" Panhandle Lateral. In order to be able to do this, we will need to receive gas at Canadian River Station preferably by Williams. I understand that we only have gas flow going from P-3 to Canandian, but in order for us to maintain pipeline integrity, we need to work together to make this happen twice a year. We work with Williams to enable them to run a pig, so I'm sure they would be willing to work with us. Currently this is our only alternative since we are unable to pig from P-3 to Canadian. It has been several years since this pig has been ran and the last time P-3 was flooded with fluid. 

As far as the Leedey Lateral goes, we need to pig, but economics will be hard. We will do some more leg work on this.
Someone needs to call Jerry Graves or myself to schedule a pig run.  We will need to have some coordination to flow gas from the P-3 side
of the Canadian station to ensure you enough gas to run the pig to feldman. 
With max flows from the P-2 area they can run a pig from P-2 to P-3 anytime.  It just needs to be coordinated with the teams and gas
control.
Mickey, hope this answers you questions.  If not call me.  

Let us know.

ds   713-853-4299

I had sent you an email in regards to pigging on the TW 24" Panhandle Lateral and the TW 12" Leedey Lateral. I haven't heard anything and wanted to make sure you are still the person that we need to visit with on getting these task resolved. If not, please let me know who we need to talk to.

The problem is we haven't ran a pig on these lines in years. In order to insure our pipeline integrity, we need to work through these obstacles and get something resolved. We know we have lots of liquid in these lines and need to proceed with pigging.

Please let me know what we need to do to get this accomplished.

Thanks,
Mickey

I added a tab "monthly" which accumlates the monthly imbalances per operator.  The accumulated monthly total balance would be the monthly oba imbalance net.

Would this be useful information until we develop the automated version.

give me a call if you have questions

no,  we are back to normal.

ds

Are we still working on Crawford???

DL

Please amend K#27579 Receipt Point from POI#500267 to POI#78169 for 20,000 mmbtu/day beginning 03/09/03 for the term of the contract.  After the March maintenance of the Crawford Lateral, TW will move the Receipt POI back to #500267.

Attached is the TW Weekly report for March 15, 2002.

 

Jan Moore
X53858

ID2:		The streak of non-variances ended tonight.  One variance was intentional, but the other was not.  In any case I had to
		manually schedule volumes at Transcolorado and Northwest for Sempra's CR 27848 and 27342, respectively due to 
		downstream confirmation cuts.
	
EVE:		All the points looked okay with the minor exception of Transcolorado.

OTHER:	The Force Majeure at Bisti looks like it will continue for 5 to 6 weeks.  Since San Juan will likely be cut every cycle,
		we need to allocate the NGPL points, Gray, Eddy, and Winkler even if San Juan does not appear on the original 			allocation list.  By allocating these points, the bogus volume at Northwest delivery will disappear, and then San Juan 		should come up for allocation.  I learned this the hard way by ignoring those points on the ID2 cycle for 3/15.  I knew 		the Enserco volumes were not going to be confirmed, but the delivery at Northwest over-inflated the deliveries at San 			Juan and should have been allocated.  The net effect was San Juan scheduled over 842,000 even though Darrell had 			the capacity at 800,000.

		For the good news, Joe Hoang recached our batch printer options so now the "J" printer at 3920 is usable.

See you later,  Bert

We are allocating approximately 90,000 to 100,000 mmbtu/d from San Juan.  After the conference call today, I will revise the posting.

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)

I just finished talking to Bill. He said that his brother Louis is not giving up and neither ae the doctors. Bill said that Louis can hear them talk to him and that he responds to feel, though Louis is still in critical condition. Bill said that the Lubbock Fire Department has been very supportive with food and beverages. I ask that your thoughts and prayers be with the " Jones" family and we will keep you all updated as time goes by. Bill also said that visitation to see Louis has been very limited.

ID2:		Had to manually schedule Northwest CR 20786/24954, PNM CR 20785/25397, and TW CR 22948 because the receipt 		points were considered invalid.  The system EPSQ'd all the volumes down to 50%.  I didn't have any problems with the 		Northwest or PNM contracts, but I had to trace the TW admin contract all the way down the West Texas and Central 		pools.  I was able to reinstate a lot of the gas, but Astra's ended up at Socal and part of Richardson's gas ended up at 		Socal and PG&E.  Sempra's went to Calpine, Reliant went to Southwest Gas Mojave, and USGT's went to both Rio 			Puerco 	and Westar Ward so I fixed their volumes.

		I had to manually fix Williams' CR 24925 and Texaco's CR 25923/25924 due to variances at El Paso Blanco and 			Mojave, respectively.  Williams was off by 1 MMBtu while Texaco netted to zero.  West of Thoreau scheduled to 			938,382 and San Juan at 772,209.  I confirmed the scheduled volumes with Gas Control for all the points involved.

EVE:		Had to manually schedule the Northwest and PNM Hub contracts again.  I did not touch the gas sales on the admin 			contract.  Hopefully it will schedule in the Non-Grid.  ANR is slightly off, and one Northwest Receipt changed by 1 on 		cycle 3.  The Northwest delivery from Milagro should schedule on the Non-Grid.  I submitted the volumes to WFS as if 		they did schedule on the Evening.

NON-GRID:	Confirmed down USGT's 27161 at Halley since NNG did not have a nomination in their system.  I got caught up trying 		to fix the Hub contracts that I did not notice the problem on the Evening cycle especially since Debra is working for 			the South end.  I nominated the payback volume on ANR's OBA for 15,000 on the 19th as well as the 20th through 			22nd.  I also confirmed the volumes for each day.  Check to make sure I am going in the right direction.  At least the 		system didn't get hung up during the confirmations like they did over the weekend.

If you need me on Tuesday, call me at home or page me.  I plan to work Wednesday night unless someone tells me otherwise.

I thought you might find this interesting.

Next, was a presentation by Staff on the California Update. Staff gave some interesting statistics: consumption grew 16% in 1995-2000 while capacity increased by 3%. In-state capacity will be insufficient to meet peak demand. Within the 2001-2006 new generation of 3200 MW will come on line in 2001; 6500 MW will be under construction and 15,000 MW has been either tabled or cancelled. Hydropower accounts for 20-40% and will play a significant role in the next five years. This places California at the mercy of snow pack conditions for up to 40% of its requirements. Last year the snow pack was 64% of typical and this year it is at 130%. Natural gas accounts for 15% of the state's needs; therefore, 85% is imported from outside the state. (47% from Southwest; 28% Canada and 10% from the Rocky Mountain pipes).Gas fired generation will decline in the next five years according to staff for three reasons:
new generation facilities coming on line
hydro will be at normal or above levels
neighboring states will sell into California
If there are surprises such as short-term price volatility, economic growth outpaces projects, low hydro conditions, energy conservation declines, California will experience similar conditions to last year.

FYI: See David's note below about payback. Let me know if I need to do anything for this payback to happen.

Tracy

 Hi all,

Attached is PPL's gas nomination for tomorrow. Please note we are requesting a
payback from the OBA on the TW lateral per discussion with Citizens and TW gas
control. Thanks

FYI,
To stay out of conflict with some big EL Paso outages on the San Juan Lat. in May, we need to look at dates after May 21. Just a heads up.

Jerry Graves 

Notes:
1) On Sunday the startup team changed their plans and did 2 ST Trip Tests
instead of tuning Duct Burners as planned.
2) Will do Duct Burner Tuning on Monday.  Expect MW swings.
3)  MW outputs are average values only in order to schedule overall gas
nomination for the 24 hour period.
4) Actual MW must be handled in real time.

Jerry and I will work with the Field teams and Tiny to see if late April might be an option.

Perhaps we should look at applying the drag reducer sooner.  With Bisti out of service, the drag reducer may give us some additional capacity.

What do you think?

Ben:  Please check and see if the DR application w/o Bisti gives us enough additional capacity to warrant an earlier application.

Thanks

This is when the E:mail was set and the set point was put out of the way.

Please leave the set point at 30,000 until further notice.

FYI, looks like 6 weeks.  I have communicated to Steve Harris.

We informed Ideal Electric this afternoon to start work on the Bisti replacement motor.  Josh Mayes has contacted Andrew Gagnon at Ideal with the P.O. information.  We were able to negotiate a three year warranty with the 6 week delivery.  Price will be $295,000 with a reduction in price of $30,000 to $35,000 if we can reuse the existing rotor and/or parts from the previously installed rotor.  We will need to ship the entire motor except for the top hat enclosure and the rotor at Roswell to Ideal.

Todd or Tiny, please ship the motor and spare rotor to Ideal Electric Company, 330 E. First Street, Mansfield, OH,  44902  Attn:  Andrew Gagnon, phone 419-522-3611.

Sarabeth or Josh,  please contact Ideal for a long term service contract.  Dan Pribble would like to know what this cost would be and he will decide if this option should be pursued.

Arnold, please send Andy at Ideal the information you have on the Gallup motor.  

Ideal is checking on the cost of a spare motor which would be good for both Bloomfield and Bisti.  Depending on what the Gallup specifications are, Ideal might be able to make the spare motor good for all three installations.  

We have informed Mark Knippa with ECS that due to the emergency situation that TW is leading the efforts to get Bisti back into service.  Mark will be in contact with us as to his negotiations with the Creditor's Committee on reimbursing TW for all costs.  I think Sarabeth will be our contact on these discussions?

I will be out of the office on Thursday and Friday.  Arnold Eisenstein will be available if any questions or concerns arise.  Thanks, Norm

IMPORTANT:  THE X.001796 BISTI ELECT. MOTOR REPAIRS NUMBER HAS BEEN "CANCELLED".  DO NOT TRY TO CHARGE INTO THIS NUMBER!!!!!!

A PAF has been routed for a C.03 Overhaul number for all charges to this project.  As soon as I get the C.03 number I will forward to all concerned for charges.

				Sorry about the confusion.		Thanks,  tj

Notes:  Bisti electric unit has been down since Thursday evening March 14.  TW posted a Force Majeure notice and began allocating
           San Juan Lateral on Friday, March 15, down from 880,000 to 780,000 mmbtu/d.   Preliminary estimate on down time is 4 to 6 weeks.
         

We are flying on one wing today.  CT #2 is not in service because of a
failure on a valve operator motor.

Testing will continue at reduced Plant output.  Expect load swings which
must be scheduled in real time.
An ST Trip Test is planned again for today, as well as some Duct Burner
tuning.

I don't know that for a fact.  I assumed since they do the same thing for the lamar power plant they should know to do the same
for Griffith and Calpine, that is why we send those daily schedules.

DS

Has this been explained to Keith once already? sj

They had a 35,000 order and Kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline.  They sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and
he didn't look at it.  I got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes 
for a 24 hr period.  Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that.  I will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain
how Griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline.

DS 

What was the problem? sj

We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.  
Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.  
If you have any more questions please call. 

Thanks DS  713-853-4299

BVZ has no schedule for valve repair or test program for Tuesday.

For purposes of gas nom, I'm showing base load on CT #1, chilled and
unfired.

I will be in a meeting with BP Amoco from 12 to 2.  Can we do this at 2 pm.

Thanks DS

A conference call to discuss possible pigging of the Bloomfield to Gallup line has been scheduled for:

1:00 p.m., CST, Wednesday, 09/19/01
877-795-3687

Talk to you then.

Ben my comment's below.

As the efficiencies of the lateral (between Bloomfield and Gallup) steadily decrease it is time to probably think about pigging that section again in time for the upcoming tariff season. We will be scheduling a meeting next week to talk about the following:
1)	When should we do this?
            Ben can your group figure what volume loses we are incurring as the percentage of efficiency goes down? After that we need to get marketing involved and 
            let them tell us when to pig the line and add new inhibitor. 
2)	Should we also consider surfactant cleaning?
            This will have to be looked at but only after running pigs to see what condition the pipeline is in. 
3)	It has been almost 6 months since the application of the DRA on that section. Should we re-apply?
            Again this is dependent on revenue loss compared to percentage loss and marketing will have to be involved.
4)	What are the costs-outages, cost of app
            This is dependent on what all we will be doing. If we add surfactant the cost will be quite a bit more. How many times do we run the pigs to get the line ready 	(we don't know this.) We'll need to work with Darrell Schoolcraft and marketing on outages. Cost of application we can get this from Nalco.
  5)	What are the benefits.
            Getting back to 7% increase in efficiency. 

           I'll be in a meeting in Oklahoma next week but will be available for a call.

Thanks
RJ

Please let John Sturn or myself know of when you cannot make a meeting next week.
Thanks

Check with Griffith this morning.

DS
Late this afternoon, BVZ requested a ST Trip Test.  We were unable to do it
because of WAPA system problems related to loss of internet communications.
WAPA requested that we stay at 225 MW until further notice.

Therefore, we have scheduled to do the ST Trip at 7:01 tomorrow morning,
Sept. 19.

Possible Outcomes:
1) Go from 225 MW to 150 MW starting at 7:01 and get back up to 225 MW
during HE 10:00
2) Go from 225 MW to 150 MW starting at 7:01 then go to zero if the CTG
runs back.

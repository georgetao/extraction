Chris,

Use this file instead.  Thanks.

Mat

Reagan,

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is 
listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we 
told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with 
Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  

Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had 
a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in 
the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung 
out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The 
broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, 
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and 
he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.

Mat

Dad told about you changing the ticket, but thanks.

Um, i look forward to hearing about this little accident (at least  i hope it 
was little).

yo yo

sorry i didn't write this sooner.  it sort of slipped my mind, i think 
because it went so smoothly.  so, yes, i changed the ticket and everything 
is all set.  i did have to put the $100 on my credit card, but don't worry 
about it.

later-

jonathan

ps i got in another car accident that i didn't cause but still got blamed 
for it.  but we'll get into another time.

waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!

and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky 
dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear 
this voice................."mat?".   I turn and the flight attendant is none 
other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i 
could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered, 
but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.

Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little 
dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's 
team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking 
my green beer.

About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking 
bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.

Later,
Mateo

Hey ya'll.....

Recovered from "Weekend Lobby" yet Matt?  Ouch!  Looking forward to hearing 
your reflections on a weekend well spent. Mark, how goes the two ladies you 
are presently juggling?  Thanks for blowing us off yet again!!  Anyway, 
wanted to plant a few seeds as far as social outings go....

1) The ski weekend in Burlington, Vermont:
   April (6-8th).  Plan on that

2) MARK: What are the chances with the corp condo in Colorado????
   Weekend of the 12-15 in April or the one following??

3) MATT: Jazz Fest?
   May (3-6)???

OK, well, that's about it boys!  Love, Kristen

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar 
pipeline.  Thanks.

Mat

Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary 
link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be 
called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm 
still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

Dear GEICO,

I have no idea who those people are that are identified in your email.  I 
would be interested in knowing how some random peoples' driving incidents are 
some how associated with me and my insurance application.  I have never had 
an insurance claim.  Please feel free to contact me with any further 
questions.

Mathew Smith

Dear Mr. Smith:

Thank you for your request for auto insurance.  Please provide the details
requested below to expedite the processing of your request.

We routinely run a claims history for all new policies and the following
claims were found.  Please provide details of each claim:

1.08-22-99  Gregoire B. Poyet-Smith  at fault accident

2.12-09-98  James A. Smith   at-fault accident

We will resume the processing of your request as soon as we receive the
details requested above.

Sincerely,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", 
with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Kern River plans to double their pipeline capacity by 2003. Please forward to 
others who may be interested. 

Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.

Chris,

Here are the additional manual entry meters.  Those highlighted in blue 
should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new 
records.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will 
leave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Mat

Yan,

Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we

I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.  

Mat

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

Mat

that bitch.  j/k.  thanks.

FYI
 
 No - I don't. 

Do you have a ticket for Matt?

Angela,

This file contains the historicals for Socal in the specified format.  Can 
you please dump them into the database.  Thanks.

Mat

Here are the headers:

1.  PIPELINE_ID
2.  EFFECTIVE_DTM
3.  DATA_REFERENCE_NUM
4.  FLOW_TYPE_CD
5.  MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_QTY
6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY
7.  AVAILABLE_CAPACITY_QTY
8.  PIPELINE_CYCLE_ID

These are the column headings needed for the historical data Excel files 
(they do not have to be in any particular order, but initially a template 
should be created, and then used throughout).  This format makes it a simple 
process to load this information into the database.

Thanks for all of your hard work!!

Chris

Angela,

Here are some more historicals for socal (I didn't realize we had these 
additional years).  They are in ADDITION to those already loaded.  Thanks.

Mat

Yan,

Please make the PGE daily report (#26) available on your website.  Thanks.

Mat

As discussed, the following file contains hisoricals for PGE.  Chris should

import anytime.  This data goes up to 2/6/01 and Chris will reload from 
2/7/01 to present.  Thanks.

I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Mat

Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate 
degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.

Mat

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you 
need more info.

David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
"Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.  

Mat

Hey, I'm going to give your resume to this girl, and I'll let you know when 
to follow up.

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link 
is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from 
Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the 
Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the 
page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Mat

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 
9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was 
out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an 
Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you 
think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that 
goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Mat

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
"unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.

Chris, 

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 
Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  

Mat

PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional 
PG&E point that we discussed last week.

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, 
it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key 
violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but 
do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key 
violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603

If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be 
great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Angela,

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with 
a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be 
loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D 
Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Well, thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because I was hanging 
out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.  I 
mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say 
about you.  Hope all is well.

Mat  

Imad,

Just wanted to let you know that I passed your resume on to the desk 
director.

Tuesday is good for me as far as I could tell.

ENRON ROCKS!

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=

continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=

seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20

? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=

of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

Don't get too excited to hear about the rest of the day...I don't have much

this group.  More later...

I will be attending the happy hour on Thursday.

Pedro,

I'd like to help, but to be honest, I don't know what LPG stands for.  Is LPG 
a commodity? Gas pipeline? Pooling point?  Let me know, and I'll see what I 
can do.

Mathew Smith

I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I 
would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot 
tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large 
(I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, 
and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending 
women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to 
take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.

With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,

Mateo.

Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente

OK

Thursday definitely no...friday maybe.  Also Dave Shank is in town to work 
with Marine this week.  You remember Dave don't you?

What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the 
City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some 
warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day 
this time...

Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work 
responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and 
I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.

Mat

Make sure you take care of Dave...  

Awesome dude!  I'll definitely be around.  Hey, maybe you can bring my wine 
(or the empty bottles which is probably more likely).

Mat

Yes, I'm scheduling for the West desk, so I need whatever software package is 
required.  Thanks.

Mi casa es su casa.  I've got plenty of room. 

Hey what's this I hear about you and Heather looking for a plot of land?

Pablo, 

Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not 
accessible before 7 am?  For your reference the error message is below.  

The address is http://www.1line.williams.com/webbi/ebb/main.

 

Error 500--Internal Server Error 
From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1:
10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error
The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from 
fulfilling the request.

Thanks.

Mat 

Everything went well, and you?  We are suppose to hear today!  I don't know 
what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.  Let me 
know when you do, and I'll do the same.  I'm sure we both did fine, since 
they didn't give us the technical tests.

I need descriptions of all the people on the mailing list that I don't 
already know.  

Any news yet?

huh?

I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole 
program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more 
candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing 
thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six 
people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing 
that they know and aren't offering any info.  

Cool.  I actually left a message with Ted, but obviously I've heard nothing.

Thanks.

Mark,

Did we not already do this?

Mat

Sorry for the no call.  I was busy until about 10 pm and....well I just got 
interupted.

Anyway, I'll call you later...ok?   I promise.  

Mat

Aah, thanks for the clarification.

Damn it!  What did I say?  Do you read your emails or what?  I want 
descriptions!  I want chicks.  I need a chick.  I need a really cool  chick 
to hang out with.

My response is that you need to call me tonight because email sucks.

Seriously, you better fucking call me.  Mark's away and I'm lonely.

no.

Hey, you still coming to H-town?

Hey, I, for some reason, just got your email.  Anyway,  I'll try to call you 
later in the morning, but if you want to call me at work my # is 
713-853-0472.  Talk to you soon.

Mat

I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to 
stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He 
also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst 
in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how 
this "track" will actually affect me.  

Happy hour tomorrow?  

Mat

Jeanie,

As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El 
Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more 
info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be 
interested.  

See you around,

Mat

Hey, are you there..............................?

It's funny, even the southern ones.  How was your night?  Please send e-mail 
to my compuserve account from now on (mds12403@cs.com).  Thanks.

Mat

Agghhh, it's so nice to get email from you.  I was thinking about old times.  
I can picture you right behind the cube wall in front of me and practically 
hear you yacking on the phone....or whispering to Jimmy....

Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to 
refresh it manually.  It sucks....

So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes 
you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be 
thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, 
so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.

Later.

Mat

Hey,  do you have instant messenger?  You're the type of person that would 
utilize it to its fullest potential.  Anyway, I have it, and I think you 
should so you can send me an instant message.

Helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.................................?

Well, will discuss that later.  Call me whenever you want.  Mat

Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email 
until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How 
about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a 
message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.

Donde estas?  Tu no me escuche!  Yo necesito te hablar.

Mat

Regan,

Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix 
right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after 
the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the 
buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place 
to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the 
role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time 
schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the 
traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets 
based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's 
just say my plate looks to be full.

By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.  
Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still 
some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For 
instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to 
the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw 
mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as 
well.  I'd like to know more. 

Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're 
spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this 
week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other 
people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  

Later,

Mat 

Sure, unless I'm on a flight.

Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed 
early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9.

So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what 
people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that 
the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, 
it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send 
me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole 
group on correspondance.

Mat

Leo,

Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of 
the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database 
structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a 
many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne 
and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities 
referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query 
facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order 
required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could 
develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment 
inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at 
least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, 
you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the 
table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as 
actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required 
for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  

I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be 
happy to with a little notice.  

Mat

Kristen,

How often do you check your cell phone and email for messages?

Mat

Tracy,

I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation 
beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the 
activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I 
should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and 
Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still 
attend these sessions.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

Kristen,

Just wanted to let you know that I didn't get any emails from you last night 
or today.  

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico 
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you 
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth 
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm 
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment 
than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there 
are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of 
holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently 
been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so 
my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the 
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help 
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae 
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some 
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in 
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a 
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, 
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just 
drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was 
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I 
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to 
hear what's happening on the island these days.  

Take care,

Mat

Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?  

Mathew Smith
3-0472

 

Hey, I just wanted to let you know that it's 7 pm Wednesday and I still have 
not received any emails from you regarding the ski trip.

Lunch on Friday sounds great.

Mat

Steve,

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - 
definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on 
tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would 
how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?  
Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later 
the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend 
if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't 
think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers 
are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702. 

Later dude.

  

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house
(as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is
that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract
is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When
are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The
diving is AWESOME!!!

month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different
environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico,
although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and
the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.
I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to
become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll
start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal,
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.
Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to
hear what's happening on the island these days.

Take care,

Mat

That is good to hear.  Give me a call today as you indicated.  

Mat
  

Hey cutie

It's all good.  I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny.  Bill
is in and he, Duncan and I are sending you the $308 asap.   I did not yet
hear back from Sharon but I have to assume she is in.  Also, Sandra
Lewis(GK's Sandra)  said she may be into the trip, just waiting to hear back
on that.

While everyone seemed to feel the 22nd-25th sounded fine they all expressed
interest in mid-march as well.  Did you find out when it might be availible
then???  I'll call you today for a final chat!
love, k

Hola, como estas? 

yo estoy malo. 

Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.

Matt, I'm sorry I have'nt done any testing.  I'm working this weekend so I'll 
give it a go.

Thanks.

Mat

That;'s funny.  I must have missed your call the other day.  Mark must not 
have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.  Regardless, 
I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.  You could 
also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.

Mat

Basically, you don't want to talk to me anymore :(  I just want to be 
loved....

Just kidding, I can't really respond right now, so I'll give you a call 
later.  I don't think I'm going to come now, so the time constraint is off. 

Mat

kathy.scully@milliman.com on 01/08/2001 02:20:41 PM
okay, i'm taking a break from trying to figure out this excel spreadsheet i'm 
working with.  it took me forever to remember how to use pivot tables.  it's 
pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts.

well, i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another 
media (i.e., speaking to you), but i guess you need to know asap, so i'll 
attempt it through email (even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts 
b/c there's always misunderstandings).  i guess the reason i'm very hesitant 
about you coming is b/c i don't know what you expect from the visit.  we both 
know things are obviously different b/w us more recently than they had been 
when you initially moved.  i'm not sure about the reasons you feel different 
about me, but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about 
you.  first, we don't really see each other often and that obviously makes 
someone feel less for a person, regardless of who it is (you have agreed with 
this).  second, since i started my job and have other things going on in my 
life, i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don't like being 
emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen.  so, i've tried to 
get rid of all my feelings for you.  also, i don't like limiting myself as if 
something will happen. i don't know about you, but regardless of how much we 
said we weren't anything and we were free to do what we want, there was still 
a limit on what we could do.  with us visiting each other (in more than a 
friendly way), i felt somewhat limited. by limited i mean i always felt i 
could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each 
other as more than just friends.  don't worry, there isn't anyone else, it's 
just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don't 
like (especially when i've realized it's hopeless to expect anything with 
us).  so, i guess the reason i'm nervous about your visit is b/c i think you 
would want it to be like our other visits (i.e., you stay over my place...in 
my bed...and we hang out together all weekend) where i don't think i want 
that.  i would like if you visited, but not how we usually visit.  those are 
my thoughts (although not clearly explained b/c of hte email thing).

let me know what you think...

You name the time and the place between 2:30 pm Friday January 12th through

OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING 
WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me 
this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your 
email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am 
planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the 
point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe 
you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to 
call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless 
since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

THIS IS A REMINDER TO RSVP TO CHERYL KUEHL VIA E-MAIL IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY 
DONE SO.

THANKS!

Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late 
when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided 
not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did 
you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you 
little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I 
bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were 
wondering.  

Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick 
ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading 
book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, 
and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was 
a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.

Have a nice day.

Mat

Hey, are you at work today? 

Did you have fun last night?

Are you busy?

I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I 
can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely 
want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam 
for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think 
we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you 
want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so 
inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later.

Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, 
although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of 
skiing!  

I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still 
available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I 
realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on 
the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, 
though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for 
NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.

Stay cool.

Mateo.

Who are you?

So tired I am.

Orangemen suck.  I hate Syracuse.  I'm no longer a fan.

Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Mat

i'm a dirty boy, a dirty, dirty boy

Karen,

I would be happy to attend lunch on Thursday.  Thanks.

Mat

Folks,

We are scheduling interviews for candidates for the ENA Trading Track on Thursday.   We have 10 external candidates interviewing and we would like your support to mix and mingle with them over an informal lunch at 12:45pm in Room EB42C.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Regards,

Karen

Marlo,

The name and number of the person to contact regarding the billing discrepancy for July 2001 is Mary Reid @ 213-244-3898.  Gasselect clearly shows only one trade for 43,559 mmbtu's from account 2527 to Z99.

Mat

Let's see...I worked a little on Sunday, but wasn't too motivated because of all of the turmoil at the company.  Weather was really nice, so Mark and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football.  Only thing is, the one game we wanted to watch, wasn't on.  At least there was plenty of beer.  Then we went home and grilled some steaks.  I like steak.  That's about it.  How about you?  Did you get all of your laundry done.  I didn't.

Mat

Hi,

How was the rest of your weekend?

I miss you,
Laurel

that's a really old one, but definitely one of my favorites.

You guys know I can't stand forwards but this is a hilarious vidio clip! 
Enjoy!  
Kristen

Thanks. So, I'm curious to know how the run went Saturday morning.  I was thinking about you guys while I was laying in my bed slightly hung over...

Matt,

Here are a couple of links that might be helpful for planning your ski trip. 
  Could you also please forward this email on to Ted.  I forgot to copy him 
on my email last time that gave my forwarding info and I don't recall his 
last name.  He is planning to be in park city with some friends this winter 
and wanted to get in touch w/ me.
Let me know if you have any questions regarding park city.  I think the 
parkcity info website has some info on Sundance, you just have to dig 
through there to find it.
Take care,
Mo

Sheila,

Socal injected 110,000 for thursday the 25th.

Mat

Hey Matt,

How's it going?

When you get a chance, would you mind sending me the updated Net Inj/WD activity for SoCal for Thursday (10/25)?

I also had a question on the injection for 10-18-01.  When I was updating everything for last week's report, our ops report at the time showed a 366,000 injection, but now it's back to 101,000...  Which is the correct number?  Any idea why it does that?

Thanks Matt!
Sheila

hey thanks...i'll be there.  just got back from Portland last night and am going through some FPP withdraw....

Hey, bro.  We're hitting the Front Porch for Happy Hour tonight if you're interested.  The way I figure it, you might as well drink some good beer while you're still employed.  PBR is just one credit downgrade away.

Later.

-M

I'm on the 3 pm flight today.  If you wanted to take me, I wouldn't say no, but, as always, don't feel like you have to...

Mat

Have you scheduled a flight?  Let me know what time.  I can probably drive
you to the airport on my lunch.

Steve,

Correction on that last email...WA Water Power (Avista) did submit the 714 form and is included in the PNW total.

Mat

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Mat

sorry, this is taking a while...

Hey,

What are you doing?  Have you taken  a lunch.  I already ate, but I need to
take a break.  Maybe we could rendezvous?  Let me know.

Since i'm logged in to this computer i can get mail, so if the phone
doesn't work, just send me a quick email...

Hope you're feeling better today, and that bitch doesn't give you any
shit!

mat

He Mat,

I just realized that I can't call your cell number from my work phone.
I
don't know if you are going to get this, but my work number is 503
219-8757.
Or, I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house.

Laurel

actually, i haven't eaten yet.  i'll call you in a minute.  i'm on a conference call right now.

Bart,

Yes, you should be able to pull the loads.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  there are several "scenario" runs of the model.  You should only use the "New Model" scenario which, I believe, is number 25.

Mat

thanks. i'll check with david w.

chris: just keeping you in the loop... matt let me know that we should be able to pull those loads now.

bart
If you want, you can have Dave Woodstrom do the query for you since he should now have access with that ID.

Bart,

Just wanted to let you know that I just had access to the west region forecast data granted for the "gasintranet" ID.  When I get back to Houston Friday, we can set up the query for you to use.

Mat

Hey, what up?  i'm still in Portland, in the office right now.  Had a prett=
y cool time this weekend.  Checked out Hood River, a little town on the Col=
umbia River Gorge and then headed up to Mt. Hood yesterday.  I think its ab=
out 11,000 ft high. There's a really old lodge half way up...it was almost =
snowing!  Actually, up near the summit you can ski year round....but i don'=
t think many people do.  The little trip made me think about our ski plans,=
 which we should definitely keep pursueing.  I apologize i'm a little out o=
f touch up here in Portland, maybe I'll do some surfing when i get a chance=
.  So, this chick fun...i don't really know what it is, but i feel comforta=
ble hanging out with her...I think maybe its just that she's pretty down to=
 earth.  She ski's a lot and plays soccer every week, so i guess there some=
 common interests there.  She's totally not into fancy expensive things...w=
hich is good because she's broke...want's to go back to school so she can t=
each.  Only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her...but i =
guess you can't have everything...
=20
Anyway, I took some pictures, so I'll send them to you sometime.  I have to=
 run.  Thanks for the email.=20
=20
Talk to you soon.
=20
Mat

Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, wher=
e
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking abou=
t
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k

socal injected 101,000 yesterday.  let me know if you need anything else.

Hey Matt,

Wassup?  How are things in Portland?  Do you think you might be able to provide me with the Socal injection number for yesterday from there?  

Thanks!  I really appreciate it!
Sheila

not too bad...i was late to work, though.  Fortunately...the day is over for me.  I'm leaving for the airport shortly. AND, i'm in a good mood because some the girl that him my car called and confessed!  She said she thought she hit a garbage can, but when she heard from the girl having the party that someone hit my car...she realized it was her.  Anyway, she called her insurance and it's all good now.

Well, I should get going now...

See you soon.

Mat

PS.  Sorry if i woke you last night.

How are you feeling this morning?

Mat,

Is this business or vacation?  I thought business but I want to make sure so I know how to put it on the calendar.

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to "unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.

your number is in my phone...can you call me?

I am sorry to keep bothering you, but what exactly does that mean.  I'm sure
you are busy, so this will be my last message.  Is there no availability at
the lodge, or are you unavailable.  You don't need to respond.  But at some
point before noon tomorrow, I will need to know your flight info.  

Keep it Real,
Laurel

no availability...

You still didn't answer my question.

Oouch!  

I continue to write to you, but you don't write back.  That's nice.
Anyways, I heard that Skamania lodge is a cool place to stay.  It is in
Washington, but just across the river from Hood River.  I don't know
what
you think about that.  If you want, I can contact them.  I'll wait to
hear
from you....

Hey,
 
I think I like to send an email to every that was at the party.  You wouldn't by any chance have a list of email addresses would you?

i think you have the wrong matt...

Hi Matt -

This is David's resume - the guy we talked about the other day on the
phone.  Thanks for your help and I hope you and your wife had a good time
at the cookoff!

Sara

(See attached file: David Wallace Resume.doc)

Joe said he found me in the morning face down on the couch in my clothes with the cat snuggling up with me.

that's amazing....i hit his door at least 10 times w/ Murphy's toy....i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too....

btw...shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke....i almost did, until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company...course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob.

you were doing a little nodding off yourself....that couch was a trap

get this......he didn't even wake up!  He had no idea that you were there and couldn't figure out how Murphy got out of his room.

i sustained injuries from friday night....two minor scratches on my index finger due to the cat, and a sore neck from head banging to limp bizkit....think mo suffered from the neck injury as well....hope your roomie wasn't irritated by the ruckus.

Mo,

Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  Hope to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.    

Mat

Susan and I are suffering from extreme neck pain this weekend from 
overenthusiastic dancing to "Nookie" at the Swan.  Just wanted to say thanks 
for hanging out, I really had a good time.  I didn't think I was going to 
get my second wind after dinner but I was pleasantly suprised.  I had a 
monster hangover on Saturday and did not get out of pj's until 4pm..it was 
pathetic.  But I had a great time and its only fitting that I get sloshed on 
my last day.  Take care and catch you sometime at the FP or Lil W.
Mo.

Bart,

Sorry I didn't get back to you right away.  Because I had my hard drive switched out last week, I have to reinstall SQL server on my computer.  However, because of the latest virus scare, they've taken away my administrator access to my machine.  This should all be taken care of this week.  Please check back with me, and I should be able to provide you with the load data.

Mat

Chris, 

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  

Mat

PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional PG&E point that we discussed last week.

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603

If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Ina,

Thanks for checking into it.  Coincidently, I noticed that there is a line on my phone called Portland #2 that noone uses.  If it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there?  Maybe it was used at one time or another, but just got forgotten.  Anyway, it's not a big deal to wait until we get into the new building.

Thanks.

Mat

This is what I am being told about the Portland/Houston direct line.

-Ina

Ina,

It's getting even more complicated.  I forgot that the Portland office is also going through major renovation and system upgrades that would also effect the possibility of installing such a circuit.  At this time, because of the uncertainty of what items are being changed, moved or upgraded at each location and when these events would occur, makes the reliability of this circuit a major issue and should not be attempted until both locations have completed their locations' projects.

Darren

Any luck yet on an answer?

-ina

Ina,

I would have to investigate further to determine if this can be done, however, at this time we are not accepting any new circuits for the Trading floors because of the pending moves to ECS.  Direct circuits using Enron facilities is difficult when equipment using the circuit is in ECS and the equipment establishing the circuit to Portland is in ECN.  There are potential reliability problems.

Let me do some checking.

Darren,

What would the cost be to se up a direct line between Portland and The West Gas Desk?  Are there any switches available for this where there would not be a cost?

Let me know what my options are.

-Ina Rangel

thanks.

That is as far as I got before I was put on this EES thing -- the rest of it exists in my head right now.  Sorry.  But the part you have should do a fair job of explaining the data issues.  I assume that in your visit here we will cover the information that ultimately will go into the other sections.

Steve,

Do you have part 3 and 4 of this document?  The last page we have has figure 6, but it looks like there was supposed to be further sections.

Mat

Hi Matt,

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.  Here is the document I promised that describes some of the steps I went through to collect and verify data.  I will give you a call to discuss.

 << File: DataDocumentation.doc >> 

right now, i'm leaning towards no, but my friend Kristen isn't being very cooperative about getting back to me.  thanks for keeping me apprised of the situation.

Let me know if you think you are going to go with us.  I have a college friend that may come up with a girl friend of hers.  Probably make room for them even if you do go but I just want to let her know.

Hope all is well
d

Aaron, this is Mike's latest sheet with all transporation path combinations included.  The files includes rates, receipt and delivery points, and live links to an EOL listen sheet.  It's basically everything you need to have an internet version developed.  Also, we do need an ops sheet modified.  Basically, we're trying to develop a net total for Keystone production.  More importantly, by the weekend we're going to need my Keytext Socal capture to work.  This is absolutely critical since we have a Nuke going out on Saturday and a major coal plant down.  Let me know if you have any issues.  Stop by sometime about the Keystone modification.

Mat

Hey,

You better do something about the crappy weather.  I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?  So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.  Don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me.  I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).  So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.  If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.  I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already! 

Hope you're staying warm and dry.

Mat 

Hi Mat,

It is raining and cold here today.  Hopefully, the weather will be good when
you come to visit.  Are you going to take that Friday off, or are you going
into work?  I might be able to take it off if you are.  Well, I am still
super busy at work, but am able to find the time to corresponde  with you.
I am excited that you are coming to visit and that we get to go on a field
trip, it will be fun.  I hope you are having a good day.

Miss You,
Laurel 

Hey, I think I lost your work number.  Can you send me it or give me a
call at work.

Mat

No, this woman that I work with informed me that in the beginning it was
the
goat.  Why she needed to share this with me I don't know.  What do goats
and
fraternities have to do with one another?  I am not familiar with the
goings
on of fraternities.  Did you have some sort of run in?  Do you need to
share?

goat?  i think that's only true for fraternity pledges.

What?  You didn't like that story.  You know it wasn't my idea, I was
coerced into the closet.  Ok, that doesn't sound very good.  I just
found
out that the goat was originally man's best friend.  Interesting eh?

No foreced drinking, just one ceremonial shot of tequilla.  I think
they're saving it up for this weekend.  I think we're having a party on
Saturday.  I don't know if we have any closet shelves that I can fit
into, though.....

Did people try and force glasses of alcohol on you just because it's
your
birthday?  That is always nice.  Sometimes it seems like other people
are
way more excited that it's your birthday than you are, and they just
really
want you to party.  I don't know, I am rambling.  I was up kind of late
and
so this morning I am a little slow.  

More like 50 cents.....Canadian that is.

Hi there,

How are you feeling?  Like a million dollars or more like .50 cents?

Hey, I got an error back because the files were too big.  I'll stick them in the dropbox in a folder called scheadul.

Mat

thanks

i knew you would say that.  i'll get as much as they have.

in general, we want all history available.  You never know when they're going to remove it.

 << File: gzn.ica >> let me know if this doesn't work.  i'm grabbing the last two months of data for them to input into the database.  let me know how far back you want and i'll try to grab it.

aaron

can you email me the gzn file.  My hard drive was replaced and I lost everything on my desktop.

Bart,

Until we can get the proper access, just come over when you need the loads and I'll create a file for you.

Thanks.

Since you set my security up for the fundamentals database, I can't access any of the outage tables.  Can you make sure that I have access to those tables with my NT id "msmith18".  Previously, I would use the "gasintranet" ID and "fundamentals" password.  Thanks.

Chris,

Hey, I noticed that we have two Portland lines on our boxes.  No one is around right now, but I'm wondering if it works, or if anyone ever uses it.  I just got a box, and I have the second line programmed in.  If you get a chance, why don't you see if it works on your end.  

Mat

Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

Zo,

What's up my brother?  Long time no speak.  I just got your email from Scotty P (somehow he found me).  Anyway,  I'd like to give you  a call sometime and catch up, so definitely send me your number.  I don't know if you knew, but I moved back to Houston again for a job with Enron.  I've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor.  Life is good, but nothing real exciting to report.  So, I just realized that next weekend is homecoming.  Any chance that anyone is going?  I wasn't planning on it, but if a bunch of people were going I could still get a cheap flight into Ithaca, but I'd have to buy it today.  If you wouldn't mind, send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going....

Well, since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it.

Hope all is well.

Mat

you've got most of them, i guess i probably just need to define the major ones for the high level screen...

Check out this list of the points we plan to put on the map and let me know if we should eliminate or add based on traders requests
 << File: Major Points with Pipeline.xls >> 

Jan,

Are you guys still planning on selling gas back?  

Mat

my canadian beer of choice is Labatt.

 
 

Hey,
Please send me Mat Smith's email.  I need to send him an email to get
him motivated to make the Whistler trip and I wanted to get his email
from you anyway.

I'll do a little more research on pricing.  For now tell him this:

Dates: arrive March 2nd and leave March 9th
Lodging:  $400 - $800 per person for 7 nights for 1 bdrm w/ kitchen,
walking dist. to lifts
Airfare:  $0 - $500 or so
Lift tickets:  $200-$250 for 6 tickets
Ground Trans.:  $60-$80 round trip from Vancouver to Whistler on shuttle

Food & drink:  ???, but the exchange rate is kicking ass at 1:1.55 and
the places we are looking at have a full kitchen with a fridge to hold
plenty of Molson

5000 ft of vertical and the best mountain base night life around, how
can you pass this up?

Later,

Brooks

Rent Revenge of the Nerds sometime.  And no, it's nothing personally related to me.  

Anyway, this day is pretty much shot.  The highlight was deciding where we were all going to sit in the new building.  We move in November 9th.  Should be pretty cool.  I just remembered, I'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with.  We're going to a martini bar before hand.  Oooof, I'm going to have to find a second wind.  Must leave soon......

Actually, I don't know the number yet.  Cell phone still the best.  Sorry, I haven't been available last night.  I was out.  Anyway, what's the news?

Mat

Hey there!

How was your birthday?  I wasn't able to get ahold of
you.  I feel badly because I wanted to wish you a
Happy one.  I hope that it was, and that you were able
to relax a little bit.

Do you know your new phone number?  I would like to
talk with you soon if you do.  I have news to tell
you!
Tis weekend is a long weekend.  I was originally
supposed to go to Boston, but Loretta and I changed
our minds.  I think she is moving into a new place
this weekend.

I hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Christine:)

To Whom This May Concern,

I have spoken to a couple people in your sales department regarding the shipping of this order.  Delivery was withheld because I specified a residential address.  In response, I would like to have the order delivered to the apartment offices at the delivery location.  The address should read Manor Way Office, but reference the specified apartment number.  Pete and Christy should be notified via the submitted phone number of the timing of the delivery.  If the offices are still considered "residential" you are authorized to bill me for the additional surcharge, which I understand to be not more than $30. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  713-853-047 (day)

Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

Nice.  I found grandmom to be very sexy.

Hi Mat,

Happy Birthday!  I hope this brings you much joy.  I know this is a little
demented, but it is sort of funny.  Since you don't know your address, this
is what I have to send you.  I hope you have a good day.

Love,
Laurel

Hey,

Nice to hear from you.  No, I haven't done much celebrating yet.  Just work work work.  Anyway, ya, I still want to come up sometime, it's just a little less inviting than it used to be.  When is a good time now?  I'm going to Portland in two weeks for a couple of days, but pretty much free after that.  By the way, my NEW address is 2125 Sul Ross Rd., Houston, TX 77098.  Anyway, let's chat sometime... Talk to you soon.
 

Mat

Hey Cutie,

Thought I would wish my boy a happy happy birthday!  Hope you had a great 
one!  Was up all night last night with a huge project proposal thing, kept 
meaning to set aside a few minutes to call you and do the b-day wishing 
then, but before I knew it it was 3am!!!!  So, what did you do to celebrate?

So this is the weekend you had thought about coming to Bean-Town.  Just  
wanted to check in and see what your plans were.........                  
Miss You,   K            ps-What is your address again?

Ina,

I still cannot access Sitara Reports.  After you last let me know it was taken care of, I do seem to remember it being accessible.  However, it definitely is not working currently.  

Mat

Hey Christine,

Everythings pretty normal around here.  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for the shirts.  I think they're great.

Mat

Hey there!

How are you doing?  How is work?  I am keeping very
busy here at school.  I know I am ready for a
vacation, how about you?  How is the new place?  I am
still trying to get organized- what a pain!!!!

I just wanted to say hi!  I'll be talking with you
soon!

Love- Christine

Do you know if you guys have started capturing the RT Final import flows from Oasis yet?

Mat

Come by and I'll show you where it is.

Matt,
dbo.MOD_Load table does not exist in the Fundamentals database on the Portland server. Any ideas?

Dave, 
	Since you've already gotten the connection built to portland could you created this for Matt?

Chris and Eddie,

I noticed that since Sept. 20, cycle 13 from NWPL has not been making it into the database, thus showing errors in our Ops report.  The Latest Scrape Information does not current show any errors in capture.  Can you please look into this and get back to me.  Thanks.

Mat

I have the Manual Entry process ready for testing again (testing as in testing by the analysts).  I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential "bugs" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.

Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).

Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:

"Previous" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just "Yesterday" as before)...
There is now an option to enter data for a "special cycle 0"...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of '0' is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).
You can now add "extra" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the "Previous" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.

NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I'm open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)

I have also fixed the "Exceptions Occurred" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.

Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to "beautify" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.

Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.

Thanks,
Chris

FYI, the portland website has a similar chart that allows you to double-click the bar and get the detail of the outages, as well as detail about the plant characteristics, so that you may be able to use some of their code.

Dave,

Since I'm thinking of it, what we'd like to strive for is, for one, to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges.  Also, it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range, respectively.  Maybe have the current page be the default with control boxes to modify the criteria.

Dave,

Hey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.  Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, Jason can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page.

IF-NTHWST/CANBR

This is sumas.   Also, you are correct, that all you need to do, is add this value to the others (nymex + basis + index).  Let me know if you need anything else.

Mat

Matt,
Thank you for the codes!  What are the correct calculations for the heatrates?  When determining the gas price, do I take the prices that I've been using and add the index value using the codes that you sent me?  Do you know the code for Sumas?

I don't remember exactly which locations you need the index curves for, but these should give you a start.  Let me know which ones, I've left out from your list.

Mat

Maria,

I think that the curve names are the same for index as for basis (which you currently pull), except that you specify the curve type as index instead of basis.  I've never looked in the database, so I've never seen the fields.  Hope this helps.

Actually, I'm not sure whether I want Gas Daily Index's or Physical Index's...Gas Daily preferably.  A list or the file you use would be great.  Thanks.

Mat

Sure I can have Carole give you a list, or show you the file we use to load the index curves.  I assume you mean physical index.

Anne,

Hey, do you know where i might get a list of the curve codes in the Oracle database for west index curves?

Mat

Maria,

Hey, I installed SQL server...I feel like a real professional now.  Although, I don't remember exactly which table I'm looking for.  I found one that's MOD_Load that looks like it's the one.  If it is, where do I find what the Scenario ID field means?  

By the way, I'm still working on those index curves.

Thanks.

Mat

Anne,

Hey, do you know where i might get a list of the curve codes in the Oracle database for west index curves?

Try these...

I'm still working on those other curves.

Hi Matt,
I need to pull some daily gas settlement prices from the Oracle database in Houston.  I'm looking for El-Paso San Juan, El-Paso Permian and Topock.  Do you know the codes those for those points?  
Thanks,

Matt,

You have exceeded your VaR limit.  Per the rules set by John Lavorato I will have to take $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  If you are still over your limit tomorrow morning, the penalty will be $1,000,000.

Kimat,

For your records, here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today.  I was out last week, but it appears that there was a trade around the 19th or 20th that i do not recall doing.  It looks like a buy of calendar 2003 of the Nymex for 5000 mmbtu per day.  I do not see this trade in my EOL transaction history.  Can you please look into this.  Thanks.

Mat

 

Ina,

A month or so ago, you requested access to sitara reports for me.  You said it was completed, but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out.  Can you please pass this on to the appropriate person.  Also, i still don't have access to TDS which we requested before last week.  Thanks.

Mat

 
I'll also drop off a copy of the population weighting.

Mat

Anytime you get a chance is fine.  Just let me know, but I'll tentatively plan on 3 pm.

Mat

Matt,
When you get a chance tomorrow, I want to show you some eol reports that I used to provide for the group.  Mike would like to have the fundies group provide this report for our group going forward.  My method is a bit inefficient..so I'm sure your group will be able to pull the data a lot easier; but, you'll be able to get the general idea from what I've done out of Access 97.
Anytime after 3 will be best for me since it is bid week.  Just let me know what works.
Thanks,
Mo.

great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Dean's is located on Main between Prairie and Preston.

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

Angela,

CIG (#42) is almost complete, but we have a few data changes to make:

First, for DRN 24906 Big Blue Meter Station, please replace the utilized capacity values of the records with effective date 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 with values below listed from 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 and delete records with effective date 4/21/01.  Also, please change all historicals from receipts to deliveries.

39014 	
39982 	
32987 	
44781 	
41381 	
41357 	
40586 	

Second, for DRN 16688 Keyes, Town of, please delete both the receipt and delivery records for effective data 4/21/01 and the receipt record for effective date 4/8/01.  

Thanks.

Mat

i feel a little awful...plus i'm tired.  I hope you weren't looking forward to speaking with a sober Mat yesterday.  i don't think i was that drunk, but who knows.  plus, i must be allergic to something because i can't stop sneezing.  oh, my life just sucks these days...j/k.  anyway, are you looking forward to tonight...especially with a nice full moon...make sure to look out for the goblins... 

Happy Halloween!

How are you feeling this morning?  I know you love email correspondence, so
you'll be sure to write back.

um, are you serious about the cat thing because now i'm a little disgusted...

yes, you were a little intoxicated when we spoke last night, but you were
sweet.  That is kind of creepy that it is a full moon on Halloween.  I need
to keep my cat inside because people steal cats on Halloween and skin them.
Well buck up little camper, in the scope of everything, things really aren't
that bad.  You could have to have life altering surgury.  Since this thing
with my family, it really has put a lot of things into perspective.  I hope
you feel better.  Call me later.

Love,
Laurel

hey, don't forget that report...Keith's bugging me.  thanks.

Sounds like a trick question...Obviously, you would take offence to me answering "no" for any reason at all.  However, I generally don't truly like people who I work with for whatever reason.  Though, if I answer "yes", it might imply that I don't like you now because you do not work at Enron, and somehow make you wish you did.  So....the answer is that it would be cool if someone i liked happened to work in close proximity (as long as it isn't too close), but who i like is regardless of employment.....

If i worked at your work, would you like me?

OK, I changed my mind...the answer is yes.

If i worked at your work, would you like me?

All I can say is that I'm not buying any....

Damn ENE is looking cheap.  Almost picked up a few shares at 12.5.  What do you think?  buy or wait?

Hi Matt,
I checked out the hydro data.  The Corps of Engineers changed the location of the files on their server, which is why our data is behind.  I've pointed our scraper to the new site, and the data is currently being imported into our database.

I don't recall needing any additional functionality from CQG.  In fact, I don't even use CQG.  Could you be referring to someone else.  

Mat

Scott,

I have your name listed as the contact for CQG (application). I have a gas trader, Matt Smith (msmith18), that would like to extract additional functionality out of the program, but it doesn't seem to be working correctly. If possible, can you please give me a contact name (if you aren't the appropriate resource) for the person in charge of functionality/training.

Please let me know if you can provide assistance.

If you aren't the contact for CQG, please send a reply and disregard this email.

Thanks!

Oh yes, it was a good contest.  Gannon is quite the quarterback.  Did you?  I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and went to bed.  Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.  It's only a matter of time before we shut the doors.  I think the only thing that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's everything with you?
 

Did you have some football-loving fun last night?

Keith,

Hey, is the plotter working, such that I could get a print out of that WSCC map you made for me a week or two ago.  Thanks.

Mat

you just want my address...2125 Sul Ross, Houston, TX, 77057....

I washed your sock.  Would you like me to send it to you?  If so, I need an
address.

well, i only got single prints...so i have to get copies or scan them or something...so it may take a bit..sorry.

About the sock, ya I'm short on socks...so it would be great if you sent it, but if not, don't worry about it.

For real, I have your sock.  I can keep it, if you don't want it, but it is
too big for me.  What ever happened to those pictures you were going to send
me?  Hmmmmm?

Chris,

I assumed we were scaping the "Inventory Chagne" point for PGE, but it doesn't look like any data is in the database.  Can you check on this.  It's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage.  The location name I believe is Inventory Chang.  If it's not being scaped, let's get it started.

Mat

nope

true...i think the dynegy equity investment is dead...i think the discussion are about a full take over.

You should think about getting all the Enron logoed stuff you can.  They'll
be great collector's items.

it, but if not, don't worry about it.

Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships

    NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the
embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer
and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of
its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by
U.S. regulators.
    Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan,
managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina
Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
    Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with
four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in
a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with
Enron.
   Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at
$9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Once those are set-up, Stephanie Sever will email you your new EOL id's.

Market Data

This is typical of the communication we are getting.  I received this at 3:30 pm...

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Good point.  Let's assign a D to it.

Mat

No sweat, I have just one question....is there a definable flow type for that (R, D, etc...)?

Thanks,
Chris

Moody's cuts Enron's ratings, may cut again

    NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
Investors Service on Friday said it cut its long-term and
short-term ratings for embattled energy trader Enron Corp.
<ENE.N> and warned it could cut the ratings again because of a
substantial loss of investor confidence.
    Moody's cut Enron's senior unsecured debt ratings to
"Baa3," its lowest investment grade, from "Baa2." It also cut
the company's commercial paper rating to "Not Prime" from
"Prime-2."
    If Moody's cut Enron's long-term rating again, it would
take it to a junk level. A downgrade would make it tougher for
Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business. The
downgrade also adds uncertainty to a potential merger with
rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N>, which has been in talks to acquire
Enron.
    Dynegy and Enron have asked for an expedited review of the
merger from Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
    Enron shares traded Friday on the New York Stock Exchange
down $1.15 at $7.25.

well, people are in better spirits now that the deal is done.  Too bad there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two companies.  at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job.  so now i just need to decide whether i want to keep it.  there's going to be some opportunities elsewhere as people leave Enron and join other companies.  How's Kate doing?  are they worried?  there probably aren't a ton of other trading shops in Portand.  At least there are a bunch of other shops in Houston for people who get screwed from this deal...

I heard the news.  How are you doing?  

Kam,

I received my eol id, and went ahead and executed a few trades.  I'm now trying to get into TDS to views positions and such, but it doesn't look like it is set up.  I can get into TDS but there aren't any selections in the Desks dropdown box.  The tds login i used was msmith_pc.  Is this something you set up?

Mat

Kam,

Now I tried msmith18_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select, but nothing else.

Mat

Motorcross...white trashyness...sounds like fun.  i think i'm going to go home and pass out.  i'm so fucking tired.  went to the Dynegy bar last night and i think i had a few too many beers.  only thing is my roommates gone for the weekend so i'll probably get a little lonely.  oh well...i hope there's some good tv on.  sure wish i had some motorcross to attend!

Mat

I am glad to hear that you're not freaking out.  As for Kate, she is pretty
much ambiguous to the whole thing.  She doesn't have and money invested in
Enron, so if she looses her job she won't be that sad.  I talked to her last
night and she seemed not to care one way or the other.  She said that
yesterday the traders were freaking out and most of them left the office for
"lunch" and didn't come back.  So, you aren't sure what you're going to do?
At least you have options.  Kate and I are going to see some motorcross
tonight and have some white-trash loving fun.  It should be interesting
people watching.  Kate said she going to find herself a mullet.  Any big
plans this weekend? 

well, people are in better spirits now that the deal is done.  Too bad
there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two
companies.  at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job.  so now i

Matt,

You're positions will not show up tonight until we "load" them.  This will be done once your P&L is calculated for the night.  After tonight, your trades will hit immediately after they are executed.

Please call with any questions.

Kam,

It appears my TDS is linked to Keith's book and not mine.  I don't mind having access to his position, and i actually will probably want it, but the book names probably got confused since his is WT and mine is WC.

Mat

Matt,

You're positions will not show up tonight until we "load" them.  This will be done once your P&L is calculated for the night.  After tonight, your trades will hit immediately after they are executed.

Please call with any questions.

Kam,

Now I tried msmith18_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select, but nothing else.

Mat

Thanks.

Matt,

There was a problem with your book on Friday night.  The IT group did not have it ready to calculate so I was unable to report it.  They will have this done today and I will then load your positions into TDS.  As of Friday you were short 30 NYMEX contracts in Dec-01.

Sorry for the delay.

Kam,

Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.

Mat

thanks.

Manual Entry is fixed

Steve,

As I remember the output from your power forecasting model gets stored in the MOD_Load table.  However, that table does not appear have results for California for the scenario ID 25 (New Model).  Does the California data have a different scenario ID?

Mat

FYI, Northwest is having that airfare sale again.  Houston to White Plains...120 bucks...

you buy a place or are you still renting?  I can't imagine that the company will go totally bust.  got any trips out east planned?
ever work out a ski trip?

it's a little iffy right now...
i'm planning for not having one, although i'll in the one place that the company is trying to preserve.

you going to have a job when this is all over?  

well...here we are.  i'm still not buying.

Word....when will it be a good buy? 8 ??

told you so...

Damn ENE is looking cheap.  Almost picked up a few shares at 12.5.  What do you think?  buy or wait?

hey, that airfare between boston and houston of 120 bucks is now available between rochester and houston.

Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my 
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, where 
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a 
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as 
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent 
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I 
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on 
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best 
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and 
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in 
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about 
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k

Just wanted to let you know that noone has come by to setup my Kobra. 

Mat

Shouldn't be a problem.  I'll get it done.

Do you have a problem doing this?  We would just change the description  at  Socal KRS to inlcude this point.
Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the "NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as "Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

Pat Mulhern

Chris,

The last I left it with Chris and Dave W. was that I was going to compile a list of exactly what data we needed and I will include all the items you indicated.  I do have time this week, but not much because it's bid week.

Mat

Jason (et al):

We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.  We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to "prime the pump" are:

1)  What are the requisite sites involved?  (URLs, etc)
2)  What is the frequency of "jobs"?  (how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).
3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?  (this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)

These are just some topics to get us started...you may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forward.

Please reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.

Thanks,
Chris

Jody,

I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.

Mat

 

Yan,

As discussed, it is acceptable to rerun the cube at 6:30 am.  After the the refresh, the following West reports should be generated:  #25 CIG_WIC (daily), #40 Rockies Production (daily), and #9 Socal (daily, historical, merge).  Also, please generate the west flow summary report at 6:15 am.  In addition, #22 West_2 (daily and historical) and #38 West_3 (daily and historical) which run before the 2nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 1st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by Patti (roughly 5:30am).  Let me know if you have any questions.

Mat

Chris,

I stumbled across a few problems with CIG/WIC.  First, location 2776 for pipeline has historicals loaded with flow type "D" yet new data is scraped with flow type "T".  Let's change all D's to T's.  Where dates overlap (key violations), just leave the existing Ts and scrap the Ds.  Second, please move the usage data for 279577 with pipeline number 6 to the same DRN with pipeline number 43 and delete the location under pipeline 6, as this is a manually entered point.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat

Chris,

I think we need a new pipeline for El Paso Manual Entry.  We need to enter linepack once a day.  Let's call the DRN LinePack and populate with flow type S.  Thanks.

Mat

Chris,

More changes............

For DRN 34585, please change the utilization value in the usage table for 4/23/01 to zero.  Then change the DRN on all of the usage data for 34585 to 34584 and delete location 34585.  In addition, please make the following utilization value changes to the usage data for DRN 34584:

4/2/01		28954

Remember way back when......we threw out a bunch of PGE (#17) data that we were going to reload from the saved html files?  Anyway, it looks like we're missing data from 2/7/01 through 3/12/01.  As we discussed, we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database?  Let me know if there are any issues.

Mat

 

Ashley,

There's a changed deal in my book with Counterparty City of Pasadena.  I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book, which is the correct book.  It appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake.  ??

O:ECT/West/Fumndamentals/Demand/Regressions
R: Webcontent/gastrade/west_desk/power database

Let me know.

Thanks
Ina

The value should be 0 for R (the value moved from DRN 30685 which should have been changed to zero) and 30685 for D.  All the values were D's consistent with the existing data for DRN 30684 for those days prior to moving the R values over (which should be zeros for those days).

Mat

on the 23rd, should the value be 0 or 30685?  also, what flow type do these numbers correspond to?

thanks,

I'm sorry I do not know what this is in regard to.  Could you have meant to send it to another Mat Smith?

Customer has rang as she has had no correspondence about thisquery. I see that you closed it on the 16 March 2001. Can you please send her a letter with the result of your investigation. 
Many Thanks Charline

Colin,

Great.  As we discussed, we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day (dates listed as column headings) of the current month.  Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.  I understand that we do not yet have permission from EOL to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task.  I'm available today to help any way I can.  Thanks.

Mat

Matt, I think I cracked the query to give a counterparty based position of the SoCal product you requested. Can you (or Mike) varify the following numbers (COB 04/27/2001) ? I was unable at this point to net the volumes in one sweep .....

I am waiting for a response to an email I sent 1 month ago regarding your
database of facilities used to generate the daily plant outage list.  I
would like to cross reference the outage information you provide with other
data from other sources and would like an efficient way to "join" the data.
It would be helpful to me if I had a table of plants showing your text name
and a unique ISO or WSCC identifying code.  I can be reached at 713-853-0472
for any questions regarding this request.  Thank you.

Dave,

As discussed, I need to have daily power outages summarized by Natural Gas (NG) type plants and everything but NG for each WSCC region for the previous year and one year into the future.  The historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority.  Initially, I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts.  We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).  Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.  If we can't get it done relatively quickly (say by wednesday), we might have to try a different route.  Thanks.

Mat

Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages (portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Mat

Tim,

Colin and I spent a few minutes on the phone with Bob regarding the outage information we were trying to get.  With Bob's help and with the use of your stored procedure we saved a bunch of time.  Thanks for your help.

Mat

Colin,

Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....

Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called "PlantOutage".  Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.  

Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.

Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.

Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.  

Thanks for your help.

Mat

 

Amanda, 

Can you please add a link to Gas Fundy under the Testing tab called "West Cash Trades".   The file is called WestCashTrades.htm.  The description is, "Daily cash trade volumes by counterparty for West region locations."  Thanks.

I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Chris,

Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.

Background

The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.

Task

Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).

Timeline

This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.

Amanda,

Please add a new link under the the Power tab in the Plant Outages folder called WSCC Interactive (Portland).  The file is in the California directory within the Power directory.  It is called pge_Portland_data.htm.  Thanks.

Mat

Chris,

For the following dates, we do not have Cycle 7 data in the database for PG&E (Pipeline #17).  These should have been reloaded from the saved html files.  Do we have these files, and if so, can you load the appropriate dates, in order the get the Cycle 7 data in for these points.

2/8/01
3/7/01	
3/8/01	
3/9/01	
3/10/01	
3/11/01	
3/12/01	

For the following dates, the data we have for Cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains.  We need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct, and if it isn't, get it corrected.  I could check them, if you could print out the saved pages for me.	

2/12/01
2/27/01 
3/1/01 
4/11/01 	
4/16/01 	
4/17/01 	
4/18/01

For both of these, the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 7.

Mat

As I was discussing with Duncan, I'm coming home Wednesday night and coming back to Houston on Monday late afternoon.  During some portion of the holiday, I'll be up at the islands, but i'm free to hang out for a day or so.  Are you around Thursday? Where would you go rafting anyway?  I'm definitely looking forward to the holiday, though.  A little barbaque, a little beer, a little boating, a little fishing, a little beer, a little golfing...I guess I should have taken the whole week off.  Anyway, give me a call sometime, and I'll try you when I get chance.  

Talk to you soon.

Mateo

Any great plans for the long weekend?  Duncan and I are looking into some
white water rafting water oriented types of things....though I know there
will be know swimming this early in the spring.....brrr!

love, k

Jerry,

I requested some questar flow historicals from you per the following email.  I am still in need of the referenced data, and would appreciate an indication of when it will be provided.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at the number below.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

The following are action items for the historical sheets I checked, including those assigned to Catalina:

Socal - Replace data for April 26th, insert data for Dec 16th, 17th 1998.
PGE - Load line pack (if available) historicals, complete changes identified in email to Chris H., add/load storage balances.
Questar - Replace historicals from 12-9-00 to 2-6-01.
El Paso - Reload...
KN - No action items.
San Juan Plants - No action items.
Fix calculation of null values.

Mat

Tara,

It looks to me like the following dates are missing for CIG/WIC

CIG 	- 5/2/01
	- 4/9/01 - 4/20/01

WIC	- 5/2/01
	- 4/7/01 - 4/22/01

Date ranges are inclusive.

Mat

Just wanted to let you know that i'm having some flowers delivered to the house tomorrow (Sat) for Mother's day.  They couldn't give me a time, though.  I told them to leave them on the porch if noone is home.

Also, I just got invited to play golf at TPC, which if you don't know, is the venue for the Houston Shell Open.  A round costs at least $100, but free for me.  I better get to the range tomorrow.  Unfortunately every muscle in my body aches from working out and today we did arms, so i'm really in trouble.  Oh well.....

Talk to you soon.

Mat

Charles,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.

Mat

 

One more thing, we have no way of knowing what gas was bought at index vs. daily.

Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.

Mat

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you need more info.

sick of emails yet.............the last line in the table is not SWG, please ignore.

Thanks for the info!

Tara,

It appears that from December 1999 back (although I haven't checked everything), Kern historicals were loaded improperly (wrong column from the website).  So, another major action item will be to reload those actuals.

Mat

Eliminating the effect NULL values have on MDX AVG's in History is progressing but has been filled with additional problems.

The solution to divide the sum from the cube by the count of nonnull days from SQL is practically done. In addition to 
all day Friday.  Five hours were put in over the weekend.  Much of this time has been spent resolving the underlying problems
that pose a problem to consistiency of results..

Done:
Develop query -- spRPT_GetAllDaysWithData
Parameterize query
Modify Program structure to call query with necessary parameters
Determine most complete cycle to use (Get cycle with most number of days of data) 
Verify Queries -- Started

To Do:
Determine how to use all retrieved cycles in NonNullDaysCount query.
Prove this approach is workable. 

  

hey, haven't read this yet, will try today.

Matt,
 
Long time no  hear, hope you're doing fine at the new company. Sorry to bother you  with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you  already, so I'll be brief and to the point. 
 
We have been  trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the  client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with  programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and  to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to  copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data.  Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database  read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and  we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database.  
 
The problem is  that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled.  Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance,  operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the  read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and  found the following string on all four buttons:
 
DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acRecordsMenu,  acSaveRecord, , acMenuVer70
 
I temporarily  deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not  had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do  not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather  find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is  not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered  right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority  anymore so if its something that will consume  a extended period of time,  let me know and I will continue seraching through other  channels.
 
I guess this  wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be  emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for  you.

Juan Carlos,

The line you deleted simply saves the current record.  Deleting it will not cause any problems in a read-only database.  In the regular working version, deleting may result in edits to a record not being saved.

Chris,

I recently found out that Questar posts a Clay Basin storage inventory in html on their website.  The link is http://www.questarpipeline.com/html/qpc_capacity.html.  We will need to start scraping this balance, specifically the "Total Clay Basin Annual Working Gas" and "Total clay Basin Reservoir Inventory".  This does not impact the storage Inventory issue that we've previously discussed, since this balance is currently a manual entry point, and will continue to be even after we start scraping these points.  Please give me a realistic estimate of when we can begin scraping this data.  We will need to create DRN's for both of these points.  Clearly, in terms of priorities, working out the bigger storage inventory balance issue is much higher priority.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Could you please send them a copy or re-issue a new letter.

Thanks!

I'll be home Wednesday night and I fly out Monday afternoon, but I don't really know which days I'll be up at the 1000 islands.  Depending on when I go up to the 1000 islands, I'll probably come back from the 1000 islands on Sunday in time for a little boating and binge drinking.  Would it be a good idea to plan a barbaque or something for Sunday?  Monday doesn't work for me because I'm flying back.  Jeff will be around in case you didn't know.  Anyway, I'll be in touch.

Mateo

Hey baby,
Well, as per usual, the plans are getting all botched.  Why can't people
just commit to a plan and roll with it?  Bill is now going to Disney...what
the f is that all about?  After checking into some new ideas (different
rental properties located near water) we quickly determined that that option
is near impossible at this late date.....	So, now we are trying a few last
ideas and have determined that most likely we will probably just have to
settle for chilling at the point, using Mom and Don's boat and tying up at
the sandbar with Kelly and Mike and their boat, bbq, beer and oh yea, lot's
of beer.  Come to think of it, that sounds great.  I think a few of my
girlfriends from Roch may join us as well.  Should be good!  So what does
your itinerary look likle?   love, k

Matt,
   It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a rele=
ase capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide=
 daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effec=
tive if you would like.

Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers =
on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical dat=
a on all or most points on the pipeline.

Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeli=
ne.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward=
.  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data po=
sted on the web site

Becky,

I recently requested historical flow information from Questar pipeline.  In=
 their response they indicated that they will only provide flows for the on=
e or two locations for which Enron has capacity allocations.  Chris Gaskill=
 indicated that you would be able to comment on whether this is consistent =
with the FERC 637 reporting requirements.  We wish to aquire historical flo=
ws for all metered points currently reported daily on Questars website (onl=
y 30 days history is available on their system) from June 1, 2000 to March =
1, 2001.  I have attached my original request and Questar's response.  Feel=
 free to call with questions (3-0472).  Thank you in advance.

Mathew Smith

Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) qu=
antities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided fl=
ows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1=
, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the po=
stal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel=
 free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

Matt,
   It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a rele=
ase capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide=
 daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effec=
tive if you would like.

Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers =
on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical dat=
a on all or most points on the pipeline.

Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeli=
ne.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward=
.  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data po=
sted on the web site

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:

Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

Mat

um, I don't really know.  I did a search for "VB6" and did find one file.  When you get a chance, can you make the long journey across the isle to take a look.  Thanks.

Mat

Mat,

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Thanks,

Ronggen

Thanks Chris.  According to Patti, Williams was doing maintenance to its site and did not come back up.  When, the site becomes available lets plan on rerunning the capture to get the last cycles for the missed days.

Mat

We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturday
evening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time to
be able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took a
look and the following cycles did not get scraped:

05/19/2001
Kern, Cycles 2 & 4
Transco Cycle 2

05/20/2001
KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Kern, Cycle 3
Northwest, Cycle 6

I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately, I suspect there is data loss
for the above cycles. One of our "old friends", the 1line Williams site, is
definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This site
still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next
couple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,
and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked
(this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data
from as well).

As I write this, "capture" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing
due to "Internal Server Errors".

Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize
soon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactly
what it was supposed to do when these problems occur...it retried until the
job attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.

Chris

Amanda,

Please move the link for the West Ops reports from Testing to Pipeline\West and also add an additional link under Desk\West.  The location of the actual files should remain unchanged.  Thanks.

Mat

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Mat

 

Steve, 

Exchange wouldn't send the email because the file was too big.  I put it in the Dropbox, though.  The file is called West Region map.ppt.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Mat

Karen,

My current rotation information is as follows:

	Current Rotation:	Gas Fundamentals
	Supervisor Name: 	Chris Gaskill
	
	Thanks.  Mat.

All,

I would be grateful if you could please confrim your rotation data by return (this is to ensure or HR systems reflect your current rotation).  Pls confirm by end of day today.

Current Rotation:
Supervisor Name: 

Thanks, Karen.

Chris,

The attached file contains Kern data for 4th cycle 19th through the 21st and cycle 2 for the 21st.

 
Thanks.

Mat

 try this.

Becky,

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze 

Mat

Exactly.  Her extension is 3-5276.  Thanks.

Mat

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Angela,

Please delete all data for PGT (pipeline 15) with effective date less than 12/1/00, and then load the attached file with historicals with effective dates from 1996 through November 30, 2000.  Please let me know if you have any problems.  Thanks.

Mat

 

I need to have an Outlook public calendar folder created to track maintenance shedules on West Region pipelines for the West Gas Trading Desk.  Patti Sullivan (psulliv) and I (msmith18) would need administrative rights.  Can you please direct me to the appropriate people to have this set up.  I can be reached at 3-0472.  Thanks.

I am no longer looking for assitance in finding an apartment, but thank you for your attempts at contacting me.

Becky,

Have you heard anything yet from Questar?  Now we also need data for May 24 through June 1st because their site did not report all week.  Should I give Lori a call again?

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Becky,

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze 

Mat

Thanks.

Matt:	I just called her back and she said she talked to her supervisor right after I talked to her the first time, and her supervisor has not gotten back to her on it.  She is going to try to get hold of him right now, and she will call me back.  I'll follow up tomorrow.  (But feel free to call me if you haven't heard anything from me in a couple of days!!)

Phil,

How's this for starters...

 

The San Juan plant receipts and Rockies production information should be accurate.  The third tab, Keystone Receipts, is definitely not comprehensive.  That information is for El Paso Natural Gas only, and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values.  Unfortunately, a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for.  I'll see if I can get together at least some TW and Northern numbers for the Perm and that might be as good as we can get.  

Mat

Eddie,

We'll need a new pipeline for Northwest manual entry.  The point should have DRN JPINV, but no corresponding IHS DRN.  Please populate the database with a value of 16,460,301 with flow type S for 6/2/2001.  We will manually enter this point until we can automate it.

Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

Mat

Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a month
ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and I'll
be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my layover is
for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out of
Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll call
your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch the
earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I see
each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at the
beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.

Bill,

Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.  Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).   I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).  I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.  I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.  Holden is aware of these problems.

THERE WERE SOME ISO CUTS AND ISSUES YESTERDAY:

HE19: 
EPMI_CISO_DUCKS @MALIN. 
CUT THE SCHEDULE FROM 219MW TO 169MW.

HE23:
FLOWED 75MW FROM MALIN TO PALO VERDE. THERE ARE NO FINALS FOR THIS SCHEDULE. THE REASON WAS THAT WE WERE FIRST AWARDED 75MW CONG RELIEF. THEY THEN REPOSTED FINALS WITHOUT TELLING US. WE FOUND OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUR THAT THE 75MW SHOULD NOT BE IN THERE. INSTEAD OF CUTTING THE SCHEDULE AND PISSING OFF EVERYBODY I HAD BARRY AT THE ISO PUT IN THE SCHEDULE. WE ARE NOT GETTING CONG RELIEF BUT THE SCHEDULE DID FLOW.

Hey Guys.

The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels. 

Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.

An excerpt:
Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's headquarters in Houston. 
According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up. 
"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change." 

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment 
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers <mailto:cberthelsen@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, May 20, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/20/MN121438.DTL>
Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy industry workers. 
Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 
The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times as much as a year ago. 
Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. 
But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed to the plants' deteriorating condition. 
"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units up." 
Unusual phone calls 
Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's headquarters in Houston. 
According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up. 
"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change." 
The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 
"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 
Corporate denial 
Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 
While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 
"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within an hour." 
Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first. 
The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 
Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business practices laws. 
Invisible practice 
How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 
One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators. 
When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required. 
The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, the output was back at the expected level. 
Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 
The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more aggressive than others. 
"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would go up. 
"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 'Bring it down again.' " 
Rapid changes 
These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which also reduced wear and tear. 
"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on the units." 
ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power. 
But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices. 
A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies. 
Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity from all sources. 
Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. (278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 
Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 
Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 
accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures. 
Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 
But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem. 
Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance. 
Ramping may be rampant 
Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in Minneapolis, he said. 
Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 
In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the "major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 
One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met. 
On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 
"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

Hey Guys. 

We have a new way to export from NP15 up to the Northwest. Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border. There is currently 30MW Non-Firm Hourly transmission available on the tie.

The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie,  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site. Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS/ Offerings. The path name you need to check is W/PPW/CRAG-PACW//. Make sure you pick Hourly non-firm. 

On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCAD_1_CRAGVW by the CISO. 

Procedure:
Export at Cascade from the CISO. 
Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System. 

Transmission costthrough PAC is only $5.84.

I know the NP15/MIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past. It does on the other hand give us another option.

Hey Guys. 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. 

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.

NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

If you guys have any questions  just ask me.

HEY GUYS!

We got some supplemental bids awarded Friday and Saturday monring and as you know CAPS does not deal very well with sup's. 

FRIDAY:
EPMI_CISO_MEAD

HE3: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230,
HE4: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230.

STAURDAY:
EPMI_CISO_MEAD

HE2: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230,
HE3: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230,
HE4: -75 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230.
HE5: -100 DEC SUP AWARDED AT MEAD230.

EPMI_CISO_SOUTH

HE3: -50 DEC SUP AWARDED AT PALO VERDE.

I HAVE ENTERED THE DEALS IN CAPS BUT THEY ARE NOT IN THEIR AS AWARDED AS IT DOES NOT WORK.

GEIR

The ISO cut the one side of my wheel on HE24 on 4/13. 

I had a firm export at 4C (EPMI_CISO_BUNNY)  of 20 mw for a sale to powerex and a wheel EPMI_CISO_ TOBY at PALO going out at Silverpeak. 
They cut the sale to POWEREX and the following imports. They cut the following:

EPMI_CISO_BUNNY 20 to a 8
EPMI_CISO_TOBY IMPORT 12 to 4. 

All this while keeping my EPMI_CISO_TOBY Export at a 12. 

Basically they used both the WHEEL IMPORT/ FIRM IMPORT to Fill the WHEEL EXPORT.

Geir 

Hey Guys. 

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. ($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra.

Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

Account numbers:
SPP - PAC: 853724
SPP-SNOHO: 853703
SPP-PUGET: 853725

Of the 45,000 we sold 22,000 was not able to get scheduled by the timely
nom.  With problems at Kemmerer, this volume is vulnerable to cuts.  Any
more thought on how this problem can be resolved?

brandon, just looked at your email. I'll check into interns.

I just sent the support for the volume cuts.  I also spoke with my trader
and she called Steve South at your company.  Steve confirmed that the price
for the 6th - 31st was Malin gas daily.
Let me know if there is anything else you need.
Thanks,
Hilary

the deal was in fact gas daily + .05 

I plan on calling my all-- star selections tonight but I'm not sure what to 
tell them as far as practices are concerned.

also: do the Packers still get 8 plus 1 alternate?

Ruth,
Call me if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Theresa

 

Ruth,
Here is an estimated November purchase.  Crestone won't have final measurement until next week.

Call me if you have any questions.

Theresa
 

Megan,

Congratulations on your new job!  I certainly understand you leaving.  I really enjoyed working with you and I'll hate to see you go (At least before the rest of us get let go).

Amy was let go last Friday here along with another guy.  It's only Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself left.

I am working on the November producers today as a matter of fact.  I am hoping to complete them today or tomorrow morning.

I have a walk through on my new house tomorrow afternoon and could possibly be moving on Monday or Tuesday, otherwise it'll be next Thursday.  I wanted to get all of this out of the way before my move.

I'll get busy now and hopefully email you later today.

Thanks,
Theresa

Theresa/Amy:
I just wanted to let you know that I have given two weeks notice.  I need a little more stability in my work environment.  My last day at Enron will be 12/26 and I'm taking a vacation day on 12/21.  I'm telling you this because I want to be able to complete the November Powder River and Lost Creek deals before I go.  I know we probably won't be paying anybody, but at least they will be reflected correctly in the system.  It would be great if I could have the files by the 18th or 19th.

Also,  please look at Howell for Oct 2001.  I see some volume reversing in the system.

I hope everything worked out Okay with your rent.

Megan

The only thing I'd like to add is the Quantum purchase for November is 1,000 Mcf not MMBtu.  We are showing a 967 btu factor so it would be 967 MMBtu at the wellhead less fuel.

Any additional gas would be under imbalance between Crestone and Quantum.

Thanks.
Theresa

Scott & Walt:

A couple of things...I talked to Theresa today and the OBA Spreadsheet (or actually,  Enron's imbalance sheet) needs to be changed for both October and November as follows:

October:

ENA purchased 300 mmbtu/d from Westport  at the Bear Paw point beginning October 9.  We need to add a column on the ENA sheet (i.e. similar to Phillips) showing that 300 mmbtu.
Quantum - ENA did not purchase any gas from Quantum for October.  We had some measurement of gas from Quantum throughout the month.  This needs to go to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone.

November:

ENA is purchasing 1,000 mmbtu/d from Quantum.  If Quantum produces more than 1,000 mmbtu/d that extra goes to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone.
ENA is not purchasing Westport's gas at this time.

I would be happy to make these changes, but I am unsure as to how this file affects your Meter Allocation report and I don't want to mess that one up!!!  

I'm copying Theresa on this memo....please feel free to add to it if I missed something.  

Thanks.

Gloria,
Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  

I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.

Let me know ,

There is an interconnect between WIC and FUGG for 09/01.  The WIC # ties to the

Could I take a look at 08/01?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.  A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the Enron Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions.

  

That sounds great!  Can you fax the 08/01 invoices to me at 713-646-8420?

and how might you want to be involved???

Contact me directly, I always want to be involved!

On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput during the work will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMCf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMcf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocations methods.

Do you have a web page or access to PSCO's tariff or rate information?

Let me know.

Thanks,

PS- how is everything going up there - this is totally crazy isn't it!

Gee Thanks Barry!! 
 
You know I must say it's been a while since the Packers have had to worry about beating the Bears.  It's kind of fun to see an old rivalry back again.  The Bears are pretty good this year and if the game was in Green Bay I would really bet on the Packers but I'm just gonna hope they can beat them in Chicago.  I hope we'll get the game here in Denver.
 
GO PACK GO........
 
Do you care to wager anything?
 

I thought you would put this on as a screen saver...( Just call it a gift).
 
Bears vs Pack this weekend at SOLDIER FIELD.  GO Bears.!!!
 
 
 

The deal was nominated and cut to zero.

Amy,
I just now opened my e-mail (7:30)  - I've been trying to figure out where you were because I saw the capacity reports and the Gas Daily.  I thought you left to go get breakfast.  DARN!.
 
I hope you feel better.   I wouldn't worry about coming in today.  Ty needs to work on our model before we could start anything anyway.
 
See you tomorrow.
 
Theresa

Theresa,
 
I ran the capacity reports and sent out the pricing sheet.   You should find a copy of the Gas Daily and the CIG reports on the printer.  I have a touch of food poisoning this morning but I may be in later.  I am connected to the network and just working from my house right now.... Call my cell phone if  you need anything or have any questions  I have been sick since yesterday afternoon so I am hoping that whatever I ate is almost out of my system.  
 
Thanks
Amy
 

FYI - 
Medicine Bow incremental Firm Capacity effective 11/12/01 is up to 4530 from 3410.

As far as the maintenance tomorrow, Adele said they won't decide on cuts until after 1st cycle and then the cuts will be based on nominations.  I'll let you know after lunch.

Theresa

Rita,

Scott Sitter (Crestone) and I have been working on this.  Scott has been trying to reconcile with FUGG on the 12/99 - 10/00 imbalances, then we can take it from there.  

I forwarded this e-mail to Scott to see when we can get together to finalize this.  I will get you a complete summary with all the backup as soon as I can.  (My guess is the last week of November - 1st week of December.  Scott is out most of this week on vacation and I'm out next week.)

I'll talk to you soon.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Theresa,

We are trying to ensure that we have the correct imbalances on the G/L for FUGG.  Can you confirm these balances or let me know what the true imbalances should be since they were not in Unify during this time?    Also, what is supposed to happen to these imbalances. - did they go over to Northern Border or will they ever be settled?  Thanks!

I was looking at Path Manager and it doesn't look to me like they even pathed this CAN point.  Let me know what you find out - Mark Bergeron at Woodward is expecting a call back from us (Paul Lucci) today.  
Thanks.

Theresa.

(The invoice they received must be based on nominations - right?)

Theresa - CIG just finaled their invoices today, and I am working on them.
I will take a look at this and get back with you.  Thanks, Gloria

I think we could probably do +.025 (we bid +.03 last month and I think he said .025 won.)

What do you think?

sure....005 lower than our last bid

Do you want to bid this for December?

Just wanted to remind you that the fuel bid for December (!) is due tomorrow.
The volume has been 500 - 1000 MMbtu.

Gloria,
Is there any way you could copy and send overnight to me the CIG invoices for the 33175000 contract from May, 2000 through January, 2001?

I am helping Darla and Megan reconcile the Citizens account.  It is changing over to Kinder Morgan effective Dec. 1 and we need to reconcile this account rather quickly.

I printed all other invoices on the Internet from CIG's website but they only go back 9 months.

Let me know if this is possible or where else I might find these.

Thanks,
Theresa

It's 10:10 our time and I didn't see the fax yet.  I wasn't sure what time you sent it.  

I have to take the kids to finish our shopping for the kids name drawing and we'll be done too.  We got Sierra an outfit from Old Navy - and I think she'll like it.

Talk to you soon.

Hi Theresa,
I just faxed 2 maps for you for you from the SF airport to our house.  Let me know if you get them ok. Any questions ask Dad this weekend.

We went shopping last night and found the Battleship game for Landon and our Old Navy store didn't have the pants in black with orange stripe so I got him gray with green stripe. We found a really cute outfit for Kayla at Mervyns. It's a beautiful blue velour pants set.  Now, I'm just waiting for the Bronco lamps to get here.  Penny's called the other day and said we should have them in 4-5 days.  I sure hope so!

Love,
Mom	PS:  I got you email on the air fare prices, I'll check later & see.

Megan,
Here are the producers for November for the Powder River system.  I don't have Lost Creek yet - hopefully before you leave.

Please call me if you see any problems.

There will be no sales invoice this month for Crestone and I've told this to Scott Dozier.

I will get the gathering to Gloria tomorrow.

Thanks again,

That's still not that great is it?

I tried but the  best they will offer is $369 and I don't know which
airport.  I had to put in 3 choices.

It probably won't be available until after the Holiday.   The reason I say that is because we haven't received the bill from Public Service yet. 

Are you out any time from now until the end of the month?

Theresa:
Do you know when the Citizens numbers will be ready for Oct. 2001?  I'm trying to get them billed before the holidays.

Thanks,
Megan

I'll have Amy watch for it for me and get it over to Craig Lipke if it comes in while I'm gone.  I will be out starting tomorrow until Wed. the 28th.

If I don't talk to you before then - Happy Thanksgiving!  I hope you have a great one.

Theresa

No, just Thursday and Friday of this week.  I will be taking the first week in December off, though.

I'm a little to quick for myself.  I needed to add the $15,000 facility fee to Independent. 

Here's the new one.

I talked to Susan Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a "paid invoices" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
 
I haven't seen Todd or Wayne and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them.
 

Have you heard anything about the rent check?  Let me know if you do not get an invoice from Todd for the remaining construction work.
 
Thanks

Sherlyn,
I didn't send you a note, but please call me and I can explain these to you.  (303) 575-6485

Thanks,
Theresa

Teresa,
Gloria is out today, but I think she was waiting to hear from you on the payments to Lost Creek and Crestone.  Do you have that information yet?

Jeff,
Attached is my resume.  I can probably be reached best on my cell phone (303) 807-6131 or at work (303) 575-6485.

Thanks again for thinking of me.

Theresa

 

Mark,
I'm sure you've already noticed this, but our cell phones have been disconnected.  

I thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report. Susan Helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid.  She said in Houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices.  She would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid.

I'll keep you posted.

Mark,
Susan said to go ahead and expense the cell phones.  I called AT&T and it was 176.92  so I put it on my credit card and I'll turn it in.  The phones should be on now.

This new counterparty is the old "KN Gas Services" counterparty.  They just changed their name
A contact would be Lori Leyda at (303) 914-4914

Thanks.
Theresa

I need all the information for KM gas services to setup a new counter pary in Sitara.  Correct counter party name, confirmation mailing address, contact name, phone number and fax number pls. Your prompt attention is appreciated.

Thanks,
SPR

Was our purchase tied to this wire your accounting group received?

Please check with Amy to see who will be responsible for the information in the future so I or the accounting folks will know who to contact.  thanks............

Real Funny!

** Proprietary **

Green Bay, WI:
Green Bay Packers football practice was delayed on Wednesday for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Head Coach Mike Sherman immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate.
After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually the goal line.
Practiced resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not likely to encounter the substance again.

Alan,
I'm not sure that our purchase is equivalent to the $1.55 purchase but I assumed you received an e-mail from Amy Felling in our office.

Here's the September purchase for September.  Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

Accounting has received a wire that they are now looking for backup.
Their initial review indicates that the pricing seems low.  I know that
pricing is pretty pitiful, but Gas Daily monthly average for Sept was
about $1.55 per MM.  Please forward the backup today if possible so we
can review.  Thanks............

Ladies,
Here's the revised September purchase.  Thank you Cheryl for bringing this to my attention!  Sorry about the mix-up.

Thanks,
Theresa
 

Mom,
That's sounds fine to me.  Would they go horse back riding that day or a different day?  Where they live will there be things for the kids to do?  It sounds like they have a lot of kids around so there should be things for them to do.

I talked to Jan this morning about a bigger cabin and the 10 person one is the biggest one.  She called and reserved another 4 person one for $100.  I'm gonna call Tim and let him know that he and Dawn can have that one.

I'll call you at work too  because I'm never sure if you get these e-mails from me.

Theresa

Hi There!
I got an email message from Sandy this morning and she has a good idea.  She wants Dad to make chicken booyah for us all at their house on Saturday. What do you think?

Here's part of her message;
Love,
Mom

Hi Carmen,

Still having problems with virus here, so our email has been up and down.
 
Verle told me your family is coming for Thanksgiving, how exciting! I have
about 27 coming for sure and maybe 7 more. My other two nephews and their
families have told grandma they want to come, but I have not heard from
them.   I was hoping Mike was willing to make boulia (sp?) maybe on
Saturday.  We could do it at my house.  If he will cook I will buy! That
would be so much fun, that way we could meet your family and you could meet the rest of Verle's.  I would love to take Dawn and Sara riding. When will
you know for sure if they are coming?

Well, I had better get to work.  Thanks for all the email.

See ya, Sandy

Theresa - here's the latest by month of the imbalance.  Please let me know if

look at the past stuff?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

I'm glad.  I'm very sorry about that mix up.  Thank goodness we only have one more month of this deal and it expires.  We did not re-new it.

Talk to you later,
Theresa

Theresa,

Don't worry about it....looks good now.
Thanks!

Okay Guys -  Call me CRAZY!

I don't know what I did, but I had the wrong Gas Daily pricing in the spreadsheet for September.

Please accept my apology... One would have thought I'd have this down pat by now.

Sorry about this.  I hope this is the last revision for September.

Call me if you have any questions.

Theresa,

I've redrafted and we're still off--even more now. Since we're ok on volumes now, it's got to be pricing somewhere. Please look over and let me know.....

thanks!

The only revision is the 15th on the Gas Daily volume.  It is 775 not 264.

Crestone should not be charging us for UA/4 (Unaccounted for). Our IT-002 contract is "all inclusive" which means no fuel or UA/4.  Walt and Scott will be fixing our statement and our # in the system is correct.
 
We will forward it to you as soon as we get it.
 
Theresa
 

Thanks for sending this.  But what is this UA4?  The cumulative imbalance in Unify is 3,292 and this report
is showing 3,997.  Difference is 705 (UA4)....

Hi Carole,
The Kennedy deal is effective December 1, 2001.  Paul Lucci said we're gonna need to all get together before we enter the deals.  He did not say when that would be.  I would assume this week sometime.

Thanks.
Theresa

Theresa,

Hope that all is well with you in Denver and that your trip to Houston last week was a pleasant one.  I was out Thurs. and Friday, but Anne was telling me that you guys did a deal with Kennedy Oil.  Do you have the Sitara deal #'s for that deal.  I need to link them up to the Tagg deal. Thanks.

I'll try and get to this later today.

Theresa,

The formula BP is using is highlighted in red below. After I inquired about the discrepancy, my counterpart at BP emailed her trader who talked to Paul Lucci. Apparently, BP is using the correct pricing. I just faxed copies of the invoices to you.

Thanks,
Genaro

Looks like our price is correct.  Let me know if there are any other
problems with this.  Thanks-

Just spoke with Paul Lucci at Enron.  He agrees that they are not showing
the correct equation.  Mine is correct.  His accountant will get back into
the office tomorrow to make corrections.  Let me know if you do not hear
from them in the next couple of days.

	 -----Original Message-----
	Janice-

	Good morning.  I have a price discrepancy for deal 120644/120643,
Anschutz Plant, for 8/01 and 9/01 (and if it is not corrected, we could have
a discrepancy for as long as the deal lasts, until 4/02).  Enron is showing
the rate to be Inside FERC NWPL Rockies + $0.02 less $0.09 (Mcf conversion).
In ET Deal our formula is (NWPL Rocky Mountains IF) + .02 - ((1.022-.995) *
(Kern Wyoming IF)).

	Can you please verify who is correct, and if Enron's rate is
correct, can you please make the changes for 8/01, 9/01 and the continuing
months in the deal?  If we are correct, can you please talk to your
counterpart at Enron to see about getting this resolved this month?  My
counterpart and I would both like to have this rate discrepancy cleared this
month.

	Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank
you for all your help.

Valerie,
I just wanted to let you know Logistics is working on actualizing a few days in September to correct the volumes allocated to each specific Greeley deal.  Jackie Adams is trying to get this done today.  The numbers in my spreadsheet by deal (bucket) are correct and we are waiting for the corrections in the system.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

Megan,
We only bought this on KN for the 30th.  I think it should be fixed now.  Let me know if it doesn't go away.

Thanks for keeping your eyes out there on our stuff!.

Theresa

Theresa:
Please check Devon SFS deal 933399 on KNE for 8/01.  We paid them for 8,000 on 8/30, but I am now seeing 8,000 on the 31st.  Do we need to pay for the 31st?  Deal 933399 does not have day 31 for KNE, so the volume is not pulling into settlements.  I see the extra 8,000 in volume management.  If it needs to be paid, we will need to add the day to the deal.

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!

Bob,
I'll take Denver to Win.

Robert,
I'm working on this right now.  What do you show as the storage schedule?

I have 2 different ones.  I know you changed it.  I just want to make sure we're both on the same schedule.  

I'll just make sure my volumes on storage match with the schedule and then I can send them all to you.
Thanks,

Theresa

Thersa,
Can you send me your revisions with the discounted price and commodity
charges applied to the planned storage injections today or tomorrow?  I
really need that ASAP to see if our numbers are getting any closer.  
I believe that the fuel calculations are being taken into account for the
planned storage injections for the whole path from CIG through WIC and into
Young Storage.  I was planning on calling you after I saw your revisions.

Thanks...Robert

Hello All,

The final payment of 1,937200 is in Sitara on Ticket #1087272.  I understand we will draft this for September and Jim Pond will re-classify since we've already manually paid.

I received too much money, so...

I ripped up your check  - can you please give Tyrell $10 instead?

Thanks!

I haven't seen it yet.  I know he's working on it.

As soon as I get it - I'll forward it to you.

Theresa

I still need the info to bill for Aug. Do you have it yet?

The team mate says were not interested at this point.  But thank you for the offer.

Well, I am never a slouch in this league either.  And if you haven't looked
lately, you're in deep shit this year.  Now let's quit bull shitting and get
down to it.  I am all about Win-Win here.  If your reasonable, I'll be
reasonable.  

Send me your address.  I'll send you a check.  All I have ever done is ask
Holloway to pay you with what he owes me for my finishes in the league.
Sorry it took so long.  I'll take up my problem with weak Scott H.

Thanks,

Okay mister....Team Chick hasn't been in the SuperBowl every year for no
reason.

We have always stuck with our original team unless there were injuries
so this trading thing is something we have to be sure about.  

I think we're in a pretty good position so far this year so don't rush
us.

We'll let you know in the morning if we are interested or not.

And by the way - where's our $60?????

OK.  Since yall are so slow to think, here are a few ideas.  You have
two
solid WR's in Moss and Owens.  I have two solid RBs in L. Smith and C.
Dillon.  

Or let's get creative.  I can solidify your Giant's RB situation with R.
Dayne and another second tier RB for one of the above.  

Let's think out of the box.  That dear in the head lights look is why
yall
are in the position your in right now.

What's your idea?

I want a good receiver.  You need a RB. 

I didn't mean to get you so bent out of shape.  I'll bug Holloway and let you know what he says.

I do have to wait until Nicole calls me back to see who she wants to trade for.  If she calls me yet today, I'll let you know.

Lisa Finley just called me to let me know that Devon Operators need to take Beaver Creek down tomorrow for 8 hours.  They apologize for the short notice, but said if they don't fix the cooler now it will bring the whole system down soon.  

We will be short by about 6,500 on the 005 contract for Gas Day 4 and I guess we'll have to work at paying it back.

FYI - from Robert Poole at Greeley Gas.

Robert:
Maybe we can get together later this week to see if we can figure out the difference for August.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Theresa

Thersa,
I recalculated the August invoice and I am still coming up with a difference
between your invoice and my calculations.  The difference for August is
$18,713.96.  I am issuing a adjustment for the $18,713.96.  So, when the
funds are transferred to Enron, there will be two transactions that will net
$794,486.45.  
Also, I am not paying the additional $10,210.77 PPA for July.  When you
revise July's invoice, I will pay based on the revised invoice.  
I will take the invoices down to Accounting tomorrow after they have been
approved.  John is out today, but will be back in the office tomorrow.  I
will try to expedite payment tomorrow.
Can you please forward this to Valerie?  

Robert

Robert, Valerie,

I have revised the fuel percent from .0107 to .0078.  Please call me if
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

(I will start working on correcting all prior months and get an
adjustment out soon.)

Valerie,
Are you still having trouble with this?  I may need you to fax it to me so I can see it.  Call me because I think I'll have to use a different fax number and I'll need to get that for you.

Hi Theresa,

I just got through redrafting for October to pull in the new storage volumes and prices. It looks like there are three new demand charges. I don't really understand since the last email you sent said you had to reduce the demand charge. If these demand charges are valid then we would need to send out a revised manual invoice. Let me know either way.

Thanks!

I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open 
issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney 
which he never responded to.

Tana,
Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast.  
The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded 
to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the 
Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the 
latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system 
and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their 
attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to 
you.

Hi Carol, 

Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you 
are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further 
information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on 
this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to 
cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they 
issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like to 
know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA 
amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up.

Hope all is well,

Russell

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Sara:
We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue.  
You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was 
limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the 
advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up 
with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated 
memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke).

Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should 
be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about 
this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take 
care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day.

(1)  On a "swap" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the 
ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on 
the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon 
the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty 
as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held 
in a U.S. account).

(2)  On a "credit" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception 
Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a "collateral letter" 
being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this 
project in your absence?

Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's 
all the news for now.
 
Talk to you soon.  Sara

P.S.  Can you send photos over the net?

Suzanne:
FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to 
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to 
do as much as I could before I left.

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?

I have sent to Mary and Tana the issues that need to be resolved on these 2

Mary,

Per my voice mail to you, I am updating you on the status of the ISDA's we 
have sent to Engage:

1) Engage Energy US, LP:
I spoke to Luke Mickum, the legal person at Engage US (713-877-7446), this 
morning.  He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed.  
According to Carol there are no open issues.  If that is the case can we send 
executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.  Before it is sent off, we 
need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the Credit Annex, as 
the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet.  I 
am not sure if Carol had made those changes in her drafts.

2) Engage Energy Canada, LP
According to the Lotus Notes Database, the draft amendment of this contract 
was also sent to Luke, although he is the US lawyer.  A draft needs to be 
sent to the Canadian Lawyer, Suzzi Sethi 403-297-0348.  She sent us a draft 
guaranty for review with the guarantor West Coast Gas Inc.  This counterparty 
is the new guarantor for Engage Canada and the ISDA Credt Annex needs to be 
updated accordingly.  Once again, we need to make sure the Credit information 
is still correct in the original draft.  I have given a copy of the guaranty 
to Tana, can you please review this and provide your comments to Suzzi.

Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Thank you,

Russell

I received your voice mail.  Can someone fax to me at home a copy of the 
latest Talisman ETA amendment that Dave F. looked at?  Also, would it be 
possible to indicate on what you sent to me the parts that Dave F. didn't 
like?  It would make it easier for me to respond and less time consuming 
since I don't have much free time during the day but I'm happy to help out.  
As Mark knows, this was a highly negotiated series of amendments over a long 
period of time.  My hope is that we can work through Dave's concerns without 
having to retrade what we had agreed to on the legal side.  My fax number

Suzanne:
That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as 
much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really not 
too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm still 
breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula 
so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house 
for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and 
with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the 
house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled 
him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in 
tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few 
weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably 
because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.

Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although 
there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to 
me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are 
sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.

Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I 
can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.  I'm really sorry to hear 
about Jim Grace's baby.  Please keep me posted.  It makes me appreciate more 
what we have.

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my

as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the

Hi everyone. 

I have volunteered as a campaigner for the United Way here at ENRON because I 
wanted to give-back to the organization that was instrumental in my father's 
comfort during his hospice.  I hope that you  will join me in achieving Ken 
Lay's goal of 100% participation by Wednesday, August 23.  

ENRON has created a home page making it very convenient to make a pledge.  
Please take a FEW minutes and visit http://unitedway.enron.com to make your 
confidential pledge.  

If you experience any problems entering the system please contact me at 
X57373 immediately.  We are in the process of ironing out a 'glitche' or 
two.  

Remember, No gift is too small.

Thank your for your consideration.

I understand there is an email out, which I haven't received, telling us that 
the people will be moving back into their offices tomorrow.  The next phase 
will start next week.  People have to be out of their offices by August 
23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully 
somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for your 
photographs.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll get a memo.  He must have put it on the 
slowest possible method of getting to us.

Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of 
course, had to say "how's it going" or something like that.  

Everything is fine here I guess.  I can't think of anything to report.  How

You've got an Ansel Adams photograph up here with a card.  Must be a gift.  
Do you want it up here or at home.  It's wonderful.  Are you familiar with 
Ansel Adams?  He took black and white photographs of Yosemite in California.

In the past few months (before Carol went on maturity leave) I have been 
communicating with Carol on possible positions available at Enron.  Due to 
the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not 
speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities.  
The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to 
the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the 
opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your 
area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is 
detail oriented and possess strong analytical,  communication and 
interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional 
responsibilities within the corporate arena.  

Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in 
the future.  Many thanks, Barb

Suzanne:
Could you please fill in my RC # and then send on to Linda?  Thanks.

Julia:
I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each 
other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps 
growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches.  
Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at 
night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not 
getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes 
it alot easier for me since we can trade off.

Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just 
to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going 
to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very 
much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in 
his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are 
hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected.  
He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel 
very, very fortunate.

How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with 
everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that 
you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think 
about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just 
beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair

Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home 
with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him 
while he is in school.

I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are 
your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up 
for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope 
to see you soon.  Take care.

Carol

Mark, Julia and Kristina:
We are planning to have Charles baptized on Sunday, September 24th and are 
having a luncheon at our house afterwards from 12-2.  My parents and younger 
sister will be in town and I would love for you to be able to meet them as 
well as see Charles of course.  I will be mailing invitations shortly, but 
thought that I would give you some advanced notice.  Don't worry if you can't 
make it as there will be plenty more opportunities to see Charles and of 
course you are always welcome to come out to the house for a visit.  Take 
care and see you soon I hope.

great vacation.  We are doing well.  I've joined some tennis leagues at the 
club that we belong to and they are alot of fun.  Feel free to stop by some 
time this weekend if you are in the neighborhood.  We will be around most of 
the weekend.  Charles is doing great and so are the rest of the family.  
thank God Bill is home with me.  He is a big help as is Arthur.  Hope to see 
you soon.

Hi Carol, I have your paycheck here, but nothing else.  Do you want me to 
just send it alone or wait. I know you have it automatically deposited.  Did 
you get the picture ok?  How did you like it?  Ric bought me one while we 
were in CA (not like yours, but a limited edition).  Those puppies cost 
$250!  That was a nice deal toy.

How's everything going?  We had a great time in CA, ate and drank our way 
through the wine country.  That's about all my news.

You did get my thank you note for my birthday present didn't you?  Thanks 
again!

Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I 
think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still

been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad.  
I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to

Hi Carol!

Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
(hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.

See you soon

Kristina:
I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I 
can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot 
of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with 
Bill home we pretty much just "tag- team" it with Charles  and the club 
provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great 
outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time.  
Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively.  
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles, 
he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped 
breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better 
particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm 
starting to get more sleep which is nice.

Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually here 
and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about 
coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's 
tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll 
get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.  Hope 
you are doing well and I look forward to seeing you soon, as well as having 
you meet my parents and sister and of course see Charles again.  Talk to you 
soon.

Call just to let me know how you are doing... I am leary of calling the house 
b/c you may have just gotten Charles or yourself down for a nap and the phone 
rings!

Sara:
 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

Suzanne:
Just checking in with you.  I'm really looking forward to next weekend and I 
really appreciate you volunteering to bring dessert!  That was really "sweet" 
of you!  How are things?  Everyone here is doing great.  Believe it or not, 
I'm playing alot of tennis and enjoying it very much.  There are leagues at 
our club almost every morning and with Bill at home, it has given me the 
opportunity to get out of the house and play with the "girls" which is alot 
of fun for me and is helping me get back into shape.  I hate to admit it, but 
between playing tennis and doing some volunteer stuff at Arthur's school, I 
could actually get used to this sat at home stuff although I still really 
miss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in 
a few months.

Charles is doing great.  Wait until you see how much he has grown.  I can't 
wait for my parents visit.  I just wish that they would stay longer!  Alos, 
don't be bashful about stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood.  
The only bad times are after 7 at night.  Charles gets pretty cranky around 
that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleep more during the 
day.  Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during 
the day but I need to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.

Before I forget, do you remember packing my gym bag, and if so, is that 
something that you can retrieve easily and bring with you next Sunday?  Some 
of my tennis shorts are in there and if there is a way for you to find it, 
taht would be great.

Well I've got to go.  Take care.

Enclosed is a draft of the CA agreement.  I spoke with DSavid this morning 
about the point that you had raised as item #3 in your last e-mail and given 
what Enron has done and might in the future do in this area, from a legal 
standpoint, I cannot get comfortable placing any further limitations on Enron 
in this agreement other than the disclosure and use limitations that are 
currently in the CA which we feel should protect RMS.  Ones interpretation of 
what is meant by "creating derivative works of" the data is to ambiguous for 
me to feel comfortable putting ahytning further in this CA.  I look forward 
to hearing from you.

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark

Hi Carol

busy and I need to fill in it with other things).  Let me know if you want to 
try and play. Hope all is well.

Any thoughts on whether we should give in with respect to the consequential 
damages issue?
Carol
David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
04/17/2000 01:38 AM
Carol, 

we have one remaining issue outstanding with United Energy on the ETA. They 
are still insisting on a exclusion of "consequential losses" from the 
indemnity given clause 4(a) of the ETA. Two questions 
Do we have a position on agreeing to exclude consquential losses from this 
clause? My own view is in this instance it is going to be somewhat "hit and 
miss" as what would be a consequential loss and what is not. That being said 
the general Enron position is to exclude consequential losses. In fact such a 
provision is already in the GTCs in respect of any Transaction.  Hence if 
there was a Transaction consequentiallossess would then presumably be 
excluded in respect of a related breach of the ETA.  
Utilicorp is a substantial equity holder in United Energy. I understand they 
are trading through EnronOnline. Do we know what they have agreed?  
David Minns
04/12/2000 06:12 PM
Peggy further my previous email. Two additional points;

I believe it is best for us  to move to replace the Deemed ISDA Agreement. 
This will provide a cleaner contractual basis for EnronOnline trades. We 
should be able to settle a  ISDA  Master Agreement quite swiftly  using the 
existing commmercial terms in the Deemed ISDA. If you are concur with this 
course of action we will forward to you tomorrow  a Schedule  for  review.  
In respect of Section 4(b) of the ETA we would be agreeable to add the 
following at its end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises 
from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, 
agents or contractors.''

Peggy my apologies for not replying sooner but I was overseas.  Let me 
respond to the points you raised.

Deemed ISDA Agreement- We would be most happy to provide a letter that you 
could aknowledge that the Deemed ISDA Agreement is a master agreement for the 
purposes of the ETA. I would prefer not to make a formal amendment as this 
may exclude a subsequent Master Agreement from applying.
Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd. is the Enron counterparty for all Australian 
power trades. If that is your preference then access can be limited to only 
those products. You could write to us stating this is your position. However, 
we have found that counterparties have not found this necessary. Your 
EnronOnline Master User will set access levels for your individual traders. 
Many counterparties appoint a person from their Controls group (not a Trader) 
as their Master User.   This gives them the flexibility to broaden/ reduce 
access themselves.
Excluding "consequential loss" in this circumstance is quite broad but if we 
could work through some scenarios hopefully we could find some words to 
accomodate your concerns.
When we last spoke you mentioned the concern here was the possibility that  
the password may be disclosed from other than a UE source ie Enron. I have 
talked this issue through with our systems people as to the nature of this 
exposure. What happens is that the password which is issued to a user is 
immediately changed after it is received from Enron. Hence the source of the 
password must be the relevant counterparty. Whether improper use is a result 
of the counterparty's negilence or some other cause such as an unauthorised 
use or disclosure by one of its personnel is not relevant. What is of concern 
that the loss would have resulted from or arose out of a Counterparty's 
"access to or utilisation of the Website".    

Perhaps you would give me a call so we may discuss any outstanding points.

Further to our conversation this week regarding our outstanding issues in
the Electronic Trading Agreement, UE suggests the following way foreward.

Enron sends a letter to UE to be countersigned.  This letter covers the
following:

* it is a variation to the ETA;
* all Transactions entered through EnronOnline will be covered by the
Deemed ISDA Master Agreement signed between UE and Enron Australia Finance
and dated 8th Feb 1999;
* Transactions at this stage will only be between UE and Enron
Australia Finance;
* amend clause 4(b) to exclude indemnification against consequential
loss;
* amend clause 4(b)(ii) of the ETA to remove the wording "whether or
not Counterparty has authorized such access" and provide appropriate
replacement wording that ensures UE is only liable where access is obtained
through UE's negligence.

Please let me know if Enron would agree to this.

Regards
Peggy

Sara and Mary:
Here are some dates in the next 2 weeks that work for me for lunch:

Next week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday

Hi Carol

How about Wed, the 8th?

Suzanne:
Sorry I didn't call you last weekend.  How's everything at the office?  Is 
Julia back yet?  I wrote her a card and I hope that over the next few weeks 
and months she can grieve and at the same time get on with her life.  I 
really feel for her.  Keep me posted on how she's doing?  What have you and 
Ric been up to?  Charles and Arthur are doing great.  Bill's mom is here for 
a visit and we are having alot of fun.   I had lunch with Kristina last week 
and she updated me on the "Enron" happenings.  Seems like every week there is 
a major organizational announcement.  Where do you think Scott Sefton will 
end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that 
apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in 
touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it.  
Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so 
Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i 
still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start 
discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.  It's hard to believe 
that I have been out for over 3 months.  time really does fly by.  

Give my best to everyone and write back when you can.  Did Stacy have her 
baby yet?

Great!  The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the "yellow entrance"  to the 
Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the 
open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the 
right).  Met is on the 6th floor.  I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go 
ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be 
fine - just let me know.  Looking forward to playing.

It was hysterical.  Ric had to tell me to quiet down!  It was so funny!

Looks like the 15th works for everyone.  I look forward to seeing you both 
then.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  It's hard to believe that 
Charles will soon be 4 months.  Time really does fly by and I am really

Mark:
Sorry I haven't called or written in quite some time but I'm in my own little 
world here at home.  Things are going very well here.  Charles will be almost 
4 months old and I can't believe how much he has grown.  We finally have 
established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm 
starting to get more sleep which is nice.  I'm still running and playing alot 
of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity.  I have really enjoyed my stay 
at home.  It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur 
and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with 
them.  I feel very fortunate.

I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I 
can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my 
thoughts about returning to work.  It's something that I haven't given too 
much thought to but need to as the end of the year approaches.  Here are some 
good dates for me.

November 13th, 16th, 17th, 21st, 22nd.  Let me know waht works for you.  
Sorry that I haven't brought Charles up to see everyone but with all that we 
have going on here it's hard to find the time to make the trip into down 
town.  Look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your note and glad to hear you are all doing well.  I'd love to 
have lunch - let's do it on the 21st (I'm out of town the earlier dates and 
the 22nd is the day before Thanksgiving).  We do have a lot to catch up on 
(EGFinance changes, new hires for the group, new internal lawyers for the 
group, office space issues) - I haven't wanted to bother you at home but 
things are definitely moving around here - as usual I guess.

Thanks.  Which person are we interviewing on each day?

Susan:
I've been intending to send this e-mail to you for a few weeks but somehow 
got distracted.  I was wondering how things have been going with you over the 
past few months and was hoping that you could send me an e-mail with your 
impressions of the group and how it has been doing since my leave.  As for 
me, I'm doing great.  Charles is really growing fast and it has been a great 
experience for me staying home with him.  I'm really enjoying it, although I 
miss work too!   I'm sorry that I haven't brought him up for a visit but we 
have been so busy here that it's hard to plan a trip downtown, but someday 
I'll make it up there.  Hope everything is going well with you.  Look forward 
to hearing from you.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=

EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=

newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=

services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20

=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=

I am really looking forward to seeing you and Mary next week.  Bill has jury 
duty on Tuesday and I'm assuming that he will not be picked.  I'll let you 
know if we need to reschedule.  I am doing well and so are the boys.  I 
played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday and got caught up a little bit 
on what has been going on but it looks like things have changed alot since my 
departure.  How are things with you, both personally and professionally?  How 
is the group doing?  I'm having lunch with Mark T. the week after next at 
which time I hope to get a better idea of what his plans are for me should I 
return to work next year.  Drop me an e-mail if you can and see you next week.

Suzanne:
Just saw the org chnages memo.  Seems like alot has been going on.  Would you 
mind mailing the memo and charts to me?  For some reason, our computer does 
not print out charts.  How are you doing?  I'm doing great although I wish we 
knew who our next president is going to be.  I played tennis with Elizabeth 
Sager yesterday.  She is really good and I hope we get to play more.  I'll 
give you a call maybe later today or tomorrow.  Take care.

Mark:
I'm looking forward to seeing you on the 21st and getting somewhat caught 
up.  I thought that it might be helpful to you to let you know what I have 
been thinking about in terms of work, although I would ask that you keep this 
confidential until we have had a chance to talk further and make some 
decisions.

First, if I do return to work, it will not be until sometime in January and 
you and I can talk about a date that makes sense.  I think that this is 
consistent with what we had talked about before I left.

Second, I would like for you to give some thought to the idea of me working 
part-time for a period of time.  Bill and I have talked about this alot, and 
I feel that I need some time at the outset to make the transition from what I 
have been doing to going back to work.  We can discuss further what this 
means, but I really feel that it would not be good for me or my family for me 
to start off working full time.

Next, I would like to talk with you about what my responsibilities would be 
in the swap group if I return and have a clearer understanding of the areas 
in which you would want me to work, particularly now that we have more 
people.     I know that alot of chnages have occurred in the last few months 
and I'm hoping that there are specific work areas that I could devote my 
attention to.

Those are my thoughts for now.  As for my office, I really don't care where 
it is or how large it is so just do what you need to do.  I hope that you are 
doing well and I'm really looking forward to seeing you.  I will bring 
pictures of Charles.  He is doing great!  Take care.

I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4 
month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can 
come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We 
live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone 
that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you 
know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I 
would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me 
know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think 
might be able to help.  Thanks.

I am sure Irma has come up with a position by now, but I will give you her
name and number just in case.  It is Irma Navas, 713/838-7360.  She speaks
very limited english, so if you don't speak any Spanish that could be a bit
of a problem, although her daughter *(age 18) is bi-lingual.

If I hear of anyone else I will keep your name around.  I got my nanny thru
word of mouth -- seems like the a common way!

Thanks for offering to participate.  I will probably go ahead and get her the 
gift certificate from Urban Retreat.  I just need to hear back from Mary 
before I get it.  Looks like everyone else has already gotten her a gift.  
Things are going great here.  Charles is now a little over 4 months old and 
almost 16 lbs. and is doing great.  I'm sorry that I haven't been up there 
for a visit but hopefully someday soon before he goes off to college I will 
come up for a visit!  Hope that you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing 
you soon.  Also, we are beginning the "nanny" search.  If you know of someone 
or agency that you would trust please let me know.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day, but can be flexible on the hours 
because Bill will be here.  Take care and thanks again for the offer on 
Suzanne's gift.  If I do something different, I'll let you know.

Hi Carol,

I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but 
only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny 
Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a 
wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut 
case.

Good luck,

Kay

Mary:
Thanks for the info and I will check with Stacy.  I am planning to return 
sometime around January 8th assuming I can find someone.  I have thoroughly 
enjoyed my time at home and hope that the transition back to work goes 
smoothily.  I'm sure it will take me a few weeks to get back into it after 
being away from it for 6 months.  Charles is doing great as is Arthur.  Look 
forward to seeing you soon.  Would $25 be okay with you for Suzanne's gift?

Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Hi again:

Fast response, I know.  I was sending a message to Travis when yours came in, 
so I'll reply right away.  I would like to put in $35 if that is okay with 
you - I'm not sure what the grand total would be.  Good luck again with nanny 
search.  Glad to hear that everyone is well.  Hard to believe, but Britta, my 
oldest, just had her 14th birthday last week!!  They grow so quickly and are 
so precious.  Take care,

for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you 
may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please 
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila  
contributing.  Are you interested?

Carol,
Although I would enjoy speaking with you in person, PRC is occuping alot of 
my time and will do so for the next 2 weeks.  I have addressed your questions 
in red and hope have been clear in my response.  Please let me know if you 
have any further questions.

Norma:
My husband and I have the following HR questions that I hope you can help us 
with.  As you may know, I have been out since July 12th on maternity 
leave/extended unpaid leave of absence.  My plan is to return to work on 
January 8th.  Here are my questions:

1. I am considering coming back to work on a part time basis.  From a 
benefits standpoint, is there any difference between a RRH employee (30-39 
hours) versus a RPT employee (20-29 hours)?  In others words, are there any 
benefits that I would lose if I worked part-time?

The difference is in the amount of Flexdollars you would receive, as stated 
below:

 Medical Coverage Semi Monthly 
    Flexdollars
RRH Employee Only  123.22
 Employee/Spouse 146.97
 Employee/Child 137.00
 Employee/family 165.25

RPT Employee Only  82.15
 Employee/Spouse 97.98
 Employee/Child 91.34
 Employee/family 110.17

2. Given the fact that I am not returning until January 8th, am I still 
eligible for any stock option grant program that the company may institute at 
year-end?  
 That is currently under discussion in developing the new Stock Option 
program.  However, they are leaning towards allowing individuals in your 
situation to be apart of the program.
Is there any additional paper-work that I need to submit to keep me 
eligible?   No.
Both my immediate boss, Mark Taylor and our general counsel, Mark Haedicke 
are aware of the fact that I am not returning back to work until January, 
2001.

3. Our bank account has been recently changed.  I pulled down the "Direct 
Deposit Authorization" form and I am assuming that all I need to do is to 
fill it out and send it back to you.  Is that correct?  Yes, please send to 
EB3698
What is your office location?

4. As I get closer to my return date, is there any paperwork that needs to be 
submitted to notify payroll of my return since I am currently not being paid?
 No.  Your time will be change coding from LOA without pay to Active time.

I look forward to hearing from you either by phone or e-mail.  My home phone 
number is 281-890-7122.

Mark:
I wanted to let you know that I did meet with Mark Haedicke last week to 
discuss my work situation, and in particular, coming back on a part-time 
basis sometime in January.  I think that he was okay with what I proposed, 
which is to work approx. 30 hours a week on a 4 day week.  I would like your 
input on which day you would prefer I take off, as my initial thought was 
Friday, but I'm open to suggestion on that.  I think that the next step is 
for the 3 of us to meet to discuss what my role in the group will be, and in 
particular, what work areas I will be responsible for.  I will try to set 
something up in the next few weeks.  I alos had lunch with Mary and Sara and 
was encouraged with what I heard from them.  We talked about the possibility 
of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals, 
work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.  What do you 
think about that idea?  As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some 
direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group 
and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it 
seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what 
work is in order.  Let me know what you think.  Take care.

Carol

Carolyn:
Does this date work for Julia?  It looked like from your earlier message that 
the 19th was the only date that worked.  Both the 12th and the 19th work for 
me.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Jeff Sorenson forarded me your letter to him regarding the Annex A letter 
that you received.  The reason that you received this letter was because of 
trades that we do with Aquila Canada Corp.  You are correct that we are in 
the process of finanlizing a Master with UtiliCorp but only trades with ARMC 
will go under that Master.  We are alos in the process of sending out a draft 
of the Master that we intend to put in place with Aquila Canada Corp but 
until that is completed, all trades with ACC will be done using the Annex A 
terms and conditions.  Please call me if you have any questions at 
713-853-3989.

Ms. Daley:
Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me your March 21st letter which responded to the 
Annex A letter that we sent to you.  I left Robert Schulten a voice mail 
message about this some time ago and have not heard from him.  Can you and I 
talk about this.  We have extended our launch date until May 1st.  Our

August, 1999.  My phone number is 713-853-3989.

Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me the March 21 letter that you sent to him in

your company and didn't see any chnages.  Could you please call me to 
discuss?  My number is 713-853-3989.

David:
Could you please confirm the following for me:

1. With ACE USA, Inc., we confirm using the "deemed ISDA" format.  For some

2. We only do physical deals with Northern Indiana Public Service Company and 
the "Columbia Gas" entities.  Again, they too were on our Annex A list.

Thanks.

One more request.  Could you have someone pull the latest confirms that we've 
done for the following Canadian counterparties and send them to me and Derek 
Davies  Thanks.

710719 Alberta Inc.
Bonavista Petroleum
Invasion Energy Inc.

These counterparties were on the latest list that Mary sent to us and 
according to her records, have recently done trades with Enron Canada corp.

Jeff:
I spoke with Derek Davies.  He claimed that he knew nothing about his request 
to us not to send the Annex A letter to the latest set of Canadian 
counterparties and I made him check his e-mail for the messages that I sent

Joe and David:
Both Williams and Richardson Products have the typical confirmation process 
language in their ISDA's where we send out the confirms and they have 3 days 
to object.  The Williams Master is governed by NY law and Richardson by Texas 
law so we are safer under the Williams Master if they are not signing.  With 
respect to Morgan Stanley, we are the confirming party.  The Master was 
amended to provide a procedure for them indicating their acceptance of the 
confirm other than by signing it and it involves them sending us a letter 
stating that they approve of the confirm.  I will send copies of the 
amendment and letter to you.

I hate to keep asking "what can I do to help the process along" but I am.
My understanding is that our attorney, Mike Kessler, has faxed the motion
back to Enron and is waiting for a go ahead before we have it filed.  Should
you need me to come downtown to sign any of the amendments, or explain what
we are doing, please do hesitate to cal me at 713-964-9444

Enclosed is the Stratus Ca that we discussed earlier.  Here are the main 
differences between our agreement and theirs:

1. Our term is 1 year.
2. Our agreement resolves disputes by arbitration, although it allows them to 
go to a court to obtain injunctive relief.
3. Our agreement has a much narrower definition of Confidential Information 
4. Our agreement has no "use" restriction
5. Our agreement has different procedures for returning/destroying 
confidential information.

I will have hand delivered to Lucy the CA on ENA letterhead with my initials.

discussed this afternoon that our counterparties would send to us:

We hereby confirm that the confirmations that have been sent by you to us in 
connection with the transactions that are described on Exhibit A attached 
hereto correctly set forth the terms of the transactions between 
In drafting this, I am assuming that the information that would be on Exhibit 
A would be something like the deals numbers and perhaps trade dates.

Mr. Stout:

Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to 
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with 
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20 
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph 1.

Will you pass it on

Here is where I will be until around 1 on Friday

assuming no complications.

Sara and I have some swap legal issues that we would like to discuss with

3 of us, if possible this week, but if not, as soon as possible next week?  
Thanks.

Could you also set up a meeting with the lawyers and legal assistants in our

Thanks.

I'm going to be out on Friday of this week.  Is there any way that I can get

outstanding?

I spoke with their counsel today and he promised to look at the comments that 
I sent him a few weeks ago and to try to get this finalized by May 1st.  I'll 
keep you posted.

 I have been advised by our Client Services office that 4 vans will

My son's baseball game was re-scheduled for tonight so I will be unable to

about me in his presence!
Carol

Tanya:
Here is the issue with respect to the Goldman Guaranty.  The new Guarantor is 
now The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (previously it was The Goldman Sachs Group, 
LP).  In the existing Guaranty, we permitted Goldman to assign its rights to 
a Successor Guarantor without our consent if the Successor Guarantor met the 
following qualifications:

1. (a)  if the Successor Guarantor is a corporation, at least 50% of the 
voting stock had to be held by the same entities/persons that owned and 
controlled the previous Guarantor

 (b)  if the Successor Guarantor is a partnership, it had to be controlled by 
the same entities/persons that controlled the previous Guarantor.

2. the Successor Guarantor's Credit Rating could not be lower than the lesser 
of (y) A2/A or (z) the predecessor Guarantor's Credit Rating prior to the 
transfer

3. the Successor Guarantor had to have a total net worth of at least 
$200,000,000

4. the Successor Guarantor had to be the direct or indirect parent of J Aron.

Their lawyer is telling me that now that Goldman is public, it cannot agree 
to item #1.  Are you okay if the criteria is just items 2,3 and 4?

Carol

Susan:
Thanks for your e-mail.  Please try to make the Columbia matters more of a 
priority and if you need to, Tana is available to help out on the day to day 
stuff.  I really want to get this put behind us in the next 1-2 weeks.  
Thanks.

Luanne:
Our credit people are okay with doing without the change of control condition 
that is in the current Guarnty.
Carol

Suzanne:
Please set up a meeting next week with Rod Nelson to talk about issues 
relating to the Reliant Energy Services draft ISDA and CSA Schedules.  We 
probably need about 1 hour.  Thanks.
Carol

Taffy:
That works for me.
Carol

Adele:
Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the ISDA and CSA Schedules that 
you sent to me:

1. In Part 1, Section (e) of the ISDA Schedule, right after the definition of 
PSE&G Reorganization Transaction you need to delete "S&P".  I also need to 
see what you are planning to put on Annex C.

2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you added 
to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.

3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at 
$7,500,000.  In addition, in the proviso after threshold, the term "Specified 
Condition" should be changed to "Material Adverse Change".  A Mac would be 
triggered if Credit Ratings were below BBB-.

4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of collateral are cash or 
LC's why is consent required to substitute?

5. I would like to discuss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13, 
Section (h)(iii).

6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(ii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?

7. I need to discuss with you just a few issues on the LC provisions.  I will 
send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.

Hopefully we can get this resolved next week.  Tuesday through Thursday of 
next week work best for me. I will fax to you a mark-up with my nits and 
comments on the lC language.

Carol

This looks fine to me

David:
Can they send you copies of the confirms for these deals?  Also, Derek 
Davies'  fax number is 403-974-6706.  

Carol 

4:30 works for me.
Carol

Jeff:
I think that we need to continue to pursue Williams and Richardson on getting 
either the confirms signed or getting a letter similar to the Morgan letter 
that they accept the terms of the confirms.

Lisa:
I will have Susan Bailey get these executed and then give to you.  I will be 
out tomorrow, but thought that you could coordinate with KCS in having them 
sign them.
Carol

Anne:
Thanks and sorry for not calling you.  I'm going to be out tomorrow and this 
afternoon is hectic so I will call you next week.
carol

Lucy:
Sara and I met with Mark today to talk in part about the concerns I had about 
the HDD info that third parties had requested us to provide.  He wants us to 
talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks 
associated with us giving this info to third parties if a portion of such 
info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.  I'm out 
tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I would very much like to have this 
discussion at our Monday morning meeting.  does everyone on your side know 
about the meeting at 10:30 and can they attend?  If that time is a problem, 
please contact my assistant Suzanne Adams.

Carol

Tana:
Could you please have the clerks hand deliver this to Dave Forester?  Alos, 
can you update Mark on what happened with Susan Bailey this afternoon with 
respect to the last interview and how much time if any she spent in that 
interview?
Thanks.

carol

Mike and Zachary:
Enclosed are the execution versions of the Amendments which have been 
executed by Enron and which Lisa will be sending to you for execution by your 
client.

Donald:
Thanks for your message.  We are planning to meet as a group on Monday and 
make a decision.  I will talk to you next week.  Enjoyed meeting you.
carol

Mark:
I asked Tana to talk to you about the Susan Bailey situation so you are aware 
of exactly what happened today.  Both Sara and I think that it would be very 
helpful if you could communicate to the legal assistants what we talked about 
and that is that vacation day requests, doctors appts etc should be 
communicated in advance to the whole group and they should make sure that at 
the very least that the calendar reflects all vacation days.  However you 
decide to do that is fine with us.
Thanks.

I have a doctors appt first thing Monday.  I should be in the office between 
10-10:30.

Sara:
I would prefer not to but will if you can't.

Laurie:
Thanks so much for your support.  I will have Bill drop your campaign stuff 
off at your house.  We are having a boyn and I have less than 3 months to 
go!  So far so good, although as of today, no more running and no more trips 
out of town.  Hope you are doing well.  Did you ever sell your baby stuff?  
If not, we may still be interested.
Carol

Jeff:
Here is what we are doing today with respect to the revised form of Annex A:

1. Marie sent to Bob Bowen yesterday the new forms of Annex A for ENA and ECC 
and it is my understanding that as of today, these forms will be used for all 
new Omnibus Counterparties.

2. Last week, Mary provided us with a list of new Omnibus Counterparties for 
the month of March and with the exception of the Canadian counterparties, we 
are in the process of faxing the Annex A letter which gives them until the 
end of April to respond.  With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are 
waiting to hear back from Derek before we send them the letter.

3. We need to receive from Mary a list of any additional new Omnibus 
Counterparties, if any, that have done trades with us since the date of the 
list that she gave us last week so that we can include them in the mail-out.  
It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about 
this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to 
those counterparties.  Hopefully, that group will be small.

4. The plan is to roll out the new Annex A's to everyone beginning on May 1.  
I will update the Special Handlings List to include those counterparties that 
have requested special exceptions that we are okay with.

I will be at the Enron legal conference the rest of the week but will be 
checking voice mail.

Hey Carol, I received a call from Bill on my voice mail and I wanted to let 
you know that I would be glad to support him and if he would like me to put a 
sign up in my yard I would happy to.  My address is 8611 Ballinger Drive.

I hope you are feeling well, do you know the sex of the baby yet?

ll

Suzanne:
Could you please call this guy and let him know that I am out of the office 
today and that I will call him sometime tomorrow.  Also, thanks for your 
message.  My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report 
before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning 
when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about 
what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will 
know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He's 
almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless to 
say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny 
thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could 
not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there 
so she used the word "relations".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was 
saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a 
good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me 
right in the eye and said "no more running" which is what I expected.  Again, 
you had to be there!

Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take 
it one day at a time.

Fred:
Enclosed is a revised draft of the letter agreement.  Two points for you:

1. They want to roll over to next month the net payment that they will owe us 
for the month of March.  Are you okay with this?

2. They wanted to make it clear that their obligation to deliver barrells to 
us was only an amount equal to the amount that they own or control, even if 
that amount is less than the amount shown on the schedule or oin the Purchase 
Agreement.  In other words, they have no obligation to make up the 
difference.  Asr you okay ith this.  Alos, he told me to delete the "Amoco" 
language since  that lease was no longer part of the deal.

Let me know what you think.

carol

Jeff:
Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves 
entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back 
with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:

1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete 
the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this 
conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which 
allows for recovery of attorneys fees.

2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction 
clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, 
execution, attachment or other legal process.

Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps 
that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase 
Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what 
we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we 
ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting 
them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if 
there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done, 
that would be great.
Carol

FYI.  I spoke with Lisa Mellencamp about Donald yesterday and her contact had 
nothing bad to report about him from a work standpoint.  The only negative 
comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a 
"flirt" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female 
employees at the firm.  Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite 
a pest.
Carol 
Hi Carol:

How are you doing this beautiful morning. Thanks for the telephone call last 
night. I am thoroughly happy that you are still interested in me. I was 
hoping you would be. As I mentioned to Nedre Strambler, I have been wanting 
to work for Enron for quite some time. I believe that Enron is a top class 
organization.

With regard to references, I would appreciate it if you would not contact my 
present employer at this time, but in the alternative, contact my past 
employer for references.

My immediate supervisors with Star Enterprise were as follows:

1.    Jerome (Jerry) L. Francis, Esq., Sr. Real Estate Specialist  -
       (713) 241-1823 [PLEASE NOTE, I TRIED TO CONTACT JERRY THIS MORNING AND 
HE IS ON VACATION. HE WILL RETURN TO THE OFFICE ON THURSDAY, MAY 4, 2000]; and

2.     Gary W. Dzierlenga, Esq., Real Estate Specialist  -  (713) 241-1813.

In addition to the above, you may contact the references listed on the Enron 
Job Application that I completed.

After your conversations with the above references, if you feel a need to 
speak to my current employer references, please advise.

Again thank you for your continued interest in me. I look forward to hearing 
from you real soon. I look forward to becoming a part of the "swaps and 
derivitives" group at ENRON!

Have a great day!

Don

Gary:
Could you please call me at ext. 33989 and explain to me how this termination

Donald:
Thanks for your e-mail and phone mail message. It would be very helpful to us 
if we could talk to someone at Gardere Wynne although I understand how 
difficult that may be given your situation.  Could you please give it some 
more thought and if you could come up with someone let me know.  In the 
meantime, I will call your other references.
Carol

Please review this applicant's resume and let me know if you think we should 
interbiew her.

Just wanted to see where things stood from your end on your Guaranty.  We 
have been asked to consent to an assignment of trades bewteen J Aron and 
Statoil and would very much like toi finalize the new Master before we give 
our consent.  Please call me when convenient to discuss.

adele:
Just wanted to get back to you regarding the one remaining issue on the ISDA 
Schedule.  With respect to Section 7 - Transfer, we would like to keep the 
original language.  We view the "credit rating" language as a one time 
exception which if we need to we can deal with separately, but any subsequent 
transfers after that we want to use the more generic language.  Can we set up 
a call to discuss this and my other comments which I sent to you?  Let me 
know some times this week that work for you.  Thanks.
carol 

Suzanne:
There may be a few more parties that the letter will need to go out to.  
Marie will find out tomorrow and will contact you.  If you have any questions 
about any fax nos. or addresses, Mary Gosnell can help you.  Thanks for 
helping out.
Carol

Susan:
Sara and I want you to meet and talk to Jackie McKoy and Stephanie Panus so I 
have asked Taffy to set that up.  Sara and I plan to talk with them again as 
well.  

Susan and Tana:
If you would like to join Susan in talking to either of the 2, just let Taffy 
know.

Trina:
This looked fine.  My only comment is in the Contingent Adjustment Amount, is 
it clear to you what the term "Shares" covers?

Carol

Thursday Am is fine.  I will try to be home by 7 on Thursday.
Carol

Cynthia:
Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:

1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?

2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone 
and not necessarily followed up in writing and that this is the practice.  
Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?

Carol

Luanne:
Thanks.  I will take a look at this.  Please do prepare execution sets of 
everything.  If you send them to me by mail (e-mail would be fine too) my 
address is 1400 Smith Street, Suite 3892, Houston, Texas 77002.
Carol

Luanne:
This looked fine.  In the first paragraph please change the name from Enron 

Tanya and Tana:
We have reached agreement with J Aron on everything.  I hope to receive 
execution docs soon.
Carol

Tana:
FYI.  This is who I am dealing with at J Aron.

Thanks Carol, it will be FedEx -- I will send the copies after they have

Thanks for the info.  I left a voice mail for Lou Stoler about the need to 
get outside counsel involved and he is going to look into that.  I will send 
you the CA shortly as it is in the process of being prepared.  I also spoke 
with Elizabeth Sager in the power group about assisting in the documentation 
of the derivative and she has agreed to help.  It may be a good idea to 
schedule a meeting with me, Elizabeth, Lou , you and others to walk through 
the derivative piece in more detail so that the power folks can ask you 
questions about it.  My assistant Suzanne Adams has my schedule (37340),  
Elizabeth's assistant is Brenda Whitehead (35438) and Lou's assistant is Dina 
Snow (57099).

Leslie:
I'm hoping you can help me answer a questions that John Roberts of GPU raised 
regarding their desire to sign up on EnronOnline.  GPU Utilitiues is the 
parent  corp that has 3 operating subs under it (Metropolitan Edison Company, 
Pennsylvania Electric Company and Jersey Central Power & Light).  He 
mentioned that there is some type of Services Agreement bewteen EPMI and GPU 
Services Corp.  He wants to know which legal entity should be on the omline 
application.  Can you help?

Brant:
Aquila Canada has been striking the "affiliate" language in the setpoff 
provisions of Annex A to the Onibus confirmation.  Are you okay with this?

Carol

Lisa:
I'll be interested in their response.  Stacy is still working on the form of 
amendment and we had hoped to fax it to KCS sometime tomorrow.

Carol

Mary:
I spoke with John roberts today.  He will send me their comments to the ETA 
shortly.
Carol

Rod:
Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
"materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to 
"netting".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

Carol  

Gaurav:
Thanks.
  Could you e-mail me the address for ACE so that I can complete the CA?
Carol

Susan:
We have finally had a chance to internally discuss the comments that you sent 
to Marie Heard on March 21 by e-mail and here is our response:

ISDA Comments

1. Item #1 is fine

2. We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties

3. It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I 
believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a 
compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 
2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.

4. Item #4 is fine.

5. Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces 
the collateral threshold to zero.

6. I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing 
Guarantys.

7. Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.

8. I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10   

CSA COMMENTS

1. Item #1 is fine

2. We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20

3. I would like to discuss item #3 with you

Also, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault 
termination was not in our draft, but in yours).  Could you please e-mail me 
your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the 
changes?  With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter 
agree to that.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol (713-853-3989)

Brant:
FYI
Carol
Thank you for your comments Carol.  By copy of this email, I am forwarding
them on to John Shuttee who is now responsible for ISDA negotiations.  He is
out of the office the remainder of this week but as of Monday he can be
reached at my old phone number of 713-420-3548.

Thank you.

David:
To whose attention ahould a counterparty fax termination notices to?
Carol

Bill:
You can spend all weekend doing it, but one of us needs to be at his game and 
I will  not be able to make a 6 o'clock game.  Could you please skip 
Wednesday?  Alos, if Chelsea cannot do Monday, who will?  Also, as we have 
discussed previuosly, I would prefer not to handle these types of discussions 
by e-mail.  Please call me or talk to me when we are at home.  This is not a 
practice that I think is in the best interests of either of us to continue.
Carol

Jeff:
I'm inclined to give in to their comment but I would like some confirmation 
from V&E that what they have said about past deals is correct.  Alicia, could 
you check this?
Carol

David and Louise:
I am working with Bob on a confidentiality agreement with Organic Inc. which 
contains a mutual "no solicitation" provisions that would prevent either 
party from hiring or soliciting for employment any employee or independent 
contractor of the other for a period that would expire 6 months after the 
termination of any business relationship of the parties.   How do you feel 
about this?
Carol  

Linda:
I understand that Stacy will be coordinating with you tomorrow to get this 
completed.  When it is done, I need for you to fax it to Harry Stout 
(713-877-8006(phone))(713-877-1394 (Fax)) and Zachary May (212-310-8000 - 
phone)(212-310-8007 - fax).  Thanks.

Carol

Jeff:
Sorry this took so long but here are my thoughts on the above:

1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added 
because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that 
correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I 
think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such 
failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the 
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals? 

3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.

Carol

David:
Thanks.  Per my voice mail messgae, are you okay with giving Cinergy the 
right to terminate?  This apparently is there only issue.  Also, how do you 
want to handle future requests for termination rights if we can't geta 
counterparty to back down from their request?  Do you want me to check with 
you each time?
Carol

Bob:
As currently written with my changes, we will return any written confidential 
information.  In addition, to the extent that we prepare internal analyses, 
memos etc.  that contain confidential information, we usually do not want to 
give our work product to the other party.  Therefore, we agree to keep it 
subject to the terms of the CA or destroy it and that is what my Insert A 
says and that is why I deleted their language.

With respect to the term Representative, that should be defined to mean any 
director, officer, employee, counsel, representative and affiliate of any 
party as well as any affiliate's directors, officers, employees, counsel or 
representative.

Have you reviewed the description of Confidential Information, and in 
particular, clause (d) and are you comfortable with it.  Other than the 
reference to the Website, is there anything else that we should add as a 
description of what we are showing them?

Finally,  per Louise's e-mail, she doesn't want to agree to the no 
solicitation language until we contract with them.  Could you please 
communicate that to them?
Carol

David:
Grant has faxed to me Crestar's comments to the PA and ETA.  As I explained 
to Grant, some of them are legal and some of them, I think, will require 
input from you and perhaps can be resolved in a call to them.  I am going to 
have this delivered to you with my thoughts on some of the comments assuming 
that we couldn't talk them into accepting these docs as is.  Please let me 
know when convenient how best to proceed.
carol 

Jim:
We have finally devised a procedure for handling termination rights.  I will 
amend the ETA amendment letter and send it to you.  We have a new procedure 
in place that requires me to get commercial approval for all amendments so I 
first will need to run this by the head of the Online group but will send it 
to you right after I receive that approval.  Sorry for the delay.
carol

David:
Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with 
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them 
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?
Carol

 

Richard:
Could you please take a look at point #6.  This is the online counterparty 
who had requested in their arbitration language that only monetary damages 
are available as a remedy in any arbitration proceeding and that under no 
circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against 
them.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

carol
Carol:
My comments are shown in CAPS below.  Once we have agreed on the edits to
the Online Agreement, I am assuming that you will provide a revised version
of the agreement for me to review -- is that correct?  I should be able to
respond very quickly once our final power rates record of decision is sent
to the printer (May 5).  Thanks.
Joyce

Joyce:
Per my earlier e-mail message, I have had a chance to discuss your proposed
arbitration language with our litigation manager.  We can accept your
proposed
new language with the following chnages:

1.   From our language in the ETA, we need to keep in the provisions
regarding
treble, exemplary and punitive damages.  This is Enron's current policy.  I
ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE SENTENCE:  "ONLY DAMAGES ALLOWED PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE AWARDED AND THE ARBITRATORS SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO
AWARD TREBLE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND/OR THE FAA OR AAA."  THIS IS OK AND CAN BE
INCLUDED IN MY SUGGESTED DISPUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PARAGRAPH THAT ADDRESSES
REMEDIES.

2.   In the first paragraph of your language, we would like to delete the
last
sentence.  THIS IS OK.

3.   With respect to the selection of the arbitrators, we would like to keep
our
language that each party can select 1.  We have no problem going with your
language on selecting the third from a list.  THIS IS OK.

4.   We cannot agree that monetary damages are the exclusive remedy.  How
would
we enforce the confidentiality provisions?   We need some other way to be
able
to seek non-monetary remedies for those types of breaches.  THIS MAY BE OUR
ONLY STICKING POINT.    GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A
BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.  IN A BREACH OF CONTRACT
CLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION
(28 U.S.C. 1491).  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED FOR SUCH
RELIEF.  [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSED
DISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.]
SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL
CLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.  BONNEVILLE
IS NOT AMENABLE TO (NOR MAY IT BE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO) ENTER INTO
CONTRACTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ARBITRATORS WITH AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT WHICH
CONGRESS INTENDED TO BE APPLICABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.

I CANNOT ASCERTAIN FROM YOUR COMMENT WHETHER YOUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT
BONNEVILLE IS A FEDERAL AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT.  IF THAT IS YOUR CONCERN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE
ADDED TO YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF
COMFORT THAT INFORMATION THAT ENRON DEEMS CONFIDENTIAL IS NOT DISCLOSED
WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENRON TO RESPOND:

"SUBJECT TO BONNEVILLE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5
U.S.C. 552, AS AMENDED), THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), THE TRADE
SECRETS ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1905), AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS,
BONNEVILLE SHALL TREAT AS EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ANY TRADE SECRETS
AND COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
PROVIDED THAT IT IS PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL AND IS SO DESIGNATED BY
ENRON.  IN THE EVENT A THIRD PARTY SEEKS DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, BONNEVILLE SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY ENRON OF
SUCH EFFORT, AND ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENRON TO PROTEST SUCH DISCLOSURE.
BONNEVILLE SHALL USE ITS REASONABLE EFFORTS TO AVOID DISCLOSURE OF ANY
PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION."

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Carol:  Per your voice mail I am attaching a portion of a memo that has not 
been circulated yet, but it summarizes the requirements, approvals and 
notifications required by Corp and ENA Legal policy regarding Standstills, 
Nohires and Noncompetes in confidentiality agreements.  This is the portion 
relating to Nohires.
 The memo I've been working on is a summary of Jim Derrick's 10/27/99 memo 
regarding required approvals plus other ENA policies and language re these 
provisions.    THis language is the same as the memo from Lance that you 
mentioned.
 Regarding approvals, since business persons (Detmering, Metts) must make 
them there is much feeling among attorneys I work most with that business 
persons should secure these approvals.

Let me know if you have comments, questions or need anything else.

Thanks for the update.  Looks like we are getting close.  Let's go ahead and

you for the legal asst. position.  Sounded like he wnted to think about it

Carol 

Mr. May:
I am working with Lisa Mellencamp on this matter and I just wanted to let you 
know that we will be sending you sometime tomorrow a completed draft of the 
amendment to the financial derivative and physical agreements that we want 
the Court to approve.  The purpose of the amendment is to expand our setoff 
rights and to add additional events of default/termination events that relate 
to events that may occur during the bankruptcy proceeding.  We will be out of 
the office the rest of the week at our legal conference but you can leave me 
or Lisa a voice mail message with any comments or questions that you may 
have.  My number is 713-853-3989.
  Enclosed is a preliminary draft that just deals with the financial 
derivative agreement.  Another lawyer in our group is handling the physical 
agreement amendments.

Reliant who is also  the issuing agent for the sureties in this matter,
available for discussion with you and your people, either for a conference
call or in a meeting at ENRON, if you prefer.

I look forward to hearing from you.

We are really close on finalizing the EEI.  The following are open credit 
points with them:

1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.

2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light 
and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.

3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.

4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a 
creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee or 
its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses 
(ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occur 
as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic 
creditworthiness test.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Enclosed is some sample surety bond language that we have used along with a 
surety bond form.  I have reviewed your form and think that we can use it 
with some minor modifications. The enclosed provisions will need to be 
modified to fit our situation and taht is part of what I want to discuss at 
our meeting next week so we can all understand how the bond gets issued, what 
it covers and how it gets triggered.   I look forward to seeing you next 
Thursday.

Re the below, contact the credit group to see if they can speedily resolve 
the credit issues so as to bring the EEI to bear on the transansaction, 
clearly the best result.  Credit will also indicate whether the size of the 
trade is such that they want to insist the trade is done under a completed 
EEI Master, rather than being documented the 'old way' and then brought under 
the EEI Master upon its completion.  If the trade will be completed under the 
Tariff, you'll want to look at the Tariff to see what underlying terms you're 
dealing with (e.g., 1 year limit on term of trade completed under the Tariff, 
availability of LDs for a trade involving LD energy, etc.)

If not already known to you, Genia or Elizabeth may have input on where 
things stood in Janice's negotiations with CP&L.

Kaiser is hopeful that an answer on this can come quickly as they would like 
to enter into the physical index deal as soon as tomorrow or Friday.

Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation ("Kaiser Aluminum") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap 
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. ("Kaiser 
International") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant 
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International 
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING 
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?  
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with 
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward 
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off 
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need 
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as 
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about 
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.  
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter 
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, 
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June 
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy

Where does EPMI fit in if we are doing a financial power swap?  Who are the 
Enron entities that are involved and what contracts are currently in place 
with the Kaiser entities?  Are we netting overall exposures and using one 
collateral threshold?  Are we cross defaulting all of the contracts?  What 
exactly do you want to accomplish with the netting agreement?

Rod,

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Tracy,

Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week?  I believe 
that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across 
non-defaulting (Enron) entities.  Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) 
given opinion to this idea.  Historically, I believe the opinion has long 
been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) 
in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of 
bankruptcy.  However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting 
(though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.  Introducing 
the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the 
likelihood.  Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser 
entity, netting almost certainly will not work.

Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form 
of governing confirmation and legal entity?  I believe that she is in the US, 
but should be checking in.  Perhaps you should try calling her?  I think we 
will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum.

Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal.  Volumetric/CVAR type 
analysis may not yield such reliable results.

Rod and Paul:
I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff 
language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting 
Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party 
under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located 
the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an 
answer this morning.

If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there 
other credit issues that need to be considered?

Rod:
Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If 
not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions:

 1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold

2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of 
Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its 
credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In 
each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.

3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a 
MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an 
Event of Default occurs.

4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts

With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if 
it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same 
Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has 
appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a 
Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff 
rights.

What is the next step?

Hi Carol.  Great to hear from you.  I hope all is going well.  

Diana Higgins who is a manager (credit) in the metal area will be the 
principal credit person.  I would say that Kaiser is a low grade credit and 
the contract should be robust with early termination and collateral rights.

Rod and Paul:
I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff 
language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting 
Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party 
under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located 
the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an 
answer this morning.

Rod,
If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there 
other credit issues that need to be considered?

Attached you will find the latest draft of the new Master Form.  Please 
review and send me any comments today--we'd like to get this out to the 
business team by 3:00 today.  I think all of the comments we received and 
developed in the last 3 meetings have been incorporated, including the 
bankruptcy matters.  Because there are so many changes, I don't think a 
blackline would be helpful--however, let me know if you want one.   I have 
bracketed questions and open issues and highlighted areas that I think need 
either more work or extra attention from the business teams.  I'd like to see 
us be able to pare this document down just a bit--I think a 5 page master and 
a 1 to 1 1/2 page confirmation is reasonable.  Thanks.   MDS

That is fine. I will make all of the chnages and send it around.  Also, on 
Constellation, I left a voice mail for their attorney that we have approved 
the CSP language and that I need to see their Guaranty.  What cutoff date are 
you expecting to see?  The last draft that I saw said June 30, 2001.  Is that 
acceptable?

Hey Greg.  I see no objection to amending the ISDA to cover power 
transactions.  Also,  potential credit exposure related to a prompt month 
power trade should be modest.  You may want to ensure that Tracy has no 
objection, but this transaction should be fine.

Rod

Rod:

We are looking at doing a June physical index power purchase today with 
Kaiser. however, Kaiser only wants to proceed if we can assure them that we 
can add electricity to the existing ISDA between Enron and Kaiser such that 
they could fix the price during the month of June. After reading your comment 
below about netting it appears that a longer term transaction would not be 
advisable until further legal clarification occurs. Is there any reason we 
can't or shouldn't pursue adding electricity to the ISDA provided we only do 
one month transactions (assuming we see no risk of near term bankrupcty)? 
Please advise immediately. 

Tracy,

Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week?  I believe 
that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across 
non-defaulting (Enron) entities.  Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) 
given opinion to this idea.  Historically, I believe the opinion has long 
been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) 
in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of 
bankruptcy.  However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting 
(though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.  Introducing 
the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the 
likelihood.  Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser 
entity, netting almost certainly will not work.

Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form 
of governing confirmation and legal entity?  I believe that she is in the US, 
but should be checking in.  Perhaps you should try calling her?  I think we 
will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum.

Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal.  Volumetric/CVAR type 
analysis may not yield such reliable results.   

Rod

Rod,

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Thanks,
Tracy

There is a Master Commodity Swap Agreement dated May 1, 1996 between Kaiser

Hello claire- I have spoken to EML's documentation department who confirmed 
that the Kaiser  entity used for  financial trades is  Kaiser Aluminium & 
Chemical Corporation. I can also confirm that there is an  ISDA Master in 
place  between Kaiser and ENA, effective August 28 1997, but there is no ISDA 
Master (signed or in negotiation) with Enron Metals Limited, the financial 
trading arm of Enron Metals. EML trades have been running from 9 Jan 2001 to 
4 May2001.

Hope this helps

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

Phyllis Lemell

Phyllis:
Here is where I understand we are with the LOC provisions and the LC for.  

1. No changes will be made to the LOC provisions.

2. In the form of LOC, i will delete the language in drawing condition 1 "the 
entire undrawn amount of the LOC" and put in "$___________."  I will alos 
delete the automatic renewal language in the third paragraph such that it 
will read "This LOC shall expire _____ days from the date of issuance."

Are we ready to finalize?  If so, I will e-mail to you final forms of the 
docs.

Carol - I have reviewed the changes in both forms attached.  In the LOC, I 
think that they are getting at the point to allow for partial drawings and 
requesting to reduce the auto renewal notice clause to 30 days from 90 days.  
Seems okay to me.  The proposed changes in the Letter of Credit Provisions, 
please ignore.  I have discussed this with them and they have come off it.

Ed Sacks

Ed-

We received an email from your attorney about the LOC format for the two
contracts.  Our legal counsel has reviewed the format and the provisions
for the LOC and we have two proposed changes to the LOC format and one
proposed change to the Letter of Credit Provisions.  Please call me to
discuss these issues.

(See attached file: Enron LOC language EEI 052501.doc)

(See attached file: Enron ISDA LOC Format 052501.doc)

We would like to keep this process moving forward and finalize the
contracts.

Ron and I discussed your comments. We don't have a problem with a 3-
business day requirement for posting cash collateral nor a 3-business day
requirement for " transfer date" interest posting.

 We have a question into our counsel (who has been out sick) on whether we
need some form of Board approval for posting collateral.

Our main concern (and the reason we would like a 10- business day time
period) is if we choose to provide credit support with a LOC, we don't have
the staffing and bank pre-arrangements to be able to put an LOC in place
within a shorter period. Since we don't currently exchange collateral,
posting a LOC would not be something we do in the normal course of business.
As such, if the need should arise, we would like to have sufficient time to
allow staff to look at our alternatives and provide the form collateral that
best suits the situation.

Hi Stephanie,

Maclaren doesn't have an entity which can act as a process agent in the US.
How about this as a suggestion:

"(c) Process Agent.  For the purpose of section 13(c) of this Agreement:

Process Agent for Party A shall be its legal officer at its address for
notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party A at
such address.

Process Agent for Party B shall be its legal officer at its address for
notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party B at
such address.

For purposes of this Part 4(b), a "senior officer" shall be any officer of
such party with a title of vice president or higher."

Michael

I have asked Maclaren for one in NY, and will get back to you.  Do you have
a Process Agent in Quebec, as it doesn't help Maclaren that yours is in
Washington?

As I understand it, there are no outstanding issues - the credit issues
have
been resolved (I guess you have received this update since you are
preparing
the final drafts).  Once we clear the Process Agent point, the documents
can
be executed.

As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:

1. We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.  

2. There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed.  
Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks 
accept in its credit agreements.

3. We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.

4. We prefer the Loss method.

5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the 
"materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the 
timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the 
Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for 
posting an LC.

6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a "Specified Entity".  We need to 
discuss with you your request to modify the definition of "Specified 
Transaction" to include physical transactions.

7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure 
through the posting of collateral.

8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).

9. We need to discuss the arbitration language.

10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of 
Default Rate and Interest rate.

11. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity 
Definitions Supplement?

12. In the "Recording" section we would like to add the phrase "To the extent 
permitted by applicable law" at the beginning of the last sentence.

13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.

14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial 
obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral.

15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding 
amounts.

16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Please see below.

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

Jack:
I will send you an open issues list shortly.  I considered items # 2,3,4,6, 
9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need 
my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:

1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with 
you on the concept.

2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.

3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general 
rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the 
Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements 
with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate 
agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the 
guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty 
takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.

4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.

5. I agree with your point #13.

6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the 
concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured 
Party is holding  the cash collateral.

7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash 
collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated 
all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination 
amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.

8. The "deemed occurrence" language  is meant to cover termination events 
that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as 
in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We 
could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on 
bankruptcy.

I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but 
maybe you and I can make some progress.

Hi Carol -
Sorry for the delay.  The "credit person" at Inland is probably Julie Beck,
although she can naturally be overruled by the Temple-Inland Treasurer, Dave
Turpin, or CFO Randy Levy, since Temple-Inland will be obtaining the letter
of credit and will serve as guarantor.  Since they are at least one step
removed from the process, if you could tell me what questions/comments from
my 5/16 memo they will need to address, and ideally your
responses/commentary in some summary format, I can upstream this information
to them, obtain their feedback, and speak on their behalf.
Thanx,
Jack Falconi

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward

respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure

suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Below is a summary of the surety bond issues that I believe we need to 
resolve in order to feel comfortable accepting it as a form of collateral to 
secure a counterparty's obligations with respect to physical power purchase 
and sale transactions:

1.  Determine whether an issuer can refuse to honor a draw made under a 
surety bond if after issuance, it determines that the bond was issued in 
violation of the appleton statute.  What type of legal comfort should we 
receive from the issuer at the outset to get comfortable that the bond was 
validly issued and is enforceable against such issuer?

2. Determine the proper minimum credit rating(s) that should apply to the 
issuer.

3. In the form of bond that we were given, the "Now Therefore" language in 
the third paragraph is not acceptable.  Determine what can be said in its 
place to establish the necessary linkage back to the transaction covered by 
the Confirmation.

4. Make sure that the bond can be drawn down no matter what type of Event of 
Default occurs, even if such event is not related to the transaction that the 
bond references.  The Notice of Claim language needs to be written more 
generically to accommodate this. 

5. Does credit need a "pre-bankruptcy" trigger that would require Reliant to 
convert all outstanding bonds into LC's or cash collateral?  If so, what 
would this trigger be?

Let me know if you have any additional issues.  I will be discussing some of 
these with our outside counsel shortly.

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Thanks.  Just a few questions for Carol and Ken:

1. Will there still be a MAC trigger and if so, will it remain at the parent 
level?

2. I am assuming that we still want to receive Holdings" financials.

3. Sounds like what we want AK Steel to say is that  it will remain as the 
only subsidiary of Holdings.  Is that the concept that you want them to 
covenant about in the ISDA?  I would suggest doing it as a covenant so that 
it would lead to an Event of Default if it is violated.  Does anyone have any 
thoughts on this?

Credit said that they will wave the parent guarantee.  The provision will be 
waved if AK Steel states, whether in financial documents or by written 
letter, that every entity within AK Steel Holding is also every entity within 
AK Steel Corp.  I have passed this on my contact in AK Steel's Treasury and 
they are going to get back to me.  I will be on the road tomorrow but you can

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

Jack:
I will send you an open issues list shortly.  I considered items # 2,3,4,6, 
9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need 
my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:

1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with 
you on the concept.

2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.

3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general 
rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the 
Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements 
with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate 
agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the 
guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty 
takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.

4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.

5. I agree with your point #13.

6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the 
concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured 
Party is holding  the cash collateral.

7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash 
collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated 
all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination 
amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.

8. The "deemed occurrence" language  is meant to cover termination events 
that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as 
in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We 
could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on 
bankruptcy.

I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but 
maybe you and I can make some progress.

Hi Carol -
Sorry for the delay.  The "credit person" at Inland is probably Julie Beck,
although she can naturally be overruled by the Temple-Inland Treasurer, Dave
Turpin, or CFO Randy Levy, since Temple-Inland will be obtaining the letter
of credit and will serve as guarantor.  Since they are at least one step
removed from the process, if you could tell me what questions/comments from
my 5/16 memo they will need to address, and ideally your
responses/commentary in some summary format, I can upstream this information
to them, obtain their feedback, and speak on their behalf.
Thanx,
Jack Falconi

Jack:
My assistant will be calling you to set up a time next week when Ken Curry
and I can discuss your comments with you and your credit person.  Her name

Please see below.

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

(See attached file: Enron EEI LOC Format REVISED 052901.doc)
(See attached file: Enron ISDA LOC Format REVISED 052901.doc)

Carol:  I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists
the open transactions.  How are you making out on the revised version of
the LOC?

Keith:
Thanks for your prompt response.  I can respond to some of your comments.

1. In point #1, I was referring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed 
Section 5(a)(vi) from cross default to cross acceleration.  From a credit 
standpoint, we prefer a cross default trigger.

2. I will check with Ed on point #2.

3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the difficulty in perfecting 
an interest in cash collateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian 
counsel as well as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this issue), we do not accept 
cash collateral from Canadian counterparties.  With respect to surety bonds, 
there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a 
surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance.  For this 
reason, we do not accept surety bonds as collateral.

4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes.

All of the other points need to be discussed.  Can we now schedule a call for 
later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues?  Please 
let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach.  I am not in the 
office on Mondays.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol, thanks for your list. I have inserted some comments/responses on a
preliminary basis in the hope that it will help Encore focus on the issues.
I have not spoken to Mike Roach on the credit issues since receiving your
email.

Keith:
As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:

1.   We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.
[KF: I assume you are referring to "Default under Specified Transaction".
Encore's view (and the view of a majority of its counterparties) is that
where the same parties have both physical and financial transactions
outstanding, a default under one category of transaction is sufficiently
significant that it should trigger a default under the other. There may be
reasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate, and we would appreciate your
comments.]

2.   There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be
discussed.  Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that
its banks accept in its credit agreements.
[KF: In the transactions documented in November/December of last year, the
$100 million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relation
to Enron Corp., and a $50 million threshold was accepted for Epcor Utilities
Inc.  I'm not sure why the reduction to $25 million for Epcor was suggested.
More importantly, I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussing
an alternative, which would be a percentage of net tangible assets, and that
Mr. Sacks was going to give that some thought.

3.   We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.
[KF: Our concern is that creates a risk for the non-insolvent party in
relation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatic
termination clauses in their agreements. The short-form agreements signed in
late 2000 appear to accept automatic termination.]

4.   We prefer the Loss method.
[KF: Are you opposed to the non-defaulting party having the choice between
Loss and Market Quotation?}

5.   We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining
the "materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the
timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as
the Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for
posting an LC.
[KF: I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach. With respect to the
second point, we are advised by Epcor's treasury group that the time frame
is necessary, and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify as
Eligible Collateral; if the time frame is required to produce an LC, we
would envision putting up cash within, say, a two Business Day period and
substituting an LC when it is issued.]

6.   We would like to make the GP of Encore a "Specified Entity".  We need
to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of "Specified
Transaction" to include physical transactions.
[KF: I assume this is related to your first point.]

7.   In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a
cure through the posting of collateral.
[KF: Agreed; I assume the value would be an amount determined by the other
party, acting reasonably?]

8.   We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).
[KF: If Alberta law is to apply, we thought Alberta courts should have
jurisdiction. I understand that both parties have offices and conduct
business in Alberta.]

9.   We need to discuss the arbitration language.
[KF: For background, this language was proposed by Enron and is consistent
with the approach taken in the prior agreements.]

10.  We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of
Default Rate and Interest rate.
[KF: Again, this was done to "Canadianize" the agreement. References to U.S.
rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didn't seem appropriate.]

11.  Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity
Definitions Supplement?
[KF: I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule.]

12.  In the "Recording" section we would like to add the phrase "To the
extent permitted by applicable law" at the beginning of the last sentence.
[KF: Agreed.]

13.  We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.
[KF: This is a significant issue. In the event of a fixed for floating price
swap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price, my
understanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with the
floating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers.
Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that the
commercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No Fault
Termination is the better approach.]

14.  We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure
financial obligations.   Looks like LC's would be the only form of
acceptable collateral.
[KF: Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue. He also advised that
Enron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concerns
about perfecting a security interest in cash. Can you outline the concerns?]

15.  We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the
rounding amounts.
[KF: I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs. Sacks and
Roach. I also understand Mr. Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerning
what he perceives to be the "political risk" in the Alberta marketplace, and
that this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues are
addressed. Can you confirm?]

16.  We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer.
[KF: I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point in
part involves understanding which banks are involved. If the Epcor
information has not been provided, please let me know and I will arrange to
have it passed on.]

I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
However, as a result of 
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy

In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
"money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that "money" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the "account" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an "account" is an "intangible" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that "money" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

Senate leadership has not yet figured out how they will organize the

Thanks.  I'm checking with Vicki Sharp to see if we want to do anything.  
Where can  locate the latest version of the bill that would have the proposed 
changes to the forward contract definition?

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward 
contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with 
respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure 
what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to 
suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it 
something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt 
the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's 
primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by 
possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that 
we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze 
let's talk first.  Thanks.

I spoke with Lech about the Article 9 questions.  He is going to send me some 
articles that they have written which I will send to you.    He alos 
confirmed that the cash perfection issue has not changed  under new Article 9 
although his view on it was that this type of collateral under the UCC is 
more like a deposit account than "money" which, under common law principles,  
gets perfected through the exercise of dominion and control over the cash.  
Under the new Article 9, deposit accounts are covered and the new Article 9 
codifies the common law control test.  e alos expressed a view that It may 
take longer than July 1st for NY to adopt the new Article 9.

I don't like specifying a time period for termination. I remember we had a 
lengthy discussion on this with Mark Taylor. I seem to recall that the 
solution was that we would employ resonable efforts to process the 
termination request (please confirm with Mark). I don't think they will be 
happy with three days.

David:
Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with 
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them 
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?

After our meeting yesterday, I asked Mark Taylor whether under the revised 
version of the CEA there was any restriction on one's ability to cash settle 
physical transactions.  He confirmed that so long as the parties to the 
transaction are "Eligible Contract Participants", then there is no 
restriction and our physical contracts can expressly permit cash settlement.  
Enclosed is a summary of the ECP definition.

My comments on the Master Steel Agreement are as follows:

1.   Section 3.7 - The Taxes arising at the Delivery Point should be the=20

responsible for all Taxes applicable to the Commodity being sold under the=
=20
Master Agreement arising upstream of the Delivery Point and Buyer should be=

=20
Master Agreement arising at and downstream of the Delivery Point).

2.   Section 3.7 - The phrase "within [___] days" should be added immediate=
ly=20
before the comma in the sentence beginning "[i]f Buyer and Seller are unabl=
e=20
to reach mutual agreement...."

3.   Section 3.7 - The following sentence should be inserted before the=20
sentence beginning "If either party is exempt from Taxes...":

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party is not liable for any applicable Tax=
es=20
that are legally imposed on the other Party and that are refundable to the=
=20
other Party, including without limitation value added or goods and services=
=20
taxes.

4.   Section 9 - The following sentence should be added to the definition o=
f=20
Delivery Point:

For purposes of  transactions involving an Option on the Commodity, the=20
Delivery Point shall be defined to mean the date of delivery to the Buyer o=
f=20
written confirmation of the purchase and sale of the Option, which date sha=
ll=20
be in all cases not earlier than one day following the day of acceptance of=
=20
the Counterparty=01,s offer.

5.   Section 9 - The phrase "goods and services taxes," should be added to=
=20
the definition of New Taxes immediately after the phrase "value added taxes=

6.   Section 9 - The words "value added, goods and services," should be add=

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before 
the word "change" and after the word "in".

3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon 
at the end of clause (i).

4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is 
still an open issue.

5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in 
the beginning of the Section.

6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load 
Factor.

7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.

8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?

9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line 
of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word 
"this".

10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I 
will also add granting/perfection language.

11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm 
not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.

12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.

13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).

I would add setoff language.

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

language needs to be eliminated.  It simply refers to the same ICC

generally.  Is there some specific concern that we can address?

Please see below.

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

(See attached file: Enron EEI LOC Format REVISED 052901.doc)

In my opinion, the wording suggested by Janet Green should be acceptable.
We
will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies
prior
to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all
questions
have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds
being
subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will
address
that with the sureties along with other potential changes.

In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that
would
be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the
Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do
with
the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the
State of
New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.  MJH

                    Janet K Greene
What if we said:  "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
obligation shall be null and void"

With respect to her second point, what if we again said "an Event of
Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
the Master Agreement"?

I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

We have financial exposure of 4.2MM to United States Gypsum company which may 
file Ch. 11 due to mounting asbestos claims.  S&P has not taken any action 
since Jan when they lowered ratings to BB-/Negative and removed from Credit

alternatives", one of which is Chapter 11due to increased litigation. I'll

I have reviewed your comments to the ISDA and CSA schedules.  I need to check 
with our credit person to see how he wnats to handle the Independent Amount 
issue.  On collateral substitutionh consent rights, given the fact that we 
can only choose between cash and LC's is consent really necesssary?  We would 
prefer to be able to freely substitiute.  Let me know what you think.

Jay:
Jeff Hodge forwarded your voice mail to me.  I will give you a call later 
this morning to talk about the LC margin language that you need.  It might 
help me if you could describe how the margining will work.  Typically there 
is some dollar threshold against  which our Exposure is measured and anything 
over that threshold needs to be supported by collateral.  In addition, there 
is usually some Material Adverse Change trigger that reduces the threshold to 
zero.  Is that how yours will work?

Thanks for the information.  I need to take a closer look at Janet's 
language, particularly the "null and void" language to make sure that it 
covers all possible events of default under the Master Agreement.  As to the 
Texas law issue, our ability to get comfortable from a legal standpoint will 
in large part be dictated by this issue.  Is there anyway to get more 
certainty on this with the sureties?  I understand that you don't want to go 
to them multiple times but this is a key issue for us.  Let me know what you

the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the
State of
New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.  MJH

What if we said:  "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
obligation shall be null and void"

With respect to her second point, what if we again said "an Event of
Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
the Master Agreement"?

I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

I received a voice mail from Kristina Drew this morning indicating they 
received FERC approval of this assignment on 5/31/01.  Are we working on an 
amendment of the contract for Wendy per her email?  When we are ready, 
Kristina indicated that we should print 3 originals of the assignment and 
change the date on it if we have no other changes.  Please let me know status 
so I can email her.  Thanks.

FYI
Wendy will be the lead on this and I will assist her.

Christina Drew has now notified me that effective May 31, 2001, FERC approval 
has been secured.

Therefore, at this time she would like to go forward with the consents she 
furnished to us for review last month.

If their forms meet with your approval, please date them effective as of 
today.  

We are to have triplicate originals of each Consent signed by ENA. 

Let me know if I may be of assistance.

Cordially,

Thanks for the information.  I need to take a closer look at Janet's
language, particularly the "null and void" language to make sure that it
covers all possible events of default under the Master Agreement.  As to
the Texas law issue, our ability to get comfortable from a legal standpoint
will in large part be dictated by this issue.  Is there anyway to get more
certainty on this with the sureties?  I understand that you don't want to
go to them multiple times but this is a key issue for us.  Let me know what

In my opinion, the wording suggested by Janet Green should be acceptable.
We
will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies
prior
to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all
questions
have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds
being
subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will
address
that with the sureties along with other potential changes.

In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that
would
be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the
Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do
with
the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy.  I thought 
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as 
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI:  the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must 
secured.

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work 
on this matter.

Jack:
Thanks for your e-mail.  I met with our credit people this morning and can 
respond to some of the credit points raised in your May 16th memo:

1. With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our 
credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral 
Threshold definition.  

2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way 
you suggested with  additional language that states that any drop below BBB- 
also counts as a trigger.

3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective 
rate which my credit person is thinking about.

4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that 
your comment is correct.

5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the 
definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.

6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to 
$500,000 and to limit "returns" of collateral to once a week.  We cannot 
agree to change  the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.  Given 
the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market 
change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.

7. With respect to item #14, there is no requirement to escrow cash 
collateral that is being held and the Secured Party is free to do whatever it 
wants to with the cash until the events in 13(g)(ii) occur, in which case the 
cash collateral must be held by a Qualified Institution.

8. With respect to item #19, if we draw the entire amount of the LC and the 
termination amount that we are owed is less than the LC amount, we would be 
required under the documents to return any excess amount to you.  All we are 
doing in an Event of Default situation is converting the LC into cash 
collateral that we hold subject to the terms of the documents.

9. We can agree to make the chnages that you requested in item #18.

I still need some clarification on the point you were making in item #17 and 
I will look at your other comments in today's e-mail and respond shortly.  
Are you okay with the Enron and Inland forms of Guaranty?

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner Carol.  Greg Wolfe was out on 
paternal leave (he and his wife just had a baby...Annika) and therefore, I 
was unable to get the continued green light from Greg.  Just spoke with Greg, 
and he would still like for legal to pursue w/UK legal.

Thanks,

Tracy and/or Rod:
Just curious about what happened to the proposed trade that we were going to 
do with Kaiser.  Is there anything that the lawyers need to do at this point?

Joe, Jeff an Bob:
Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections 
to our new form of Annex A:

1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply

2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff 
language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if 
they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.

3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the "or otherwise" language in 
the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.

4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting 
a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few 
days.

5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this 
one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.

6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening 
letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial 
derivatives with them recently.

7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to 
tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with 
their attorney.

8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.

9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying 
they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will 
follow up with their attorney.

10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) 
to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation 
as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit 
should be alerted.

11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A 
and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.

12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.

13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an 
ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have 
requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA 
negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.

 

Kendal:
I am still waiting to hear back from them.  I will follow up with them and 
get back to you.

Jack:
Thanks for your e-mail.  I met with our credit people this morning and can 
respond to some of the credit points raised in your May 16th memo:

1. With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our 
credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral 
Threshold definition.  

2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way 
you suggested with  additional language that states that any drop below BBB- 
also counts as a trigger.

3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective 
rate which my credit person is thinking about.

4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that 
your comment is correct.

5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the 
definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.

6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to 
$500,000 and to limit "returns" of collateral to once a week.  We cannot 
agree to change  the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.  Given 
the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market 
change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.

7. With respect to item #14, there is no requirement to escrow cash 
collateral that is being held and the Secured Party is free to do whatever it 
wants to with the cash until the events in 13(g)(ii) occur, in which case the 
cash collateral must be held by a Qualified Institution.

8. With respect to item #19, if we draw the entire amount of the LC and the 
termination amount that we are owed is less than the LC amount, we would be 
required under the documents to return any excess amount to you.  All we are 
doing in an Event of Default situation is converting the LC into cash 
collateral that we hold subject to the terms of the documents.

9. We can agree to make the chnages that you requested in item #18.

I still need some clarification on the point you were making in item #17 and 
I will look at your other comments in today's e-mail and respond shortly.  
Are you okay with the Enron and Inland forms of Guaranty?

One of the things that Organic has asked us to keep confidential is "the 
existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the 
parties as well as any information regarding the skills and compensation of 
employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party."  This is a 
departure from our form.  Are we prepared to agree to this?  Also, to the 
extent that parties are insisting on using their form of CA, what do you want 
the approval process to be?

issue, do you think that Janet Greene's proposed language to the "null and 
void" sentence as well as the drawing certificate works?  I was concerned 
that the language "Event of Default under the Confirm" may lead to some

Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft 
that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:

1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an 
amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral 
provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.  
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop 
the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Kristina, here are the proposed changes to the Assignment Consent Agreement.  
Our attorney is Carol St. Clair .  Please respond to her (and copy me if via 
email) with your response to the proposed changes.  She indicated that we are 
negotiating an amendment to our master with Morgan in order to accommodate 
this assignment so we will not be executing the Assignment Consent Agreement 
until Enron and Morgan sign the amendment to our Master with them.   We need 
to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that 
establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of 
Morgan and MEGA.  She indicated that her revised draft of the Consent makes 
it clearer how this cutoff date works.  Carol's contact information is below.

The following deal confirmations do not contain the product definitions for 
SP-15 delivery (CAISO) and Palo Verde/Mid Columbia (West Firm)

226189 (SP15)
220051 (SP15)
220052 (SP15)
249547 (PV)
200536 (MidC)

Therefore, the amendment will need to contain the definition of CAISO Energy 
and West Firm Energy.

To Rhonda,

My bad...It looks like MEGA is assigning ALL of its physical power positions 
with EPMI to ENA.  The attached spreadsheet below has the options in the 
lower section, which should really be part of the "to be assigned" group.

To All,

Sorry for the confusion,

Wendy

Please find attached a spreadsheet which matches up the MEGA Deals with the 
EPMI deals to be assigned from MEGA to Morgan.  Please review deal numbers 
for accuracy and then review the confirms to ensure that all necessary West 
Product Definitions are either in the confirm.  If they are not in the 
confirm, they need to be identified in the amendment to the Master Agreement 
with Morgan.

Thanks,
Wendy

Jim Crump met with Mike Sullivan and Julie Beck yesterday and it appears as 
if based on the e-mails that we have exchanged that the next step is to have 
a conference call to finalize the ISDA and the remaining open issues.  What I 
plan to do by tomorrow is circulate a redraft of the Schedules.  Julie and 
Mike agreed that David Turpin should partic ipate in the call so that all 
open issues can be resolved.  Could you please contact my assistant, Suzanne 
Adams, at 713-853-7340 and give her some days and times next week that you 
and David are available.  I would think that we would only need an hour.  I 
plan to have Ken Curry, my credit person, with me for the call.  Thanks.

Attached for your review is the latest version of the new master form we have 
been working on.  We have tried to incorporate all of the changes and 
comments we have received in our last three offsite meetings.  We have left 
some questions and open issues in brackets.  I addition, we have highlighted 
some areas for extra attention, some of which are explained below:

Section 1.2:  The term of the master is month to month; each transaction will 
have a specific term, as set forth in the applicable confirmation
Section 1.3:  We need to make a final decision on whether all credit terms 
will be in the master or whether some will be in the confirmation
Section 1.4:  We have made the usage bands monthly by account; this can 
easily be changed if there is business consensus to do so.
Section 2.7:  Instead of utility non-performance (physical or financial) 
being an event of force majeure, we have added a new section addressing 
that.  It provides for a free termination by EES in such event; we need to 
consider whether there should be a payment.
Section 3.1:  subsections (v), (vi) and (vii) need credit review as indicated
Section 3.3:  termination payments are now bilateral (defaulting party gets 
paid if non-defaulting party has a Gain).
Sections 3.6 and 3.7:  Probably can be shortened while keeping the concepts; 
is the first sentence of Sec. 3.7 needed?
Section 3.9:  Need input on highlighted language; need to decide whether we 
want a bilateral early termination payment here.
Special Utility Charges definition: we pass through surcharges here.
Assignment: do we want to give customer right to assign without consent in 
any circumstances (like to an affiliate)?
Confirm: Transaction Term:  need to confirm that this is how we want 
start/end dates to be determined.

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

Attached is the final red-line showing all the changes made to our existing 
large commodity form based on the spot check item in the EES/EWS Coordination 
Plan.  We will drive these changes into all remaining forms (mid-market, CMA, 
Fast-Track and industrial and commercial gas agreements) as well as all 
transactions currently in the beginning or middle stages of negotiation.

On a go forward basis for new transactions, we will identify and explain all 
material deviations from these revised forms.

The following are my comments:

1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.

2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before 
the word "change" and after the word "in".

3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon 
at the end of clause (i).

4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is 
still an open issue.

5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in 
the beginning of the Section.

6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load 
Factor.

7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.

8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?

9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line 
of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word 
"this".

10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I 
will also add granting/perfection language.

11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm 
not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.

12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.

13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).

I would add setoff language.

I spoke with our credit people today.  We would like to arrange a call to
discuss our concerns about Section 5 of the Guaranty with me, our credit
people, your counsel and your credit person or someone that can make a
decision if we propose a change to the Guaranty.  Can you let me know who
these people are (and their phone numbers) so that we can arrange a call?
We understand fully your need for the Section 5 language, but we would like
to explore with your people whether your concerns can be addressed in a
different manner.  Thanks.

Sarah:
What a mess this is.  I need your advice on what I should do.  I was told 
that the only way that I can play on the Rice team is to either play with a 
3.5 man or not to play on my Tuesday night league.  Bill tells me that there 
are no 3.5 men available to add to our roster.  Is that true?  This is really 
a difficult choice for me because I really enjoy playing on the Tuesday night 
team and i still feel that we have a chance to advance further.  What do you 
think I should do?

Hi Carol--I bet your ears have been burning for a couple of days!  This is 
the part of tennis that I really don't like.  I've had numerous email 
conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist.  
Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest.  One 
of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation, 
and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would 
have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season.  This 
evidently happened to her team two years ago.  (I think she's rationalizing 
after-the-fact.)

You probably know that this person--that lodged the "protest"--is Betsie 
Hollis.  She's my women's team captain.  I've called her on the carpet about 
this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is 
hurting me, too.  She did try to withdraw her "protest," but Cheryl had 
evidently already taken action.  There are so many people out there that are 
mis-ranked.  The fellow playing with Kelly last Sunday should not be a 
3.5...the woman we played against should not be a 3.5...Elise Shepherd should 
not be a 4.5...and on and on.  I have heard through Roger White--Rice U's 
womens coach and a USTA verifier--that they are slowly trying to rectify 
mis-rankings by looking more closely at league and tournament results.  I 
think you may be the first casualty of this endeavor.

Bill Hunt has all sorts of counter-arguments.  He had Cheryl's approval to 
play you in mixed at 4.0.  Maybe if we promise to play you with our weaker 
4.0 men--who are borderline 3.5 material--they'd let it pass.  Who knows.  If 
we are going to lose you--and Chris after this week--we're going to be pretty 
weak, not to mention demoralized.

After all, we're all just trying to have some fun on the tennis court.  
Speaking of which, this Sunday is Chris' last match before his big move to 
North Carolina.  We're out at Lee LeClear.  I don't remember if you or Bill 
are scheduled to play, but please join us for a little send-off celebration 
after the match if you can.

Jack:
Enclosed is a new draft of the Schedules marked against the previous draft.  
I believe that this draft responds to most of the issues raised in your 
e-mails.  Just a few additional thoughts:

1. Since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this 
Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts between the 
Confirms and the Agreement are resolved in favor of the Confirm.  I think 
that the language as written works.

2. On the setoff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only 
pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so I don't see how 
this language would impact any agreements between ENA and guaranty Bank 
unless Inland is the Non-Defaulting party.

3. With respect to Disruption Fallbacks, our view is that if the Confirm 
specifies a Fallback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use 
that price if available.  I think that the language works as drafted.

4. On cash collateral, the Qualified institution concept only applies when 
the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the 
threshold.  Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the collateral and do 
whatever it wants to with it.  Your are correct that in practice this cash 
gets commingled with corporate funds and swept into the party's bank account 
but there is no requirement taht it work that way.

We look forward to having a call with your group next week.  Please e-mail me 
with some days and times so that I can alert our people.  thanks.

Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:

1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?

2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone 
and not necessarily followed up in writing and that this is the practice.  
Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?

Carol, 
The west desk is presently working on a deal to serve a large industrial 
customer, Knauf,  newly located within the franchise area of a tiny northern 
California municipality, The City of Shasta Lake.  It makes sense to do a 
price swap with Knauf.  Our champion, Laird Dyer, says that Knauf wants to do 
an ISDA.  This would be a perfect situation for you, with your ISDA 
background, to help me, (working on the corresponding physical piece with the 
City of Shasta) to team up and help us get this deal done.  Can you help us 
in this manner?  ----cgy  

Christian,

Can you please forward the ISDA to Jeff Brown at Knauf Fiber Glass G m b H.

Paul:
Just a few questions for you on the revised EEI master that we received from 
Engage today:

1. I just want to confirm that the collateral thresholds should be 9 million.

2. They want to have Section 8.1(b) and 8.2(b) apply which requires a party 
to post collateral if the other party believes that its creditworthiness is 
unsatisfactory.

2. In our Schedule, we delete the 3 day cure period for an event of default 
that occurs as a result of a Guarantor's non-payment.  They want the cure 
period.  do you care?

3. In Section 5.7, each party can suspend performance if a Potential Event of 
Default or an Event of Default occurs. They want to delete Potential Event of 
Default.

4. They want to extend the right to dispute invoices and to request 
adjustments to statements or payments from 12 months to 18 months.

5. They want to change the consent to assignments standard from being able to 
withhold consent in one's sole discretion to being able to withhold consent 
only when it is reasonable to do so.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Keith:
I am okay with the arbitration and non-exclusive jurisdiction language as 
currently written as I understand that these concepts were previously agreed 
to between you and Mary.  Here is my understanding of the remaining open 
issues:

1. Whther termination is automatic or elective on bankruptcy.  You are 
considering our request to make it elective.

2. Loss vs. Market Quotation.  We are considering whther we can accept your 
proposed language.

3. Time period for posting collateral.  You are considering how long you need.

4. Cash collateral.    I am checking with our office in Canada about this.

5. MAC clause - you are considering whther this should be an Additional 
Termination Event with the ability to cure by posting collateral or an event 
that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.

6. Default rate definition -  Ed is considering what we can accept in lieu of 
the ISDA definition.

7. No Fault Termination - we are considering whether we can accept this.

8. Credit thresholds and Rounding amounts - you and Ed to discuss.

9. Acceptable LC Issuers - Ed to consider whther limiting it to US and 
Schedule 1Canadian banks with a certain credit rating is sufficient with 
language that the parties can agree to add foreign banks.

Let me know if I misstated and of the above issues.  Thanks.

of the counterparty visits taht are occurring, should we send to the group a

Carol, the last time we spoke, I believe you were going to talk to Mark
about accepting revisions to 2(g) and 4  and advise if we could use an
amended ETA rather than the letter of amendments. (see my note of June 6).
To close this matter, I suggest I send you the ETA later today or Wed with
the revisions we requested and include the changes you made that we agreed
with. I will also include a cover letter we would both sign that once we
'click' the ETA is executed, but not the one on screen ,but the one attached
to the letter agreement.

Thank you for your help, and trust this is the easiest way to close this
file.

Just wanted to update you on the call that I had this morning with Jose and 
Pablo.  As a general matter, I think that we are going to be okay with 
offering physical and financial derivative products to Mexican counterparties 
online.  They are in the process of reviewing the online documents and will 
get back to me sometime next week with any thoughts or recommendations.  One 
area that we will need to be careful in is in how we market Enron Online for 
there are restrictions in connection with the offering of "securities".  
While it is fairly clear that commodity based derivatives are not securities  
there may be other products where it is not so clear cut.  I think that it 
would be very helpful if you would send to Jose and Pablo the Online 
materials (i.e, brochures etc.) that we would plan to send to prospective 
counterparties so that we can make sure that our marketing efforts don't 
violate any restrictions taht we would be subject to.

Pablo and Jose:
Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received 
from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going 
forward with their marketing efforts?  If so, please advise.  Prior to 
receiving you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe 
on Wednesday of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least 
outline any potential online issues, both in connection with our marketing 
efforts and in connection with the online documents that you are reviewing? I 
am available anytime after 2:30 (Houston time) on Wednesday and I am wide

Why don't you go ahead and send over your CSA form?  I think the idea here
is to have it fully negotiated in advance.  As to the idea of just using
S&P, I will pass that along to our Treasury Dept.

Mike

  -----Original Message-----
  Mike:
  I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves,
our credit person, and
  we are okay with the concept except that we would like for
the ratings trigger
  to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a
failure to have an S&P
  rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we
put in place a CSA,
  that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral
threshold:

  BB to BB+  $2,500,000
  Below BB  Zero

  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our
form of Credit
  Support Annex?

I am okay with these changes so long as we make clear to them that by 
agreeing to take out arbitration we are not setting a precedent with them 
with respect to any future agreements (i.e., ISDA Master etc.) that we intend 
to enter into with them.  Please let me see the agreement as I think that if 
we go back to our non-arbitration language, there is other language that 
needs to be added.

Could you please update me on where things stand as I will be on my leave

Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of=20
Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is=20
reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.

What=01,s Different?
? Your =01+home=01, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay adv=
ice.=20
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial module=
s=20
of SAP.

? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P=01, represent earning t=
ypes=20
reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time f=
or=20
the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay=20
advice as =01+PVacation=01,.

? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instea=
d=20
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions wil=
l=20
remain itemized in the deduction section.

? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-=
date=20
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the=20
year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This=
=20
change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your=
=20
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year=
=20
will reflect your earnings by company).

? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick=
=20
day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the=
=20
related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary=01, earnings type.=

? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll=

contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555

Payroll FAQ=01,s

My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan=
d for?
There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For=
=20
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an=
d=20

f all=20
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane=
t=20
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected =
in=20
the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the=20
July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay ad=
vice=20
as =01+POvertime=01,.

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit =
is=20
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to=20
another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou=
nt=20
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC=
A=20
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock=
=20
options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This=
=20
can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form=20

Brant
Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.

1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok 
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing 
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are 
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently 
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a 
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its 
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When 
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all 
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master 
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the 
Enron Guaranty be for?

Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this.  
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.

Carol --

John Puett, Duke Energy Corporation, wonders if Duke Energy can discontinue 
contract as stated in 6.a, which states that EnronOnline can terminate 
contract.  
Will you please call John (704-382-4061) regardng this question?

Thanks, Carol, and have a wonderful weekend.
Mary "Griff" Gray

David:
GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:

1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the 
legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the 
second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf 
of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper 
exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the 
Website password?]

2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a 
similar indemnity.

I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1?

Carol

Richard:
Do you have any thoughts on this?
Carol
Carol St Clair
04/28/2000 01:47 PM
Richard:
Could you please take a look at point #6.  This is the online counterparty 
who had requested in their arbitration language that only monetary damages 
are available as a remedy in any arbitration proceeding and that under no 
circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against 
them.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

carol
Carol:
My comments are shown in CAPS below.  Once we have agreed on the edits to
the Online Agreement, I am assuming that you will provide a revised version
of the agreement for me to review -- is that correct?  I should be able to
respond very quickly once our final power rates record of decision is sent
to the printer (May 5).  Thanks.
Joyce

Joyce:
Per my earlier e-mail message, I have had a chance to discuss your proposed
arbitration language with our litigation manager.  We can accept your
proposed
new language with the following chnages:

1.   From our language in the ETA, we need to keep in the provisions
regarding
treble, exemplary and punitive damages.  This is Enron's current policy.  I
ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE SENTENCE:  "ONLY DAMAGES ALLOWED PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE AWARDED AND THE ARBITRATORS SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO
AWARD TREBLE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND/OR THE FAA OR AAA."  THIS IS OK AND CAN BE
INCLUDED IN MY SUGGESTED DISPUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PARAGRAPH THAT ADDRESSES
REMEDIES.

2.   In the first paragraph of your language, we would like to delete the
last
sentence.  THIS IS OK.

3.   With respect to the selection of the arbitrators, we would like to keep
our
language that each party can select 1.  We have no problem going with your
language on selecting the third from a list.  THIS IS OK.

4.   We cannot agree that monetary damages are the exclusive remedy.  How
would
we enforce the confidentiality provisions?   We need some other way to be
able
to seek non-monetary remedies for those types of breaches.  THIS MAY BE OUR
ONLY STICKING POINT.    GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A
BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.  IN A BREACH OF CONTRACT
CLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION
(28 U.S.C. 1491).  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED FOR SUCH
RELIEF.  [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSED
DISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.]
SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL
CLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.  BONNEVILLE
IS NOT AMENABLE TO (NOR MAY IT BE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO) ENTER INTO
CONTRACTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ARBITRATORS WITH AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT WHICH
CONGRESS INTENDED TO BE APPLICABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.

I CANNOT ASCERTAIN FROM YOUR COMMENT WHETHER YOUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT
BONNEVILLE IS A FEDERAL AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT.  IF THAT IS YOUR CONCERN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE
ADDED TO YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF
COMFORT THAT INFORMATION THAT ENRON DEEMS CONFIDENTIAL IS NOT DISCLOSED
WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENRON TO RESPOND:

"SUBJECT TO BONNEVILLE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5
U.S.C. 552, AS AMENDED), THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), THE TRADE
SECRETS ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1905), AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS,
BONNEVILLE SHALL TREAT AS EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ANY TRADE SECRETS
AND COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
PROVIDED THAT IT IS PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL AND IS SO DESIGNATED BY
ENRON.  IN THE EVENT A THIRD PARTY SEEKS DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, BONNEVILLE SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY ENRON OF
SUCH EFFORT, AND ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENRON TO PROTEST SUCH DISCLOSURE.
BONNEVILLE SHALL USE ITS REASONABLE EFFORTS TO AVOID DISCLOSURE OF ANY
PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION."

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments:

1. Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity 
test.

2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in 
our Schedule

3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it 
a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a 
Baa3 rating by Moody's.

4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a 
requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we 
make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank 
regulatory authorities

5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option 
transactions.

6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation 
of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event 
Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to "matured and unmatured" 
obligations.

7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty

8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that 
have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method 
works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appears 
to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would 
have to make to the Defaulting Party.

I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them 
about this next week.

Stacy:
I left on your chair the commnets to the amendment agreements.  Could you 
please confirm with Lisa that it makes sense to have the additional 
bankruptcy termination enevts as "automatic" triggers in your document when 
in the fianncial master it is drafted as an election.  Please e-mail the 
revised agreement to KCS' counsel - Zachary May and copy Harry Stout.  
Zachary's e-mail is zachary.may@weil.com and Harry Stout's is 
hls@KCSEnergy.com.  Thanks and call me if you have any questions.

Rhett:
We are in the process of negotiating an ISDA with this counterparty which is 
a German Bank and is not a Multibranch Party.  We just received their 
comments to our ISDA Schedule and they raised the following tax issues:

1. They have deleted the Section 3(f) rep in our Schedule and inserted 
"none". 

2. In our tax forms section, they have deleted our language and added 
language that only requires them to give to us a Form 4224 in connection with 
payments received by them under the ISDA that are attributable to the conduct 
of a business in the US.

3. They have modified the definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" to include taxes 
imposed as a result of a Change in Tax Law by an authority in the 
jurisdiction of the payee, unless the payor is located in such jurisdiction .

I will send you their mark-up but I need your advice on how to handle these 
comments.  Thanks.

Carol, from the way this sounds, your four weeks goes on into the 26 weeks as 
long as your doctor hasn't released you.  What do you think.  Man, this stuff 
is hard to decifer!

Under doctors care, the employee is paid 4 wks at 100% of their base, granted 
that no sick time has been taken prior to the maternity leave.  If the doctor 
requires her to be off work before her due date, this time would be coded as 
sick.  Even after delivery and still under doctors care you would code her 
sick time.  until the doctor releases her to return to work.  Once she has 
been released by the doctor Carol has the option to take time off using any 
vacation available or could take FMLA leave (if  she qualifies )  with 
supervisor approval.

Carmen, I understand that Carol will get her 4 weeks sick pay for having the 
baby and then whatever vacation she wants to take, but what does the doctor 
need to do to extend her into the 26 weeks of 90% pay.  She's already 
starting to have problems, so I'm sure she's not going to be able to return 
to work after 4 weeks.  I need details on how to address this issue.  Thanks,

Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
"materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to 
"netting".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

We currently have the following outstanding confirmations with Duke:

1. Duke Energy Marketing Ltd. Partnership (Canada)    601 confirmations

We were delayed in calling this c/p because ECC was forwarding an 'approved'
list of c/p for us to contact. Duke is on the 'approved' list.

I faxed a list of outstanding confirms to Manolo recently, and am calling him 
today to follow-up.
Manolo Martinez may be contacted at 403-297-9889.

2. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing (Houston) 321 confirmations

Theresa Copeland has been my contact at 713-260-8540.
In late 99/early 00, she said that an arrangement was made with Diane Swiber 
whereby Duke didn't need to sign or send confirmations back to us, but the 321
above represents financial deals only.

Theresa said that if there are any discrepancies with any confirmations, that 
Duke is able
to mark any changes on the confirmations, and fax these back to us within 48 
hours,

If you would, briefly discuss your history with Duke,

I met with David Dupre to discuss issues relating to unsigned confirms and 
apparently Williams is one of our biggest offenders.  Do you know why they 
are not signing?  Also, are we planning on talking about this next Friday?

Russell:
Our confirms desk has informed me that Aquila Risk Management has not been 
executing confirmations that are sent to them and apparently the reason for 
this was that they ere waiting for the Utilicorp Master to be put in place.  
Now that we have completed the Master, is there some way that we can get 
these confirms executed?  I will send you a list of deals shortly, but I'm 
assuming that given the language that we have in the Master that there should 
be no problem in signing the existing confirms that reference the existing 
Aquila Master.  I look forward to hearing from you.

correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I 
think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such 
failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the 
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals? 

3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.

Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that 
much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all 
counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have 
asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding 
exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues 
to cover on Friday involve:

1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard 
langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to 
whether NY or Texas law applies.

2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.  
For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a 
list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree 
with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.

3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.

I'm available anytime to talk about the above.

I have reviewed the last Transaction Document List produced by Milbank on
April 7  ( the "TDL" ) and suggest that the documents referenced below will
need to be in pretty close to final shape before we mail the preliminary
offering memo.  Since many of these documents need to be agreed between DLJ
and Enron and then between Enron and the "Equity," we should probably get
started on these documents as soon as possible.  We have seen drafts of some
of these docs, but not most.

Using the TDL as a reference, these documents are items I.1., I.2., I.3.,
I.4., II.A.1.-5. and 7., C.1.1.1-1.4., 1.7, 1.8. and 1.10 and all of C.12.

Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark-up with our thoughts on this 
since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the 
Revolver.  Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor.  My 
objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this 
language and that this deal does not create a new standard.

Rod and Brant:
I finally received their revised draft of the Schedules.  They are still 
insisting on an Additional Termination Event that gets triggered if there is 
a MAC.  As defined, MAC means a rating that is below BBB- OR Baa3 or failure 
to have a rating from either S&P OR Moody's.  I need your guidance on this.  
MAC as defined in the CSA  which triggers the threshold going to zero works 
the same way.  I seem to recall that from a credit standpoint, we were okay 
with a MAC that would be triggered if either rating fell.  Is that correct?

Carol

Rob:
Thanks for your redraft.  I'm checking with my credit folks on the MAC 
termination event.  As soon as I hear from them, I will send you my comments 
and we can discuss any remaining open items but I think that we are close.

The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments:

1. Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity 
test.

2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in 
our Schedule

3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it 
a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a 
Baa3 rating by Moody's.

4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a 
requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we 
make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank 
regulatory authorities

5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option 
transactions.

6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation 
of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event 
Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to "matured and unmatured" 
obligations.

7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty

8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that 
have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method 
works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appears 
to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would 
have to make to the Defaulting Party.

about this next week.

Russell:
Since late 1998, we have been trying to put in place a Master between ENA and 
the above counterparty.  We currently have a Master dated July 1997 between 
ECC and Pancanadian Petroleum Limited and Pancanadian wants to pretty much 
duplicate this Master.  Here are the credit terms of the late 1998 drfat that 
we sent them which I need for you to tell me are still okay:

No Credit Support Providers
Cross Default - $50,000,000 for ENA and $25,000,000 for them
Additional Event of Default - occurrence of a MAC and the failure to provide 
Perfprmance Assurance in accordnace with annex A.  MAC is defined as 
 Enron's rating going below BBB- and their Net Worth falling below 
$133,000,000 opr their Funded Debt to Net Worth being more than 1 to 1
They want to defined the "control" concept in Affiliate as ownership of more 
than 50% of equity.  This term is used in the Setoff language and limits the 
possible  entities that could be Affiliates on our side and their side
Forms of collateral are cash and LC's
Collateral Thresholds are $10,000,000 for us and $3,500,000 for them

Let me know what you think.

     Appreciate if you can add yur commnets as discussed last week so we
     can then proceed as soon as possible

     Thanks

______________________________ Forward Header 
__________________________________
     Frank,

     To follow up on our conversation earlier this week I'd like to confirm
     my understanding of how the terms on Enron-online will work.

     1.Enron-online is a medium for executing a transaction with Enron...an
     electronic method just as phone is a verbal method

  Yes    

 2.Financial trades in North American will be traded with Enron North
      America.
      Physical trades in US will be with Enron NA other than in Texas where
      is will be Houston Pipeline Company(please can you clarify this aspect
      for gas moving out of Texas on interstate pipelines)
      Physical trades in Canada will be with Enron Canada

 The first sentence is correct.  Physical NATURAL GAS trades in US will be 
     3.All financial deals will be governed by the cargill/Enron ISDA
     agreement presently being negotiated

 Once executed, the ISDA signed be Cargill and Enron will govern any 
financial trades entered into by the   entities that signed this agreement.

     4.Physical deals will be governed by the executed GISB agreement in
     place
 
 Physical NATURAL GAS deals, entered into by the entities that executed a 
GISB agreement, will be governed by  said agreement. 

     5.Cargill will need to have two accounts to differentiate Cargill Inc
     from Cargill Canada

 Yes
 

     Given the above summary, Cargill will look to set up two accounts as
     per (5) above, to commence trading with Enron-online.

     If you have any comments on above or can speed the setting up of our
     accounts, please feel free to e.mail me back today

     Regards

Frank:
I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can 
verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos 
state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed 
by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada 
on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master 
as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same 
counterparty for ENA and ECC.

Carol

Rod:
I found my file and here is where things stand:

1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the 
collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at 
$100,000.

2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept 
quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct 
term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these 
statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is 
that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days 
after quarter end.

3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.

4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and 
if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to 
have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners 
Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:

Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus 
capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.

Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all 
proper income charges, including taxes on income.

Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products. 

Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these 
definitions?

5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.

This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Could you help me review this?  I thought that given your review of some of 
the other agreements that you might have some helpful suggestions about what 
to look out for from our standpoint.  I have sent a copy of this to Mark 
Holsworth.  Thanks.  If we need to sit down with Mark Tawney and ask him 
questions about what this should cover, let me know.

Susan:
I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to 
Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go 
back to our old language.

Sara and Mark:
Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language 
where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can "hold" 
collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our 
counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds 
the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on 
this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a 
Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let 
me know what you think.
Carol

Rob:
I am faxing to you our comments to the latest drafts of Schedules.  Our 
credit person has agreed to make the MAC trigger as an additional Termination 
Event so long as (1) we limit the trigger to the S&P rating; (2) we provide a 
cure concept that the non-Affected Party controls subject to a cap; and (3) 
we remove the MAC trigger from the collateral threshold definition.  I have 
included some proposed language.  Also, with respect to the partnership 
agreement, I seem to recall that you were reluctant to send us a copy as we 
traditionally review LP agreements as a part of our due diligence.  Is that 
still the case?  I like what you did on the Termination Event but we need 
some comfort that you cannot alter or narrow the GP's liability that is 
provided by statute.  Could you please give that some thought and we can talk 
further about it?

Tomorrow is bad for me to talk but the rest of the week after tomorrow looks 
good if you have some time.
Carol

Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following 
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Carol

Nedre:
Per your request, here is what we have decided:

1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned 
to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but 
until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to 
her.

2. We have passed on the following candidates:

Stephanie Panus
Patricia Slaughter
Donald Duhon
Debra Vincent

Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest  
to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie 
Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It 
would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over 
candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send 
their resume elsewhere.

Also, do you have references for Samantha? 

Please call me if you need any additional information.

Carol

Shari:

I need your thoughts on 2 things:

We have done another trade with this counterparty on the Omnibus form and 
Jaryd informed me that as part of the first trade, we agreed to some 
modifications to our Annex A.  Do you remember what those modifications 
were?  Also, we are now using our new form of Annex A.  How do you think that 
this counterparty will react to getting a new form?  I loook forward to 
hearing from you.

Carol

Nedre:
To the extent that she gives us references from her current employer (and I 
hope that she will) can one of us talk to them as well?

The assignment looks fine, but I don't understand the underlying 
transaction.  Is EEL transferring this domain name "WEATHER-DESK.COM" without 
any consideration other than using RMS' software program for six months?

Here is what I have found out from our credit and confirms people.  We are

John:
I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the 
ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you 
were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the 
Schedules:

1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.  I'm not sure 
I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of 
the language and wanted your thoughts on this.  Alos, does the second part of 
the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?

2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.

3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which 
makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of 
Default trigger.  Should we specify a threshold?

4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual 
ratings triggers.  For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services 
that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this 
additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I 
don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger 
for that to go to zero is something else.

5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a 
Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.

6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I think 
is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.

7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000.

Please call me when convenient to discuss further.

I don't like specifying a time period for termination. I remember we had a

Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with

the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?

have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

Carol,

Some of the data sets we receive on a regular basis from the National Weather 
Service are not 100% complete.  i.e., a day or two of data may be missing 
from the data set.  In some cases, an entire month of data (temperatures, 
rainfall, and/or snowfall) may be missing.  For our internal purposes, our 
research group uses analytical tools to determine a "best guess" at what the 
actual data was.  We replace the blanks in our files with our best guesses.  
We usually highlight derived data in our files, but we cannot be sure that we 
have highlighted derived data in every case.

A customer is requesting some historical data from us.  We would like to send 
this data to them, but I am concerned about the legal liability of 
misrepresenting our analysis as fact.  What do we need to do to absolve 
ourselves of any liability in this regard?

Please call with any questions.

Would you like me to give him the information??? 
 I've given him Raleigh and St. Louis  in the past because we had deals with 
Inergy in those cities. 
 We currently have NO active deals with Inergy.

Lucy,

I work with Bill Gautreaux at Inergy Services.  I am working on several
proposals in which historical degree day averages are needed.  Would you
be able to provide the 10 yr, 15 yr, 20 yr and 30 degree day averages
(ending with calendar 1999) for the following locations.

Raliegh, NC
Chattanooga, TN
Fort Wayne, IN
Chicago, IL
Detroit, MI

You have recently provided us with some of the information above, but I
am missing several components.

I can be reached at 816-741-5080 if you have any questions.

I appreciate your help in providing the information.

According to Bruce Mills in our group,

We have contacted Merrill Lynch Captial Services to retrieve our outstanding

They have indicated that they want the fixed price (nymex) language changed 
to reflect

immediately
and refaxed to them.

Please advise,

As we discussed, here is a draft of a proposed amendment letter which covers 
the issues that we talked about.  Depending upon how Leslie handles the

Carol,

I need to fill you in on the new structure. Essentially the senior debt will 
now be Corp guaranteed and on balance sheet. The swap adjustments will 
therefore impact equity only.

We are now projecting financial close as the week of June 19th - the week I 
go on holiday!. That means preliminary offering memo for the guaranteed notes 
going out around the last week of May. By then, everything has to be 
finalised (including the swap).

Hope this helps your planning. 

All is well and will be better when Margaux closes. 

All the best with being a mum again!

     Mark

   Carol St Clair                10/05/2000 15:28

Mark:
Can you give me a sense of when you think Margaux will close?  The only 
reason I'm asking is because I will be taking maternity leave at some point 
in time in the next 2-21/2 months and I want to make sure that if necessary, 
I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well.

the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master 
and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken 
with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also 
have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

Alicia and Trina:
Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the swap docs:

Put Confirm

1. Looks like some type of price protection mechanism is contemplated in the 
Master Derivatives Agreement and I'm assuming it would go into this confirm
2. In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments 
and supplements

Harrier/Talon Schedule

1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13
2. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the 
Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be 
drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens 
when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc.

3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that 
Talon/Enron Schedule

1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of 
Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added?
2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule?
3. Same comments as above

Master Derivatives Agreement

1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the 
$400,000,000 limitation?  For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should 
be reversed.

Talon Note

1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to 
Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule applies since the setoff rights only 
benefit Enron and its affiliates.  Also,  what does it mean to refer to the 
Enron Guaranty here?

Enron Guaranty

1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setoff only 
apply to the Guaranteed Agreements and unless I'm missing something, I think 
we can give on that point.

That's all that I have.  Have you discussed with Ben the point that we talked 
about last week concerning the difference between the calculation of "Net 
Talon Loss" versus "Loss"?

I'm available tomorrow to talk about these points.
Carol

Susan:
What is the status of this?  I would like to see a draft of the assignment 
and Termination Agreement soon.  Can you please prepare something for review 
sometime Monday?  Thanks.

Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.

1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok 
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing 
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are 
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently 
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a 
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its 
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When 
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all 
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master 
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the 
Enron Guaranty be for?

Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this.  
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.

I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can

state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed 
by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada 
on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master 
as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same 
counterparty for ENA and ECC.

Dave:
1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is 
part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't 
sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.

2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their 
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own 
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I 
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided

Adele:
Tanya left a message for Cindy and offerred $10M as a cap for each Guaranty.  
The reason for the cushion is to protect the party who terminates at a time 
when its exposure is close to the credit threshold and by the time that the 
date is set and the amount is calculated there is a move in the market that 
results in its exposure being above the threshold.

Carol

	David Forster@ENRON
	05/12/2000 02:56 PM
		
As long as our omission by way of (for example) not having high enough 
security is not enough to impact the liability clause, then I guess I am OK 
with this - but I'd be happier if it did not include "omission"

i.e. If we are stupid and hurt ourselves, then shame on us, but if we simply 
do not take some action and thereby fail to prevent the Counterparty from 
inflicting damage on us, then that is something different.

Thoughts?

Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective 
date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make 
absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by 
ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective 
date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the 
Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks.  
Thanks.
Carol

Brant:
Their lawyer finally called me.  We have a few open credit issues on our side 
that I need for you to think about:

1. Are you okay with the cross default threshold on both sides being 3% of 
stockholders' equity?  They didn't like $100,000,000.

2. For corporate policy reasons, they cannot take advantage of affiliate 
setoff.  Since I wasn't sure what relationships ENA and its affiliates had 
with this counterparty, I wasn't sure how strongly you felt about it.  Please 
advise.

Carol 

Karen:
Please take a look at what we have agreed to in Section 4(b) of the 
amendment.  Your new language does not track that language and if you are 
going to add language to the LC it needs to track that language.  I 
personally feel that this language is unnecessary so long as the drawing 
condition is specified.
Carol

Carol:

The additional transfer language is sufficient.

I black lined an insert to address TEFP's concern that the letter of credit 
may be exercised on
default, only when funds are owed.

Please advise if this change is acceptable to Enron.  (If it is, I will print 
copies of the
attached, & replace the existing letter of credit format with the attached 
document, so that
Susan does not have to generate executions copies again.)

Thank you,

Karen

John:
Our credit person has agreed to the 3% equity test for cross-default.  With 
respect to setoff, given our relationships with El Paso, this is an important 
credit point for us and one that I guess the credit people will need to 
discuss since it is important for us to have the Affiliate language.  Our 
credit person is Brant Reves (713-853-9897).

Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.  Since we are still 
confirming deals under ARMS, does the effective date on the Transfer and 
Termination Agreement work?  I want to make sure that it covers all trades 
that have been confirmed with ARMS until we start confirming with Utilicorp.  
Please advise.

Carol,

Not yet.  The master agreement documents were sent out by FED EX on Monday, 
May 8th.

As for the effective date of the (a) Master Agreement and (b) Transfer and 
Termination Agreement, both documents were given an effective date of May 3, 
2000.

Susan:
Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective 
date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make 
absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by 
ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective 
date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the 
Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks.  
Thanks.

On the recording language issue, we can agree to the following:  Instead of 
limiting it to trading, marketing and scheduling personnel, we can agree that 
it is limited to all telephone communications that are made to or from each 
party's trading floor. This is because all calls that originate out of our 
trading area are always recorded no matter who picks up on the other line.   
Does that work for you?  I'm still checking on the confirmation/transaction 
tape issue.  Also, our credit person will agree to the Moody's trigger in the 
MAC language that we discussed.

David:
Thanks for your e-mail.  With respect to one of your points, we have in the 
past agreed to modify Section 4(b) of the ETA by adding the following at the 
end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or 
omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or 
contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC 
trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement" 
and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before 
trading.  Are the rules different in Australia?
Carol

Dave:
I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our 
exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with 
this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around 
this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online.

is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol,

I need to fill you in on the new structure. Essentially the senior debt will 
now be Corp guaranteed and on balance sheet. The swap adjustments will 
therefore impact equity only.

We are now projecting financial close as the week of June 19th - the week I 
go on holiday!. That means preliminary offering memo for the guaranteed notes 
going out around the last week of May. By then, everything has to be 
finalised (including the swap).

Hope this helps your planning. 

All is well and will be better when Margaux closes. 

All the best with being a mum again!

     Mark

   Carol St Clair                10/05/2000 15:28

Mark:
Can you give me a sense of when you think Margaux will close?  The only 
reason I'm asking is because I will be taking maternity leave at some point 
in time in the next 2-21/2 months and I want to make sure that if necessary, 
I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well.
Carol

The head of our Online group reviewed the letter that I sent to you last week

Jim:
At long last, enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter that addresses 
the termination issue.  Since the last draft, we have had new procedures in 
place that require all amendments to be approved by the head of our Online 
group.  This review process resulted in several chnages to the draft that I 
previously sent you, namely:

1. We cannot agree in Section 3(e) to change the word "may" to "shall", due 
in part to the fact that we are looking into doing paperless trades online.

2. In the amendment to section 4(b), he has asked that we delete any 
reference to omissions.

I apologize for this.  Please call me after you have had a chance to review 
this.

later than the end of the day Thursday given that we are going to be away.  I 
will let her know that you may be asking her to help.  I would alos want

Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change 
the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the 
following:

"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities

attached.  Is this something that we can agree to?

"danger" zone.  The baby is in the right position now and is a little over 4 
pounds so I am very, very happy and relieved.  Your good vibes are working.  
I'll see my other doctor on Thursday and confirm everything with him but if 
Ric sees me now on the treadmill at the club, tell him not to worry!  (Just 
kidding - I'm not sure I could run now even if I wanted to).  talk to you 
soon.

P.S. - How can I find out about where I stand currently re unused vacation 
time?

Carol, I wasn't able to open the images you attached to your email, but both
the ISDA and the Transfer and Termination Agreement are dated May 3, 2000.
The only possible concern would be those transactions that we are entering
into between May 3 and the day that the UtiliCorp ISDA is executed, at which
time we will actually enter into trades as UtiliCorp.  However, I believe
that we have worded the Transfer and Termination Agreement in such a manner
that, once such document is executed, all trades done as ARM will fall under
the UtiliCorp ISDA, so there shouldn't be any concerns.

I anticipate having the ISDA Transfer and Termination Agreement executed
within the week.  Feel free to let me know if you you have further
questions/concerns.

Russell:
Thanks for your message.  I will take a look at the Transfer Agreement.  I 
just want to make sure that all trades done after May 3rd and before the 
execution date that are being confirmed under ARMS will be transferred to 
Utilicorp.  Alos, in order to change our online system, we need to know when 
the Utilicorp Master will be the operative document so that on and after such 
date, all deals are confirmed under the Master under the Utilicorp name.  Do 
you think that it would be better just to change the effective date of the 
Master and the Transfer Agreement to the date of Utilicorp's execution of the 
Master?

the UtiliCorp ISDA, so there shouldn't be any concerns.

I anticipate having the ISDA Transfer and Termination Agreement executed
within the week.  Feel free to let me know if you you have further
questions/concerns.

Adele and Maria:
Here are my final comments:

1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day 
waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes 
effective?

2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.

3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like 
what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.

4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs 
to UCP.

That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the 
Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final 
versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your 
opinion shortly.

I agree with you.  I had thought about waiting to execute the Transfer
Agreement until after we had executed the new ISDA and (and thus were doing
all subsequent trades as UtiliCorp) and dating the Transfer Agreement
accordingly.  I think it is a more legally sound way of handling the whole
issue.  Why don't you wait until I send you the fully executed ISDA and we
have the correct name in your Enron Online database, and then redate and
send the Transfer Agreement?

Rob:
I'll do my best to get back to you tomorrow although I still have not heard 
from my credit person.  Other than the credit issue, I do want to talk to you 
about the following:

1. Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)(c).  If we have to choose 
between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much 
rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.

2. In the new language that you added in the "Recording" section, I don't 
think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make 
it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is 
made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.  Also, at the very 
beginning where it says "that originates from and" the word "and" needs to be 
"or" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is 
not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.

3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word "herein" 
to "this Agreement" and please change the last reference to "the Existing 
Transactions" to "this Agreement" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.

4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change 
the word "either" to "both" and the word "or" to "and", as I thought this is 
what we agreed to.

5. In the form of LC, our credit group has asked us to add language that 
amends Section 13(b) of the UCP to shorten the time frame from 7 to 3 days 
and I will fax that to you.

I will be tied up until late morning but otherwise available.

 Some of these references are in carveouts where they can only help
us, but in other places they seem problematic.  I think we need to focus on
the definition of Debt and how the references to balance sheets,
particularly the reference to Consolidated balance sheets, may capture
obligations of Principal Subsidiaries we thought we were avoiding?  Do you
have an example of a definition of Debt for use in an Enron cross-default
provision that doesn't reference Principal Ssubsidiaries?

As promised, here is an update of the deals we have planned to close this 
quarter:  

1. We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0 
structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound 
completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if 
the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that 
the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using 
the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st. 

2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in 
the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of 
an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close 
around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31 
transaction to Sara today.

That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals.   
Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any 
other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.

Call if you need any more info.  I will make sure you are on the distribution 
list for docs.

Thanks,

:"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged

Dear Carol -

Enclosed are drafts of (i) the ISDA schedule, (ii) Paragraph 13 to the
Credit Support Annex, and (iii) our standard guarantee.   Also included is a
draft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.

Please note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current
issues would more easily be seen in the draft.

Comments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:  Note - our legal
council is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now,
and we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal department
review next week.

1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant
Reves, they decided to make the cross default threshold at $100MM for each
credit support provider.
2.  1(h):  Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will
apply for 3 years or less; Loss for over 3 years.
3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word
"obligations" in para B, 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning
affiliates.  I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on
my 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do
you think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is
out most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can
execute.
4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it
to just trading staff and (b) adding "to the extent permitted by applicable
law".
5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement.
However, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the
adding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is.
6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I
have no objections to your changes
7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even
though we don't normally use Independent Amounts.
8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your
request.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position
of the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured
party attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is
within 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the
L/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since
Enron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does
your position improve based on this change?
8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM
and Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).

For questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.

Thanks!

John

I need your help in answering the following questions:

EL PASO

Is the collateral threshold for both of us $50,000,000?
What are the Guaranty caps?
Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000?
Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it 
apply to the parties and their credit support providers?

OCCIDENTAL

Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?

Please advise.

I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday to meet, particularly in light of 
the luncheon with your group that we are having.  Is that okay with you?  In 
the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master 
and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken 
with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also 
have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:

1. Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to 
Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP);
2. Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy 
and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.

Here is what I need to know from you:

1. Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these 
trades?  If so, please fax me a copy.

2. Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing 
Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master?

Please advise.

Carol - Here are new Gtys showing the changes you suggested.

Maria

Maria:
I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and
probably
the PSE&G Guaranty:

2.   In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up
amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads
:"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged
between
the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements,
replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")

Let me know if you have a problem with this.

Joe:
I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use 
the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that.  
Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC?

Carol,

We've had some issues lately with EnronOnline deals and Puget Sound.  Should 
this entity always be booked with ECC?  Currently, depending on the index 
traded, it downloads into Trade Capture as either ENA or ECC.  In speaking 
with Tana the other day we had decided that whichever Enron entity downloads 
is the one we should confirm the deal under.

thanks,
Joe

Joe:
We are entering into an Agreement with Puget Sound Energy, Inc. in which we 
are agreeing to some chnages to our new form of Annex A.  Enclosed is the new 
form which we have agreed to which should be attached to all trades done with 
Puget after February 2, 2000.  Alos enclosed is the Agreement that we will 
enter into.  Call me if you have any questions.

Leslie:
Dave Forster must sign off on all ETA amendments that we do.  It may be a 
good idea for you to send him the new ETA amendment letter and walk him 
through the chnages that you have made to address your issues so that he 
understands what is going on.  If you want me to be involved in that 
conversation, I'm happy to participate.  Thanks.

Cort:

I have reviewed the Mutual Assistance Agreement and am not entirely 
comfortable that it establishes the authority of GPU Services Company to 
enter into power transactions on behalf of the utilities.  The Agreement 
provides in Section 3 that "each Company . . . will furnish to such other 
Company  . . . one or more of the Goods . . ." and that "[a]ll Goods provided 
hereunder shall be priced at cost . . ."  Thus, the Agreement provides that 
the Service Company can buy power and sell it to a utility at cost.  It does 
not expressly provide that the Service Company can act as agent on behalf of 
the utilities in purchasing or selling power on their behalf.

I wanted to confirm that there was no other documentation available that more 
clearly identified the authority of GPU Services to act as agent on behalf of 
the utilities.  In the absence of such documentation, I propose language to 
add to the Electronic Trading Agreement to address my concerns.  I would also 
like to have each of the utilities sign a short acknowledgment form 
acknowledging the authority of GPU Service Company to enter into transactions 
with EPMI on its behalf.   Attached below please find my proposed revisions 
to the Letter Agreement amending the ETA (which was originally forwarded to 
you by Carol St. Clair) as well as the proposed Acknowledgment.

I look forward to discussing any questions or comments you may have.

Leslie: The Mutual Assistance Agreement that was sent to you was filed with 
the
Pa PUC . I'll check but I believe the filing to which you are referring was
originally filed with the SEC back in the early 1970's and has since been
amended a number of times.  Obviously as a part of a holding company structure
GPU Service is required to have SEC approval to provide services to our
operating companies. The GPU Service corporate records are not located here in
Reading, PA....do you really need the SEC document? Cort

 cc:

 Subject: Enron Online

As I understand it, Section 13(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
requires registered holding companies to obtain approval from the SEC in order
to form a service company to provide services to its affiliates in the system.
I have reviewed the Mutual Assistance Agreement that John faxed to me earlier.
Is this the Agreement which was filed by General Public Utilities Corporation
with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(b) of the PUHCA on SEC Form U-13-1 or
otherwise?

Dear Carol -

Enclosed are drafts of (i) the ISDA schedule, (ii) Paragraph 13 to the
Credit Support Annex, and (iii) our standard guarantee.   Also included is a
draft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.

Please note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current
issues would more easily be seen in the draft.

Comments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:  Note - our legal
council is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now,
and we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal department
review next week.

1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant
Reves, they decided to make the cross default threshold at $100MM for each
credit support provider.
2.  1(h):  Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will
apply for 3 years or less; Loss for over 3 years.
3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word
"obligations" in para B, 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning
affiliates.  I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on
my 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do
you think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is
out most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can
execute.
4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it
to just trading staff and (b) adding "to the extent permitted by applicable
law".
5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement.
However, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the
adding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is.
6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I
have no objections to your changes
7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even
though we don't normally use Independent Amounts.
8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your
request.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position
of the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured
party attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is
within 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the
L/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since
Enron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does
your position improve based on this change?
8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM
and Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).

For questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.

Thanks!

John

I am not sure whether I sent a copy of the insurance policy to you earlier, 
so I am attaching a copy to the note.  This policy is mostly complete and 
reflects all the exclusions that AC would include after our discussion with

Hi Carol. I'm really thrilled for you. How long do you plan to stay out?

 Scott and Andrea are having a baby! So I'll be a grandmother in

Mark:
I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to 
the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk 
Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and 
warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and 
in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL 
was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on 
EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."   We went 
back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was 
transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure 
that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is 
to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it 
and use it with respect to the products that they offer.

All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to 
our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent 
is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that 
according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.  
We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead 
us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to 
transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering 
these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Richard:
In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with 
respect to the arbitration and process agent language:

1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have 
enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial 
even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be 
enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be 
enforced in court?

2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process 
agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or 
maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct 
assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.

I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will 
arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration 
issues and questions.

Carol

Greg:
Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA 
forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters?

1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we 
should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?

2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant 
reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we 
have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is 
when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is 
this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when 
ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you.

providing you with the number of an alternative contact in our Contracts
Department:

Angela Weber, Contracts Department
phone:  (816) 527-1293
email:  aweber@utilicorp.com

To recap, the concern is that Board Resolutions are not in the ISDA as
"Documents to be Delivered".  I would propose that both parties provide them
anyway, regardless of whether they are listed in the ISDA, in order to avoid
having to redraft and re-sign the agreement please discuss this with Angela
in my absence.  Please have yourself or Susan give Angela a call to discuss.
Again, my apologies for the "11th hour'' nature of these concerns.

Please find attached clean and black-lined versions of the Swap Confirmation, 
Swap Assignment Agreement and Calculation Agency Agreement.

Please note that in the Swap Confirmation, items relating to the Sarlux 
Indexation Adjustment, forms of Calculation Agent Certificate and Independent 
Engineers Certificate and Schedule 4 (Projected Adjustments) still require 
completion.? We would therefore welcome the suggestions of the working group 
in order to finalise these outstanding items.? We currently plan to circulate 
revised drafts of the Swap documents on Monday to the Equity,? which will 
incorporate comments we receive from the group by Monday am (London time).

You will note that the $ amount for the Trakya Forced Outage Adjustment has 
been changed to $911,000 (from $910,000).? This reflects the most up to date 
figures sent to us from Jeff Ball at DLJ.

Kind regards

John and Molly:
I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here is 
a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already 
notified them that they needed to post collateral: 

1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2 
Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us.  

2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination 
Date.  The "Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we 
need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation 
(and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they 
have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early 
Termination Date once the Event of Default had occurred and then subsequently 
provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.

As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I need copies of all of the letters 
that we have sent to them along with copies of the confirmations of all 
outstanding trades.

All notices will need to be sent by federal express delivery such that they 
won't be effective until the day after they have been sent out.

How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got
about
another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over
with.  I
hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me.  Are you
free
for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up.  E-mail me
back
with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell Patti I said
hi.

I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference

25th and Friday, June 16th.  Sara and I are going to try and set something up 
with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.  Can we 
plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global 
contracts group for the other 2 dates?  Sara and I need to talk about what to 
do with the credit group.

I spoke with Utilicorp's contract person today and we have decided to do the 
following:

1. Leave the ISDA dated May 3, 2000
2. Change the Assignment Effective Date in the Transfer Agreement to whatever 
date we agree upon with Utilicorp.

Apparently, the ISDA has not been signed yet but will be by them in the next 
few days.  Until Russell comes back, they cannot sign the Transfer 
Agreement.  Could you please do the following this week:

1. Have the enclosed new form of Transfer Agreement signed and sent to 
Russell.  Leave the date on Page 1 blank.
2. Send to Russell the additional certificate that he is requesting attaching 
ENA's resolutions.
Thanks.

Brant:
How much lead time to we need to make the switch online?  Does Utilicorp have 
a password?  I'm hopeful that by sometime next week, they will sign the 
Transfer Agreement so that all trades could be confirmed under Utilicorp.

I need your help in answering the following questions:

EL PASO

Is the collateral threshold for both of us $50,000,000?
What are the Guaranty caps?
Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000?
Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it 
apply to the parties and their credit support providers?

OCCIDENTAL

Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?

Carol

 Susan:
Please add the following to your memo:

I(B)
Footnotes #4 and 5 - revisit why FDI Act language is added.
Consult with Richard Sanders regarding Process Agent, arbitration and Waiver 
of Jury Trial issues
Footnote #22 - Sara to draft language providing for a mutual Termination Event
Consult with Shari Stack regarding the need for the additional reps in 
footnote #55
Sara to confirm that language for footnote #73 can be used as part of our 
form for all counterparties

II(A)

Confirm that "ratings test" language in definitions of Letter of Credit and 
Letter of Credit Default works and is what credit wants
Decide how "foreign bank" language in definition of Letter of Credit should 
work
Confirm that our new Custodian language works for credit

II(B)

Can footnote #2 be deleted?

Thanks.

I have finally heard back from my credit person on all of the credit points 
that I wanted him to confirm.  The only change that he raised was on the 
cross default where he said that the threshold was $100,000,000 for the 
Credit Support Providers and $10,000,000 for each party.    I will send you a 
new mark up on that.  Otherwise, everything else credit wise was as stated in

Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can 
respond to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1. With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our 
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I 
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5 
(b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from 
the ESP rep below it.

3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different 
from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has 
fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with 
respect to it (the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any 
payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the 
exercise of setoff rights.

4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal 
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.

5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.

6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii).  
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Rhett:
You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of 
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax".  
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I 
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed 
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a 
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, 
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such 
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or 
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to 
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's 
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis 
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It 
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?

Mark, Jason and Sara:

Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various "Securities Act" reps in the 
ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require 
us and them to say:

1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of 
securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold 
except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption.

2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor.

3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party 
is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute 
restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer.

What do you think about this?

Our legal department is in the process of reviewing the schedule, paragraph
13, and L/C provisions/schedule.  I will send you new drafts once I
incorporate comments from them. Two other things:
1.  Enclosed is a "new" format of Guarantee for your review.  Actually, this
should be similar to the 1995/6 version Enron has already accepted.
2.  I disagree with your changes in C/D threshold discussed below.   We
prefer to limit this to the Credit Support Provider (as per your original
change) as this is who guarantees the ISDA.  I have incorporated your
original comments with little change which you can review when I send the
drafts.

Guaranty that I provideed.  Enclosed is the new form.  Let me know what you

closing documents to pay off and unwind Project Alchemy and place the asset 
into the Project Hawaii structure.  This transaction is structured as a trust 
to trust transfer, which is contemplated in the Amended and Restated Hawaii 
125-O Facility Agreement.  The anticipated closing date for this transaction 
is May 31, 2000.  The only significant missing information in the documents 
is the maturity date and the related auction dates.  Please advise as to the 
maturity date and I will calculate the auction dates.

The documents attached are clean versions in Word.  Immediately following 
this e-mail, I will send a follow-up e-mail with clean versions of each 
document in Word Perfect.  Following that, I will send two e-mails attaching 
copies of the documents marked against the Project Blackbird Unwind and 
related Hawaii 125-O Danno A documents, in both Word and Word Perfect.

Would it be possible to assign names instead of numbers to the documents that

Please e-mail.  Thanks - Maria

Brant:
We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:

1. Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to 
Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP);
2. Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy 
and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.

Here is what I need to know from you:

1. Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these 
trades?  If so, please fax me a copy.

2. Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing 
Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master?

Please advise.

Suzanne:
Could you please coordinate with Sara's and Richard's assistant to set up a 
30 minute meeting with me, Sara and Richard Sanders to talk about the 
arbitration issues that I raised in an e-mail to him last week?  thanks.
Carol

Susan and Susan:
In an effort to better manage your work flows, Sara and I would like to meet 
with you for about 30 minutes this week to get an idea of what's on your 
plate and what we can do to ease the work load.  Could you please give this 
some thought and let Taffy know when you want to meet so she can get it set 
up?  Thanks.
Carol

Susan:
Please order the existence and good standing certificates from Texas and 
Delaware that we will need as back-up for Mark's opinion.  I anticipate 
having him sign it this week so please see if you can get faxed copies of 
these before Friday.  Thanks.
Carol

Susan:
Could you have Taffy type up a new issues list based on your initial e-mail 
and the e-mail that I sent to you for tomorrow's group meeting so that I can 
pass it around?  Thanks.

Carol

Russell:
I will draft something up later today for you  to look at.  With respect to 
Richardson Products, the July 29, 1999 Guaranty in the second paragraph 
already picks up all ECT affiliates which would include HPL, such that any 
physical contract between ECT or its affiliates and Richardson Products II, 
Ltd. would already be covered.  Their letter mentions an April 28th 
Guaranty.  Does one exist?

Why I don't think that we need to say anything with respect to the July 29th 
Guaranty, it certainly wouldn't hurt for them to simply send us a letter 
referencing this Guaranty and stating that it is their understanding that the 
term "ECT Affiliates" as used in the Guaranty  includes Houston Pipe Line 
Company.

Hello Parents!

Camp is about to begin!  Are you ready?  Well, we are, and we're excited 
about it!!!  Here are some details that will hopefully answer any questions 
you might have about your child's experience in Enron's Kidventure summer 
camp.

Camp officially begins each morning between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m.   You must 
bring your child to the Energizer private dining room by 8 a.m. (at the 
latest) each morning.  You do not need visitor badges for your children.  
Enron security is fully aware that you will be bringing your children in each 
morning.  We will have five dedicated Enron security guards helping us with 
the camp each day to ensure your child's safety while in the building.    
When going from the Energizer to the bus, your children will ride a dedicated 
elevator escorted by an Enron security guard.  Kidventure camp counselors 
will be active with your children as soon as you drop them off in the morning 
until the bus leaves at 8:15 a.m.   Your children will return to Enron at 4 
p.m. each afternoon, and will continue their Enron-site activities until you 
pick them up between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.  All children MUST be picked up by 5 
p.m.   A fee of $1 per minute after 5 p.m will be charged.

At the beginning of each week of camp, you will pay the remainder of your 
balance to Kidventure Camps.  Your children will also receive their official 
camp t-shirt on the first day of camp.  You may purchase additional t-shirts 
for $10.00 each.  Each child will also make a name tag on their first day 
which they will use for their camp term.  

Also, if you have not sent in your liability release forms, I must have them 
by tomorrow. Thanks!

Hopefully I have answered all of your questions, if not, please call me at 
x37514 or e-mail me.
Thank you and have a great summer! 

Michelle

Tanya:
Here is a summary of what has been agreed to with El Paso:

Cross Default Threshold - $100,000,000 for each of us.  They want this just 
to apply at the Credit Support provider level
Guaranty Cap - $55,000,000 for each of us
Collateral Threshold - $50,000,000; Rounding at $250,000.  No minimum 
transfer amount
Setoff may possibly still be open re affiliates but I think that they will 
come around on this

Carol

Steve:
Our tax counsel has recommended that we not agree to the amendment to the 
definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" that you have proposed in your draft.  Do 
you have a tax person that he can talk to and get this issue resolved?
Carol

Sara:
I have not been dealing with the confirm desk on this.  The only area that I 
have been working with them on is "unexecuted confirms".

Carol:  Haven't you been speaking with the confirm desk about identifying 
high volume transactions with "masterless" counterparties?  I don't want to 
duplicate work efforts.  Maybe you and I can chat during the time originally 
set aside for Richard (this morning).  Thanks.  Sara

Definitely want to upgrade #1 - its on my list of ISDA upgrades as follows:

Done:  TXU, JAron
In Progress:  El Paso, Occidental, Reliant
To Do:  Morgan Stanley, Dynegy, Statoil, Vitol, Valero, Sempra

Can your dept provide a breakdown of type of executed masters? There are (as 
of today) 423 masters - can we break out which ones are old ECT masters?  
That may give us some insight in to any others that need upgrades.  Also, the 
confirm desk should be able to tell us the level of activity (as they did 
before) to determine priority.  Eventually, we would like to get to all of 
these; however, establishing new documents where we have none (Cargill, 
Mieco, Idacorp, PanCanadian) is my first priority.

Rod should be able to address #3.

Thanks,
Tanya

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Peter:
Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change 
the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the 
following:

"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities 
Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."  Our current rep is 
attached.  Is this something that we can agree to?
Carol

Rhett:
Thanks for your response.  I have asked Deutsche Bank for the name of their 
tax counsel in case they don't agree with our position.  I'll keep you posted.
Carol

	Rhett Jackson
	05/23/2000 06:58 PM
		
Carol:

I'd rather not change our standard agreement.  Specifically, the current 
definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" covers both present and future tax (as 
evidenced in the definition "Tax") and thus, necessarily, should protect the 
counterparty in the case of a "Change in Tax Law."  Moreover, Deutsche Bank's 
amendment to "Indemnifiable Tax" potentially subjects us to risk that I don't 
feel is in our best interest to assume because we don't have any control over 
the counterparty's activities.  Bottom line - I would reject the amendment.

Please let me know if you would like me to speak to their tax counsel.

Rhett:
You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of 
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax".  
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I 
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed 
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a 
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, 
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such 
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or 
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to 
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's 
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis 
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It 
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?

Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Our legal department is in the process of reviewing the schedule, paragraph
13, and L/C provisions/schedule.  I will send you new drafts once I
incorporate comments from them. Two other things:
1.  Enclosed is a "new" format of Guarantee for your review.  Actually, this
should be similar to the 1995/6 version Enron has already accepted.
2.  I disagree with your changes in C/D threshold discussed below.   We
prefer to limit this to the Credit Support Provider (as per your original
change) as this is who guarantees the ISDA.  I have incorporated your
original comments with little change which you can review when I send the
drafts.

Here is a very rough draft of a proposed letter agreement for NGTS.  It 
requires some work but hopefully it's a start.  It cannot be finalized until 
we see all of the physical and financial confirms and agreements and should 
NOT be sent to NGTS until Sara and I are comfortable that it works.

I have given the opinion to Susan to get signed.  We are waiting to receive

Carol,

I spoke to our in house counsel about the arbitration clause and they are
willing to leave it in.
So, to sum up here are our responses your original eMail:

1.  Canadian Securities Rep:  Please have your Canadian counsel review our
language which our outside Canadian counsel prepared.
2.  Ok.
3.  We're ok with this now.
4.  We're ok to leave this in.
5.  Ok.
6.  Please see my comments below.

Thanks,

Sandy Morrison

Carol,

My tax department is ok with the forms in Part 3 a i) and ii) of ths
schedule, but ask that 3 a)ii) be changed to "...before December 31st of
each third succeeding year..." (ie, the same as part 3a)i)).

Also they have asked that we obtain the proper mailing address and contact
name for these forms.

Plese let me know if there is a problem with this requested change.

Thank you,

Sandy Morrison

Carol,

Sheri's number in Washington is 253-924-3184.

Thank you,

Sandy:
I have not yet contacted our tax group about this.  I think that the
easiest thing to do is for you to give me Sheri's phone number and I will
ask someone from our tax group to contact her.  It probably will be Rhett

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
(b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
(ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Carol,

Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can=
=20
agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ("WCL") in order to=20
replace the existing securities representations (as found near the bottom o=
f=20
this e-mail) in the ISDA to:

"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities=20
Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."

From my perspective, there are four main reasons why this amendment would n=
ot=20
be appropriate.  They are as follows:

1.  Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives ("91-504") and the=
=20
corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.  At this=20
time, 91-504 is merely a proposal.  In addition to checking the Ontario=20
Securities Commission ("OSC") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=
t=20
brought the "securities representation" issue to our attention and he has=
=20
confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20
announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such=
=20
adoption.

2.  Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade=
=20
with Enron Canada Corp. ("Enron Canada") is likely to be considered a "trad=
e=20
within Alberta" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head=
=20
office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).  As a=
=20
result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta=
=20
securities law.

3.  In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a "trade" can take place in =
a=20
number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. =
=20
Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be=
=20
made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.  With the exception o=
f=20
British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20
similar "blanket orders", "policies" or "rules" with respect to this issue.=
 =20
However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=
he=20
forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20
jurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=
04=20
is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. =
=20
Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=
a=20
in place at this time.

4.  I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=
e=20
fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an "OTC Derivative"=
=20
(and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20
potentially available to them).  I can think of no reason why it would be=
=20
beneficial to either party to remove this representation.

With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and =
3=20
above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20
provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act=
=20
(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=
nd=20
are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following=
=20
clause:

"(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an =
=01&OTC=20
derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=
ties=20
legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20
securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the=
=20
Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of=
=20
paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20
paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order=
=20
BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=
om=20
time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made=
=20
pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other=
=20
jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;"

I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to=
=20
the "open-ended" nature of the above-mentioned clause.  If we want to refer=
=20
to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I=
=20
would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:

Canadian Securities Acts.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC=
=20
Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=
s Act=20
(British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i=
s=20

curities=20
Commission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20
Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the dat=
e=20
hereof.

to:

Canadian Securities Legislation.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an=
=20
"OTC derivative" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities=20
Commission Order Doc#394043 ("ASC 394043"), paragraph 1.1 of British Columb=
ia=20

paragraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commission Rule 91-504 =01)=
=20
Over-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities=20
Commission on January 7, 2000] ("[Proposed] OSC 91-504"), as applicable to=

paragraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in effe=
ct=20
on the date hereof, and (iii) it is a "qualified party" within the meaning =
of=20
paragraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.

Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed=
=20
language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which=
=20
were drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t=
he=20
Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alber=
ta=20
or British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with=
=20

ou=20
may want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).

I hope this discussion is useful for you.  If you have any questions, pleas=

do not hesitate to give me a call.  I can be reached directly at (403)=20

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is redlined version of ISDA Schedule and CSA, marked against the
July 7, 1999 version (please note that open items I left as is unless
otherwise indicated).

Also note that the Indemnifiable Tax clause is a head office policy
issue--DB's position is that, in cross-border transactions, the Payee may
not be in a position to learn of a Tax imposed due to a Change in Tax Law
in the Payor's jurisdiction which is based upon the Payee's connection with
the Payor's jurisdiction, no matter how tenuous that connection.  In such a
situation, the Tax would not be an IndemnifiableTax and therefore would not
be grossed-up.  Further, although such a change would be a Tax Event and
therefore the Payee could terminate the Agreement upon learning of the Tax,
the Payee, because of its inability to learn of the tax law change might
not be able to terminate in a  timely manner and would be precluded from
choosing not to enter into the Transaction. The worse-case scenario would
be a Transaction entered into shortly prior to the Change in Tax Law, in
which case the Tax would not be grossed-up because it is not an
Indemnifiable Tax, and the Payee could not terminate the Transaction
because a Tax Event is triggered off of a Change in Tax Law occurring on or
after the Transaction has been entered into.  We think this risk is
reciprocal in cross-border transactions. The Indemnifiable Tax revision
simply shifts this incremental risk from the Payee to Payor.  I can also
provide alternative language whereby we maintain the same gross-up
provisions as in the standard ISDA Master, but extend the "notice" period
to sixty days prior to the date a Transaction is entered into (rather than
on the date in which a Transaction is entered into), thus providing a
window for learning of legislation in other jurisdictions.

On other open issues, I believe you are to check on (i) CEUM, (ii) the
Event of Default, (iii)  Payment Netting, (iv) Securities Act Reps (v)
Transfer language, and (vi) Arbitration. I need to review your comments on
(i) the Guarantee and (ii) your new L/C Agreement.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Steve

Does this response incliude Alicia's comments that she sent to you, some of 
which had not been raised yet by me or others?
Carol  

Mark and Jeff:
Trina and i talked about the issue that you raised with me today.  Our 
preference is to structure the language so that it would only trigger an 
Event of Default under the Swap if the Enron merger caused an Event of 
Default under the Revolver.  At the end of the day, we both felt that this is 
a call that someone on the commercial side should make, such as either Ben 
Glisan or Mike Jakubik.

Rod:
Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
"materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to 
"netting".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

Susan:
It's not clear to me what needs to be done on the file.  Has Paul contacted 
them about his note on 4/7?  If not, call Paul and find out if he wants you 
to make that call as that seems like the logical next step to take.  As far 
as their other comments, we cannot delete the Recording language on page 6

would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement 
and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what that 
date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the 
trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.  Thanks.

2.  Ok.
3.  We're ok with this now.
4.  We're ok to leave this in.
5.  Ok.
6.  Please see my comments below.

Carol,

My tax department is ok with the forms in Part 3 a i) and ii) of ths
schedule, but ask that 3 a)ii) be changed to "...before December 31st of
each third succeeding year..." (ie, the same as part 3a)i)).

Also they have asked that we obtain the proper mailing address and contact
name for these forms.

Plese let me know if there is a problem with this requested change.

Thank you,

Sandy Morrison

Carol,

Sheri's number in Washington is 253-924-3184.

Thank you,

Sandy

Sandy:
I have not yet contacted our tax group about this.  I think that the
easiest thing to do is for you to give me Sheri's phone number and I will
ask someone from our tax group to contact her.  It probably will be Rhett
Jackson.

Carol,

Further to our conversatiaon yesterday, I would like to get Sheri Dunn,
from
the Weyerhaesuer tax group and a tax representative from Enron on the phone
sometime (hopefully today).  Sheri is available at 10:30 Pacific time
(=1:30
est,  12:30 Central)  today.  Do you think we can work with that?

Thanks,

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
(b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
(ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

 We're still trying for the Enron preferred route of not submitting
to jurisdiction, but somehow the new language slipped in anyway.  If it does
have to stay, I'll double check to make sure it is the language that Enron
accepts when forced to submit to jurisdiction in NY.  I believe it is.

I am assuming that someone on the Enron Corp. side has signed off on the new
"jurisdiction" language that has now been inserted into the swap assignment

there
before.  Please confirm.

I spoke with the contact that you left me last week and she indicated that 
the ISDA had not yet been signed but that in all likelihood it would be 
signed in a few days.  I asked Susan bailey to send you the certificate with 
resolutions that you requested along with a new draft of the Transfer 
Agreement which has a blank for the date.  My thought was that everything 
would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement 
and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what that 
date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the 
trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.  Thanks.

GPU Service Inc. as agent for NJ.  Pending resolution of Enpower bridging

We already have a Master Agreement with Swiss Re in place so I don't 
understand why we would enter into another one with them to do online

sent up for my review a form of ELRIX GA Participation Agreement which I had 
sent them comments and questions on.  Is that related to this?  It would be 
helpful to me if perhaps you, mark and i could meet so you could explain to

Steven :
I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with Rod 
Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:

1. We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default 
provision.  We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and 
second-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that.  

2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for 
"materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?

3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to 
Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).  
Is that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do 
more with netting across product lines.

4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to 
resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.  

I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules and 
will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.

Sue:
Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's 
baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do, 
things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that 
I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.

Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got 
the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so 
I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am 
still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a 
few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm 
trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here 
at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will 
help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.  
Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few 
weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time 
off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being 
uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is 
good practice for when the baby comes.

Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger 
pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is 
still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which 
we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every 
day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping 
that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on 
cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a 
week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the 
possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see 
how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby 
is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any 
time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in 
august.  Let me know what you think.

How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you 
want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something 
on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.

What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying 
what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am 
going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the 
rest of the year off.

I've got to run to my "baby class" tonight.  Take care and I will try to 
catch up with you sometime.  I love you!

Scott and Bruce:
I understand from talking to Jane this morning that we will be able to work 
with you as our counsel on the above transaction that we are working with ACE 
on.  My understanding from our commercial people is that we should be getting 
a redraft of the insurance policy sometime today with ACE which we will need 
your help in reviewing.  Leslie Hansen and I will be working on this from the 
legal end, with Leslie's focus being on the "power" issues and mine on the 
"derivative" issues.  As I mentioned to Scott last week, we will alos need 
your help in making sure that the derivative taht we draft is not construed 
to be insurance.  A draft of the confirmation taht we anticipate using will 
be sent out later this week.

In terms of timing, our goal is to be on-line by June 15th which will require 
us to try to get all documentation finalized as soon as possible.  I will 
keep you posted on any updates to our schedule.  Please feel free to call me

Tanya:
We still don't have it and we were hoping that someone on the commercial side 
would place a call to J Aron.  We agreed to it weeks ago and there is no 
reason why we shouldn't have it by now.  Since the existing Guaranty does not 
cover the new Master I do not consider the new Master to be effective.   
Apparently there is some confusion on J Aron's part since they keep referring 
to the new Master in their confirms.  I have left a message for their 
counsel, Luanne Giessen, that we do not consider the new Master effective 
until we receive the new Guaranty.  Tana has left numerous messages with her 
alos about getting the Guaranty.

Rod:

There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:

1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across 
product lines.  Are you okay with this?

2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have 
no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations 
required under each transaction that we enter into with them.    
Specifically, the CA does the following:

- calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash 
Settlement Amount payable
- gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates
- determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred

Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to 
$25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially 
requested no cap.

On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following 
credit issues:

1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You 
were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to 
amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think 
you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified 
Transaction.

2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?

3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define "materially weaker" as 
either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being 
failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.

4. On setoff, they did not have the "affiliate" language.

5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both 
financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and 
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.

6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and 
Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.

AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000
A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000
BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000 
BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000

 Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by 
Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.

7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the 
types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the 
events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:

- If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written 
demand by the Secured Party
- if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms 
or rejects the LC - 1 Business day after the pledgor receives notice of 
dishonor
- if LC fails to be in full force and effect or issuer declares bankruptcy - 
3 Business Days after written demand by Secured Party

In our form, we require substitute collateral to be posted within 2 Business 
Days of the occurrence of the above events, except for a downgrade where the 
time period is 5 Business Days

On SG Interests, you were going to talk to them about certain credit issues.

Please let me know when you can where you stand on the above.  Thanks.

Did you mean to refer to dates in June?  Alos, could you let me know which 
persons or persons will be handling the areas that we need covered as so far 
I am only aware of you and Scott and i wasn't sure if others would be

I will be away from the office on business from the evening of Friday, May 
12th, returning on Monday, May 22nd.  During this period, I will not have 
email access for a portion of the trip and there may, therefore, be a delay 
in my responding to emails sent during this period.

John:
My fault.  It should say "succeeding Scheduled Payment Date" and Scheduled 
Payment Date is defined in Section 14 of the ISDA form.  As far as choice of 
law, we can go with NY although I disagree with your counsel, in that in 
order for the New York choice of law to be enforced by a court, the parties 
have to demonstrate some minimum relationship with the jurisdiction chose.

Carol - two issues:  First, dealing with the applicable law, you can see
from the copies message below, from our legal counsel, that we will not
accept Texas law.  Second, I looked through my ISDA booklets and cannot find
that term "Succeeding Payment Date" defined anywhere.  Can you specify where
it is defined?

John
Arbitration may be held in Houston, Texas, using New York law.

 Regarding Part 4(h) on the use of Texas vs. NY law - Enron feels
that since both Parties are Texas entities, we should use Texas law.  Carol
St. Clair (Enron attorney) feels that Texas laws are adequate in dealing
with ISDA disputes, our lawyers know Texas law, and that we both would have
to have a connection or contact in NY to use NY law.

 What is your opinion?

I would expect that I (I use Bruce), Scot, John McGreevy and Sam Behrens 
would likely be involved.  Sam is an energy lawyer familiar with nuclear 
facilities and would be helpful with background issues.

Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather 
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could 
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used 
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would 
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.

Carol

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already 
set forth in the Master?

Shari:
The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the 
confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to 
include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is 
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of our 
confirms. One thing though - did the revised  Fallback Reference Weather 
Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and 
have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/ 
him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording. 

One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have 
included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in 
mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special 
wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of 
confirmation.

Mark and Jarrod:
Regarding this project of streamlining weather confirms, Shari asked about 
the new language that we were gong to use to define the procedures for 
determining the Fallback reference Weather Station.  Has that language ever 
been finalized?  This is one of the things that I thought we could pull out 
of the confirms so before we send out any Master Agreement amendments, we 
should try to get this language finalized.

Hi Carol:

Thanks for the comments.

1.  The materiality language in the cross-default is DB policy, which we
cannot change.

2.   For CEUM, I will need to get treasury and credit approval.

3.   We should be able to work something out for same product netting.

4.  Should be ok.

Regarding the guarantee, we need to discuss the demand section.  With
respect to the defences, let me propose a compromise--namely that the
Guarantor can raise whatever defences it could have raised had we dealt
directly with the Guarantor as Counterparty.  Anything more than that,
would be a subjecting DB to additional  risk.

Regards,

Steve

Original Message from Carol.St.Clair@enron.com @ HUB on 05/30:

Steven :
I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with
Rod
Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:

1.   We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default
provision.
We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and second-guessing
and
the language that you proposed does just that.

2.   On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard
for
"materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?

3.   With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to
Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).
Is
that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do
more
with netting across product lines.

4.   In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days
to
resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of
1.

I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules
and
will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.

Carol

Steve:
I have forwarded this to Rod Nelson in our credit group.   On the Guaranty 
defenses issue, one of our  biggest concerns is getting the benefit of ENA's 
setoff rights.  I'm not sure that your solution protects us but let me give 
it some more thought and discuss this with Enron's general counsel.  Let's 
wait to talk until I am able to address all of the issues that I am 
responsible for.

Hi Carol:

Thanks for the comments.

1.  The materiality language in the cross-default is DB policy, which we
cannot change.

2.   For CEUM, I will need to get treasury and credit approval.

3.   We should be able to work something out for same product netting.

4.  Should be ok.

Regarding the guarantee, we need to discuss the demand section.  With
respect to the defences, let me propose a compromise--namely that the
Guarantor can raise whatever defences it could have raised had we dealt
directly with the Guarantor as Counterparty.  Anything more than that,
would be a subjecting DB to additional  risk.

Regards,

Steve

Original Message from Carol.St.Clair@enron.com @ HUB on 05/30:

Steven :
I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with
Rod
Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:

1.   We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default
provision.
We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and second-guessing
and
the language that you proposed does just that.

2.   On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard
for
"materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?

3.   With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to
Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).
Is
that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do
more
with netting across product lines.

4.   In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days
to
resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of
1.

I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules
and
will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.

Carol

Suzanne:
Could you please set up a 30 minute meeting Monday morning with Rod to 
discuss Reliant Energy Services ISDA issues?
Thanks.
Carol

Ann:
I haven't forgotten about you and I will attempt to try and call you 
tomorrow.

Rhett:
I am going to send to you some revised tax reps that Dresdner Bank would like 
to use in lieu of what we currently have drafted.  Could you please review 
them and let me know if they are acceptable?  Thanks.

Rod:

There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:

1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across 
product lines.  Are you okay with this?

2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have 
no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations 
required under each transaction that we enter into with them.    
Specifically, the CA does the following:

- calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash 
Settlement Amount payable
- gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates
- determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred

Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to 
$25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially 
requested no cap.

On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following 
credit issues:

1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You 
were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to 
amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think 
you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified 
Transaction.

2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?

3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define "materially weaker" as 
either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being 
failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.

4. On setoff, they did not have the "affiliate" language.

5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both 
financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and 
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.

6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and 
Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.

AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000
A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000
BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000 
BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000

 Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by 
Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.

7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the 
types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the 
events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:

- If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written 
demand by the Secured Party
- if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms 
or rejects the LC - 1 Business day after the pledgor receives notice of 
dishonor
- if LC fails to be in full force and effect or issuer declares bankruptcy - 
3 Business Days after written demand by Secured Party

In our form, we require substitute collateral to be posted within 2 Business 
Days of the occurrence of the above events, except for a downgrade where the 
time period is 5 Business Days

On SG Interests, you were going to talk to them about certain credit issues.

Please let me know when you can where you stand on the above.  Thanks.

The Master only covers financial so I assumed that we were just dealing with 
financial trades.  Should we be covering physical?  If so, it may be best to 
handle that in a separate letter.

The below Draft Omnibus is what would go out on an EOL deal.  I've attached 
both EOL GTC's (one with Credit required, and one without)

Thanks,
Joe

 

At Lisa Mellencamp's request I am sending you the amendment agreements that 
we have drafted with respect to the physical and financial masters between 
KCS and Enron.  Drafts of these agreements were sent to Harry Stout earlier 
this week and some changes have been made since then.  I am enclosing both 
clean and marked copies.  If you have any questions, please call me or Lisa.  
My number is 853-3989.
Carol

Enclosed is a revised draft of the policy without any modifications on the 
exclusions as this is an area that ACE is apparently continuing to develop.  
As I mentioned yesterday, we will talk with you about this on Monday at 
1(Houston time).  Our commercial team would then like to have a call with ACE 
sometime after our call to talk about exclusions, subrogation rights and 
matters relating to books and records that are addressed in the policy.  I 
don't think that all of you need to be on this call but was wondering if any 
of you would be available for this call.  Please let me know.

here is a redlined version from the previous draft.  i'm giving you this to
highlight what changed, but you may want to just "Accept all changes" to
have a fresh copy to look at.  this still has some things to work on, so let
your counsel know that.  let me know when we can meet monday or tuesday.

ACE would like to review the previously forwarded draft policy  on Monday 
(6/5). The three areas ACE would like to discuss are subrogation, books & 
records and exclusions. We ceratainly are free to add to the list based upon 
our review of the policy. Please indicate your availability on Monday in the 
pm for 1-1 1/2 hrs. Thanks.

Anne:
I discussed this with Mark Taylor and after we receive the next draft we will 
come up with some language that basically will except out of the disclaimer 
sections the information that you receive from us when your offer is accepted 
that appears in the transaction summary section on your server.

This morning Carol and I discussed the ETA, and I indicated our concern that
sections 2(g) and 4 be amended so TLM can rely on the information on the
Website which we use for our offer. She is going to address this with Mark
Taylor and call us back. I believe it is a matter of finding words to
satisfy both of us.

Please note that our requests in section 2 (b) and (d) will not be included,
as section 3(c) governs.

Enron also advises in section 6(b) the assignment and consent will only
apply to assignments made by TLM not Enron, and our remedy would be to stop
using the website until we were satisfied with their assignee.

Carol and I also discussed the possibility of having a letter agreement with
the Amended ETA attached,(rather than an 'exceptions' letter), which would
be the governing doc once we 'click'.

I believe we are very close to concluding this.

Best regards

I spoke with David Forster about the procedures for the auction and the 
possibility to include a different GTC.  According to him this should not be 
an issue and that we don't need to get Mark Taylor's approval, as this has 
already been cleared by him for other transactions.  I am going to meet with 
the EOL people again and I will forward you and the team any changes in the 
procedures if they arise.

Carol,

I have spoken to ACE and reserved 3:30 CDT for a teleconference. Thanks for 
the help.

Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:

1. In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated 
Subsidiary can be deleted.

2. In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added 
at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words "Swap Agreement" "(as it 
relates to the Assigned Interest)"?  In other words, if these events as to 
Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination 
event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap 
Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?

3. I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross 
default language that Enron is now using.

4. In Section 3.8, the word comments should be "consents".

Nora:
Per my voice mail message to you, I'm assuming that you are okay with Section 
5.6.

There are several credit issues here that we need to discuss like:

1. Their comment on the affiliate language in the setoff provision - I don't 
think that they understand how this works.

2. Their first and second comments to the CSA.

3. Their comment in the CSA about requiring a different standard for holding 
collateral.

4. Their desire to change from Fed Funds Rate to LIBOR  

5. Their renewal notice comment concerning the LC.

Please call me to discuss.  Also, Susan Bailey and I need to talk with you 
about Global Companies LLC.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.

The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need to 
have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go 
to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality 
section.  This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have 
arbitration and a ca provision.  Alos, there may be some defined terms that 
are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined 
(i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case 
"affiliates" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or 
some other def?

short-dated crude oil prepays (i.e. 180 day financially settled prepays) in

I spoke with Rod Nelson, our credit person, about the cross default language 
and we have the following proposal to make.  We are okay with the language as 
it applies to declaring a an Event of Default and then declaring an early 
Termination Date.  For purposes of triggering a reduction of the collateral 
threshold to zero, we would propose that this language would not apply such 
that an event of Default would be triggered upon the occurrence of the cross 
default.  Let me know what you think.

My only comment is to make sure that the defined terms ISDA Definitions and 
Equity Derivative Definitions pick up amendments and supplements.

Susan and Susan:
Just wanted to give you the heads up that we will need a deemed ISDA done for 
this counterparty.  Jarrod and I are working on the details but could one of 
you undertake to get this drafted by early afternoon tomorrow?  Thanks.

Mikey, 

Our official and joint press release goes out on Monday. Sarah Heward from 
Corneys got drunk on Tuesday night and blurted out the deal to her media pals 
- hence the article in the Times.

An overview of the deal (subject to them seeing the contract)

Transaction Type:       Critical Day Index Put Option. The index will
settle on the number of Thursdays and Fridays from 1/Jun/99 to 30/9/99
where the high temperature (Tmax) recorded is 24 Celcius or higher

Type:    Put
Strike:                 9 days
Price                   1.5 days (GBP 22,500)
Client buys/sells       Buys
Payment terms:          Premium upfront
Notional amount:        GBP 15,000 per critical day
Payout limit:           GBP 135,000
Trade date:             30/5/00
Reference station       Heathrow

of GBP 500

19 St Mary at Hill
London 
EC3R 8EE
tel: +44 (0)20 7929 7979

Contact person there is Stephen Doherty. He is representing Corneys in this 
deal and will probably be the person to contact to get any info that you need 
on Corneys.

Tanya and Sara:
Just an update on the ones that I am handling:

Aquila/Utilicorp will be in place tomorrow
Idacorp should be done this week as i spoke with their counsel today
Pancanadian  - we are waiting for them to decide whether they will accept the 
ISDA form of CSA
Reliant - we do have their form and Rod and I are working through credit 
issues
El Paso - I am waiting for a revised draft from them but we are close
J Aron - done

	Tanya Rohauer
	06/05/2000 03:25 PM
		
Sara,

After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it:

aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA 
and terminating Aquila Risk master
jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet
el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA

The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s:
- idacorp
- wps
-pancanadian
-duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed)
- mieco
-dynegy canada

I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have 
discussed the need to put new documentation in place with:
- morgan
- vitol

Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, 
now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for 
awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place.

The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy 
and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not 
be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be 
more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

FYI - the following list reflects old ECT master and no master counterparties 
by volume (not necessarily exposure).  Sara

Tanya:  do you want all of these names on the legal/credit list?

period Jan-May '00.

Add the first one to the ISDA status list.

For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they 
usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to 
whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing 
deals from Europe.

Thanks, Edmund

We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following 
entities:

Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and

Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.

The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the 
website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, 
South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.

Can you take a look at this for me please?

Thanks

If we need to develop a form of confirm for this, are you the person that I 
should work with or would someone else handle this?  

Rod,
Since we are doing a separate GTC for this product, we will not be able to 
"net" on any payment date what we owe the counterparty under this product 
against what the counterparty may owe us under other derivative products.  
Are you okay with this?  Alos, we have been assuming that there are no other 
counterparty credit issues with this product since other than the upfront 
premium, payments will be made from us to them.  Are we safe in assuming this?

Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we 
had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and 
here is what we concluded needed to be done:

1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial 
language

2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim 
Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language.

3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all 
circumstances it will say the following:

Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in 
________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party 
B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in 
_______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________.

Susan Bailey,
Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information 
that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC?

If you have any questions, please call me or Sara.

Jeff:
We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of 
the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.  In lieu of signing 
each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a 
letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether 
or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree 
with such terms, they will return the confirm.  Are you okay with this 
procedure?
Carol

 Susan:
Regarding Kate's e-mail, I have left a voice mail for Richard Sanders as to 
which office we should designate.  If you need to send out the ISDA draft 
before I hear back from him and before Kate hears back from Canada, go ahead 
and leave the address blank and we can fill it in later.
Carol

Mark and Sara:
Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the 
other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also 
about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training 
and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her 
that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it 
made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's 
training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am 
very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process 
given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.  
The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't 
tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's 
way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her 
that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's 
training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was 
more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.

On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to 
work better is through "communicating" to each other.  I firmly believe taht 
there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the 
other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit 
this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired 
of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my 
perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her 
increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude 
which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.

I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this 
to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.

Carol  

Bill:
I would like to go to this.  Okay with you?

Rhett:
I have asked the attorney that I am working with on this to call you directly 
about their proposed tax rep language as well as their deletion of the 
language in Part 3 regarding the delivery of tax docs.  I have enclosed below 
the language that we currently have in the Schedule which they would not 
accept and I believe you have their proposed language on the tax reps.  
Thanks again for your help.  I just think that at this point it is easier for 
the tax folks to talk directly to each other.

Mark:
Just 2 thoughts on the new draft:

1. In the definition of Global Early Termination Date, how does this work 
with the new Section 16 concept that Alicia has added to the Schedules 
whereby the termination of Transactions that raise Section 16 problems may be 
delayed?

2. Does Section 5.06 conflict at all with the proviso in the Limitation of 
Liability sections of both Schedules?

I thought that your drfat letter of intent looked fine.  Just a few 
commments.  In section 6 - Conditions, could you put something in there 
similar to the "Approvals" section in the November 10th letter since possibly 
HSR and FERC approval may be needed?  Alos, in Attachment A, in Section 3 
could you sya something to the effect that if tthere is no master in place 
with Enron and a particular counterparty then Enron needs to be satisfied 
with the terms of the master that is in place between Mrechant and such 
counterparty.

I thought that the Assignment Agreement was very weak and that we need 
something more than that.  Withg respect to the consent, the concept of the 
assigned transaction be goverened by our Master needs to be in there.   
Enclosed is the template that we have used in the Columbia deal.  

Call me if you have any questions.  The only time that I won't be reachable 
today is from 11:30-2.

On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for 
physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my 
discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up 
for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC 
approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to 
determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved 
by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open 
them up for power.  US emissions has been opened. 

P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, 
talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan 
Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract.

Brant:

I received the documents and Susan Flynn will get them executed along with 
the Enron Guaranty and the other certificates and get them back to you next

for trading purposes?  I'm assuming you want to wait for the Enron Guaranty 
and that any trades done before the Guaranty is sent to you would not be 
confirmed under the Master.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.  I 
have asked Enron's counsel to process the Guaranty ASAP.  Thanks.

John:
I have reviewed the new draft and just have a few nits which I will send 
you.  My only disagreement is with the LC language.  We feel very strongly 
that we need the LC provisions and the form of lc.  The LC provisions are 
between us and you and have nothing to do with the LC bank who will be 
issuing the LC.  They set forth the mechanics for the rights that each party 
has with respect to any LC that is issued for its benefit.  These mechanics 
need to be agreed to ahead of time.  The form of LC ties into these 
mechanics.  Our credit group will work with you when an LC is issued if for 
some reason the language in the LC does not exactly match.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.

I'm hoping that you can help me with this.  One  of the gifts that I received

Monkey design.  Thanks for your help.

I believe the gift is either from Anne or Tana.  I over heard Mary H. say she 
had to take her daughter to the doctor this morning and during the morning 
confusion did not get out the house with her baby gift for you.  Mark Taylor 
made a contribution through Sara, that I was not aware of.  He should have 
been on the list of group contributors.

Carolyn

Anne:
I'm slightly embarrassed to be asking you this, but there was one gift from 
Baby Gap that we can't seem to figure out who the "giver" was, and we've 
narrowed it down to a group that includes you.  It was 2 outfits with animal 
patterns on it.  Are you the mystery giver?

Alos, again I just wanted to say congratulations again on your engagement.  I 
am really happy for you and Trushar and wish you all the best.  I will try to 
see if we can get together for lunch before I leave.

Please plan to attend a lunch this coming Friday in 30C2 with Sara and I and 
possibly some of the newer credit people to go through basic ISDA, CSA and 
confirmation issues.  We'll get started around Noon and probably go until 
1:30.

Tanya:
This coming Friday Sara and I are going to walk the legal assistants through 
some basic concepts with respect to the ISDA and CSA Schedules and 
confirmations.  Do you think that we should invite some of the newer credit 
people to this and if so, who?  Some of this will be a repeat of what we did 
a few weeks ago but at a more basic level.  We were thinking that it may be 
beneficial for Nidia Mendoza and Cathy Tudon.  Let me know what you think.

Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following 
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Who on the commercial side is deciding who the CA would be?  As I explained 
to Nora yesterday, I think that the Enron CA should the Enron entity whose 
commercial people will be in charge of this deal after it is closed.  As far 
as 2(c) is concerned, would this require us to hand over confidential 
information?    Is Section 3 the business deal if someone other than Enron is 
the CA?  With respect to Section 7, in Section 7(a) shouldn't the term "Event 
of Default" be tied to the Events of Default in the Swap Assignment?  With 
respect to Sections 7(b) and (c), I just want to make sure that everyone is 
okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since 
I would think that this is something that we would not want to happen.  For 
example, 7(b)(ii) seems to be a trigger that could accidentally happen and 
the removal of Enron as the CA seems to be a harsh penalty.  I'll defer on 
this to whatever you and the commercial folks want to do.

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss
possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin

I will take a look at the Guaranty and get back to you but my recollection 
was that the termination provisions did not make clear that the Guaranty 
would remain in place with respect to obligations that arose after the 
termination date with respect to transactions that were entered into prior to 
the termination date and taht was the concept that needs to be addressed.

Susan,
Carol,

I reviewed this response from the credit person at WPS, I have looked at the 
Guaranty we receive from them with respect to the paragraph he refers to, I 
do not know if the particular sufficient satisfies your request or if your 
requested language stills needs to be inserted.

Please advise,
Russell

Russell,

There is already language in the Guaranty that acknowledges and guarantees
payment of WPS ESI obligations and liabilities under terms of the
"Agreements".  You request only restates what has already been defined and
agreed to.  I don't understand why it needs to be stated again.

Carol:  I apologize for being deliquent in getting you a draft of a waiver 
letter for our representation of ENA in the ACE insurance transaction, but I 
have had an incredibly hectic two weeks.  This draft is virtually the same as 
the other waiver letters I have prepared for ENA over the years, with the 
notable exception of the acknowledgement that certain LLGM lawyers can review 
the insurance status of the policy for ACE from an insurance status 
standpoint.  As you know, I was not particularly thrilled about having us 
perform that role, but I understand that this issue was vented in 
considerable detail a week or so ago and agreed to by both parties.  Please 
let me know if this letter is acceptable to you.  If it is, perhaps you could 
just reply to this e-mail and I can then forward an original to you via fax 
for your signature.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Thanks very 
much for your time and consideration in this respect.  And, thanks for 
providing us  with the opportunity to work with you on this project.

 John Hancock is insisting that we resurrect the termination for
illegality provision from the Master and put it in the Swap assignment
agreement as an option for the Trust to terminate the Swap and trigger an
appraisal if there is an illegality event.  Does Enron have an institutional
problem with this if the commercial and legal people are comfortable with it

I understand that we want to put a second Raptor transaction in place before

from the UBS position will be involved. 

Anne, Will we be getting a fairness opinion on this deal? We also need to 
think about whether we'll need to get full board or executive committee 
approval.

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.
Thanks and regards.

It would help if in whatever you send to her today that Enron preserves its

I called Ferrellgas for Margin yesterday, 6/15, for COB 6/14.  However, 
today's MTM is under the threshold, thus no longer resulting in the need for 
Margin.  I spoke with Erin Hamilton at Ferrellgas and she requested 
confirmation, using today's MTM, that the previous Margin call should be 
cancelled.  Should there be any specific language used in a cancellation 
confirmation about reserving the right to call for Margin in the future, even 
though we will cancel the Margin call for COB 6/14?  Please let me know your 
thoughts.

Susan and Susan:
Could one of you send out a notice concerning the following and update lotus 
notes:

1. Oneok Gas Marketing Company has changed its name to Oneok Energy Marketing 
and Trading Company, II ("Oneok II").

2. K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading 
Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP") 

We have Masters with both of these entities.

I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the following 
will occur once it becomes effective:

1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to 
Oneok LP.

2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the 
Oneok II Master.

In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok 
LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes 
from the parent Onoek Inc.

Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.

Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.  We need to use our form as it 
ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.  Legal will dela with 
Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.  His form, I 
suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.  I am alos 
attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and 
the Counterparty Guaranty.

I have spoken with Dave Kistler about the form of CA that you sent to him.  
What we prefer to do is to use the form that was agreed to a year ago (a copy

or (2) since this CA does not expire for another year, do a side letter that 
provides that the term "Project" as used in this CA means both the project 
that is currently described and the new project that we are about to engagae 
in with you.  Please let me know your preference.  My number is 713-853-3989.

something credit can send to counterparties?

Just a reminder that we need to discuss matters relating to Occidental (their

respect to Aquila/Utilicorp,  apparently they cannot have all of the online

guy that needs to authorize the sub-user accounts is not in the office until 
Tuesday.  The current plan would be for them to do that on Tuesday and then 
to make the switch from Aquila to Utilicorp effective next Wednesday.  I'll 
keep you posted but we still have not declared the Utilicorp ISDA effective.

done to 1 or 2 counterparties.  Thanks.

Brad and John:
We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification 
on the following points:

1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial 
combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?

2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical 
master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our 
exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although 
the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose 
exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?

Jeff:
Just a few comments:

1. In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words "due to" 
need to be put after the word "means" in the first line.

2. In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae "as it relates to 
the Assigned Interest" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier comment 
on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment 
piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that 
happens to Pelican .  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese 
explain why.

3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the 
first sentence of such Section "the amount determined..." shouldn't it say 
"the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the 
Transaction".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters 
and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or 
Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events 
occur.  What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each 
party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just 
determine it?

Stacy:
I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we 
need to do 2 things to the existing language:

1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's 
Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is "Exposure".

2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of 
subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.

We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the 
draft that we send out.

Carol

	John Suttle
	06/19/2000 08:29 AM
		
Carol,  

Sorry for the confusion.

1) Yes - the guaranty should cover both contracts - $75MM to cover the 
aggregate $50MM threshold.
2)  I spoke with Jeff Hodge on whether or not this would work prior to 
sending worksheets to you guys.  The idea is that there is a $50MM aggregate 
threshold for the counterparty.  The ISDA will be a normal ISDA - with a 
$50MM threshold.  The Master Physical will be the document that needs to be 
customized to the new concept.  The Master Physical threshold language is to 
simply read that there is a $50MM threshold less any exposure under the ISDA 
collateral threshold.  I understood that Stacy or Jeff would adapt the Master 
Physical to address any legal language differences in the contracts  - i.e. 
"Exposure", "Termination Amounts" etc.   Your team needs only to provide the 
ISDA to Stacy Dickson's group, and I believe they will draft the Master 
Physical to their comfort level.  

Please call me to confirm whether or not you need anything else on this  - 
and whether or not you think it can go out today.  

Thanks,

John

Brad and John:
We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification 
on the following points:

1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial 
combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?

2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical 
master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our 
exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although 
the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose 
exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?

Carol

Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following 
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Jeff:
While I don't quite follow how terminating the Fixed taints the Floating 
since we have separated the 2, I am okay with this if this is how our

Thanks for your comments.  A new draft should be out shortly that addresses
your comments.  Re the deleted language in 3.4, it is considered essential
that nothing can happen to terminate the Fixed Payment side of the Swap
since this could arguably taint the Floating Payment obligations.  The
investors are very sensative to this concern and I'm not sure we care.  Let
me know if you disagree.
Jeff:

Carol,

Paul VanderMarck forwarded to me your e-mail (see below) regarding the
confidentiality agreement.  We are fine with entering into a new
confidentiality agreement, based on the form agreed to by the parties a
year ago, however, a couple of changes to the form are needed.

1.  We would like to make sure that our definition of confidential
information is expanded to include our "cleaned" historical weather data
("Weather Data"), weather-risk internet application ("Web Site"),
associated methodologies, user identification codes, and passwords.

2.  The purpose of the disclosure of RMS confidential information would be
to enhance Enron's understanding of RMS technology and services and their
uses within the marketplace.

3.  Enron is granted by RMS, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to
use the Weather Data for internal evaluation purposes only.  Enron agrees
that it will not modify, create derivative works of, or distribute the
Weather Data to any third party.

4.  Enron agrees to provide RMS with its comments, criticisms, and
suggestions for changes with respect to the Weather Data and Web Site,
including identifying any errors or malfunctions in the operation thereof.

If you can include these items into the new confidentiality agreement
(based on the one the parties executed a year ago), we would be agreeable
to signing it.

Also, our CEO and CFO will be traveling next week.  If it is at all
possible, we would like to get this confidentiality agreement from you no
later than mid day  (PST) on Friday, April 14, 2000 to secure the
appropriate RMS signature.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I can be reached at (650)
617-6593.  My facsimile is (650) 617-6565.

Thank you.

I have spoken with Dave Kistler about the form of CA that you sent to him.
What
we prefer to do is to use the form that was agreed to a year ago (a copy of
which I have attached).  We can either (1) do a new CA based on this form
or (2)
since this CA does not expire for another year, do a side letter that
provides
that the term "Project" as used in this CA means both the project that is
currently described and the new project that we are about to engagae in
with
you.  Please let me know your preference.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Could one of you send out a notice concerning the following and update lotus 
notes:

1. Oneok Gas Marketing Company has changed its name to Oneok Energy Marketing 
and Trading Company, II ("Oneok II").

2. K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading 
Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP") 

We have Masters with both of these entities.

I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the following 
will occur once it becomes effective:

1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to 
Oneok LP.

2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the 
Oneok II Master.

In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok 
LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes 
from the parent Onoek Inc.

Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my 
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password 
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set 
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he 
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those 
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the 
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from 
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and 
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is 
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but 
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you 
know when that date is.

Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.

Hi Carol.  I will review the comments promptly (I've been on vacation so
any delay was fine by me).  Regarding the cross-default, I will need to
discuss it internally, and get approvals, but the collateral provision is
not a core policy so we will certainly think about it.  In any event, now
that we're getting close, I think it may be a good to have another
converstation to discuss where we are on the remaining issues. Please let
me know your availability.

Thanks and regards,

Jeff:
As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.
Carol

Mike:
I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves, our credit person, 
and we are okay with the concept except that we would like for the ratings 
trigger to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a failure to 
have an S&P rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we put in 
place a CSA, that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral 
threshold:

BB to BB+  $2,500,000
Below BB  Zero

I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our form of Credit 
Support Annex?

Hi Carol.  I will review the comments promptly (I've been on vacation so
any delay was fine by me).  Regarding the cross-default, I will need to
discuss it internally, and get approvals, but the collateral provision is
not a core policy so we will certainly think about it.  In any event, now
that we're getting close, I think it may be a good to have another
converstation to discuss where we are on the remaining issues. Please let
me know your availability.

Thanks and regards,

I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the
only
open points relate to :

1.   the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think
about what I e-mailed to you?

2.   DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the "materially
weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.

3.   Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation
procedures.

4.   DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext.

At long last I have had an opportunity to review the Multi-Purpose Form of 
Guaranty you circulated in early June.  I am fine with that form as something 
that we can use and that Credit can send to counterparties.

As an aside, the attached e-mail indicates that you forwarded something 
yesterday.  If so, I did not see that.

I join in Leslie's request to be forwarded a copy of the final form of 
guarantee.  Should you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 
your convenience.

Thanks,

Jeff

As we discussed, Elizabeth and I are fine with the Cross-Commodity Guarantee 
you circulated yesterday.  (By the way, we are revising our current physical 
power guarantee to eliminate the 15-day cure period.)  One question:  Is ENA 
the proper notice recipient in Section 7?  We direct notice to Enron Corp. in 
our standard form.  

After you have received Jeff's (et al.)  feedback, please send me a copy of 
the final form of cross-commodity guarantee so that we can include in our 
form file for all requests.

Thanks,

Leslie

Enclosed is Alan's response to the draft.

Do you know if Enron Corp is prepared to execute a similiar guarantee?

I believe that the introductory sections on liquids could be expanded to 
include, SO2 and NOx and other emission credit trading, coal, bandwidth and 
pulp, paper and other wood products trading.
	Alan Aronowitz
	06/21/2000 09:56 AM
		
I think this is a very good idea. I assume that Corp. will be willing to sign 
a reciprocal form of this Guaranty.

Yes, I believe coal, emissions, bandwidth and pulp & paper (?) should be 
added to the form in the "Transactions" paragraph as bracketed language that 
could be used as appropriate. Harry, I assume you will handle developing the 
language and submitting to Carol. 

Do you know if Corp. has signed off on the form yet?

Alan

	Harry M Collins
	06/21/2000 09:38 AM
		 
Please find attached for your review and approval a new multi-commodity 
guaranty, which has been developed by Carol St. Clair. This new form would be 
used for power, gas and liquids transactions.

I believe that it could also be used for emissions and coal transactions

Jeff has already signed off on this new format.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.

have not sent our form of Confirmation for several reasons as follows:

1) Trader wrote on ticket that MG was to Confirm the Transactions
2) We were unsure of MG's Legal entity name
3) No contact @ MG

Thanks for your message.  All El Paso wants to put in the LC form is language

We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty where 
we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that 
basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the 
rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to 
only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it 
were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted 
your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Carol, I spend 3.5 hours in the dental chair this morning and have a sore 
mouth, as well as cramps.  It's not one of my better days.  I also found out 
I have to have a root canal, 8 crowns, a fortune will be spent.  Anyway, she 
said the crown stuff would take 4 hours, which means 6-8, so I was wondering 
if you thought it better for me to take off when you guys weren't around.  
The week of July 17th, you'll be gone, Mary will be on vacation and Dan will 
be on vacation.  Would that be a good time for me to be gone too since it'll 
be quiet.  I have a lot of decay and need to get this over and done with 
soon.  After that's done, I should be finished except for routine cleanings.  
She's already done both side of my mouth.  Now, it's the front that has to be 
done.  I wanted to get your input before I started scheduling appointments 
where I'll have to be out an entire day.  

The Astros won last night and we were there!!!  We brought them luck!!!!!!

the recipient of such payment or a person related to such recipient, the
relevant date referred to in clause (x) and (y) above shall be the date
which is sixty days prior to the date on which a Transaction is entered

Pablo:
Weather derivatives are derivative transactions that we do with 
counterparties based on temperature chnages, rainfall amounts etc.  For 
example, a counterparty (i.e., a ski lift operator) may want us to agree to 
pay them within a certain seasonal period based on  the number of days that 
the temperature exceeds a certain level.  With respect to credit derivatives, 
these are again financial transactions that we may enter into with a 
counterparty where we may agree to pay them if an entity taht they have a 
relationship with goes bankrupt.

acceptable. Thanks. Henry (412-553-7711).

 <<E&P>>

Russell:
Based on my review of the 6/23 draft of ISDA Schedule here are my credit 
questions:

1. There is no Credit Support Provider for Equitable.  Should there be?

2. What should the cross default thresholds be and who should they apply to?

3. Are you satisfied with the Additional Termination Event?    I'm assuming 
that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense 
to take "future" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it asset 
sales made during the current year?  How will we know what assets sales are 
made?  Will the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report 
that we receive annually?  When will this calculation be done?  Are you 
satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?

4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report.  
Is that sufficient?  When should we get it?  Alos, whose financials do you 
want to receive?

5. In Part 5(c) - Setoff, I'll just note that this only applies to amounts 
due and owing between the parties and does not include "affiliates".  

6. In Part 5(f)- Assignment,  we need to decide what conditions precedent we 
want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given 
the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even 
the GP.  For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of 
the transfer?  It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the 
time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some 
minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.  In addition, are you 
satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations?  On asset sales, I think 
that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000 
limit currently works.  Alos, I think that all of these limitations in 
Section (f) should either be additional Events of Default or Additional 
termination Events.

Please call when ready to discuss.

Enclosed are what I hope will be the final drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph
13, LC provisions, and Schedule 1.

I have accepted and incorporated the new changes you made plus all the
changes which we have agreed upon.  I also changed the presentation of our
address in Part 4a of the schedule - it's the same information presented in
a more concise way.  Finally, I changed the signature block on the schedule
to eliminate EPME-Gas Company (it no longer exists) as a 'general partner" -
I don't know where that came from.

Also enclosed is our version of the Guarantee.  Please let me know if any
other changes are required.  If not, let's proceed with execution copies -
let me know if you want to generate them, or if you want me to.

in the Guaranty re setoff, defenses etc.  I will try to send you a revised 
Guaranty shortly.
Carol

Karen:
Here is our response to your e-mail comments:

1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the 
provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn 
upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent 
with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to 
those other sections.

2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am 
unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to 
amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is 
your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) 
of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.

3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default 
situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).

4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability 
issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master 
permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Carol,

I had hoped all was well with the First Amendment with TransCanada; however, 
they are now requested certain changes.  Therefore, I am forwarding this 
message onto you for your review and comments.

Just let me know what is decided so that execution copies can be generated.  

Thanks
Susan:

My apologies in advance for causing you more work!

Although TransCanada previously consented to the format of amendment proposed
by Enron, upon closer review of this document, there are certain changes
requires by TransCanada, prior to execution.

E.4.(a) - TEFP will not agree to this point.  Will Enron consider not 
including
this language in the amendment?

E.4.(b) - please redraft, so that a Letter of Credit (L/C) may be drawn upon 
in
the event of default, only if the L/C holder is owed money.

E.4.(c) - why does Enron want this change?

F. - please redraft so that an L/C may be drawn upon if there is an event of
default, only up to an amount equal to the exposure amount.  Also please 
remove
all references to 'transferable' throughout the L/C.

Thank you for your assistance.  Again, I am sorry to have reneged on our
agreement.

Karen

Scott:
I wasn't expecting a redraft from them until after our call as I think that 
the purpose of the call will be to respond to our markup.

What we have negotiated with Southern was limited to financial trades done 
under the ISDA.  This was a form that they sent to us that we revised.  It 
was my understanding that they were going to contact Leslie separately about 
EPMI physical trades and Stacy about physical gas trades.

Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC 
would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating 
from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit 
Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in 
Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the 
reference to "Goldman Group" to "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

Exhibit 2 is not yet sufficiently specific to carry the weight it is asked

Carol,

I left you a message last week regarding the enclosed letter.  You asked to 
see a copy...

Background: Enron and Bombardier developed a promotional campaign to help 
sell snowmobiles.  Retail customers who purchased snowmobiles from various 
retail vendors by October 1 were eligible for a $1,000 rebate from Bombardier 
if the subsequent November-March snowfall was less than 1/2 the average of 
the previous 3 years.  In October, Bombardier reported to us the number of 
snowmobile sales in each city covered under our program and paid us a 
predetermined premium for each unit sold.  In return, Enron was liable for 
potential payouts in each of the cities covered under the program (different 
payouts in each city depending on the number of Bombardier units that were 
sold in each city).

The settlement date for the program was June 14 - allowing for true-ups by 
the various weather services.  As of this date, we were responsible for 
payouts in 6 cities.  We sent prompt payment to Bombardier.

Current Issue:  Bombardier has requested that we send a letter to to them, on 
our letterhead, specifying the actual Nov-Mar snowfall amount in each city 
covered under our contract with them.  They plan to forward this letter to 
the stores that sold Bombardier snowmobiles under this program.  The impetus 
for this letter is that some customers in cities where snowfall exceeded the 
strike (no rebate payments due to customers) thought/think that they may be 
entitled to a rebate.

Here is the letter:

Of course, I am waiting for your response before I send this letter out.

Regards,
Gary Taylor

Two things:

* First, I will try to email this guaranty to you again, followed with
a fax.  Apparently both failed to go through yesterday.
* Second, I did some research and it turns out that our general
partner is El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company, and Cecelia Heilmann is an
officer authorized to sign for both this entity and the L.P..  So if you
want to alter the signature block reflecting this general partner, feel free
to do so.

Please let me know later this morning if you still did not get our Guaranty.

Karen:
Here is our response to your e-mail comments:

1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the 
provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn 
upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent 
with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to 
those other sections.

2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am 
unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to 
amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is 
your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) 
of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.

3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default 
situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).

4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability 
issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master 
permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Carol

Teresa:
As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about 
the maternity leave policy:

1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up 
at 100% pay.

2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would 
need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and 
justifying sick leave pay at 90%

3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence, 
whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current 
benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am 
on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I 
still eligible?

I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let me 
know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.  I am 
scheduled to meet with mark haedicke tomorrow afternoon at 2 to go over my 
plans.

Just 2 comments to this:

1. Should we mention their ability to exercise subrogation rights and the 
effect it may have on our counterparties?  This is really not a risk as much 
as it is a relationship issue.

2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I 
doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They 
really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to 
the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.

Carol:

Gaurav asked me to summarize all relevant risks associated with the Reliable 
Power Product for the Dash.  Please let me know if you think I should add or 
revise anything:

1.  Section 8.3 indemnity obligation -- We are required to indemnify the 
insurer from any third party claims arising out of the insurer's performance 
under the policy except for a claim by a swap counterparty based upon our 
refusal to pay out on the swap because the insurer denied coverage.  We hope 
to have a one-year limitation on this obligation; however, this limitation 
would be subject to tolling in an insolvency situation.

2.  The insurer is permitted to revoke coverage for up to one year if there 
is a fraud or material misrepresentation or omission by ENA in obtaining 
coverage.  (The current version of the policy also provides for revocation if 
the insurer subsequently discovers fraud on the part of the swap 
counterparty.  However, we intend to eliminate this from the insurance policy 
if possible.)  ENA is not limited to the group of employees administering the 
auction but rather includes the entire organization.  Therefore, we could pay 
out on a swap to a counterparty after the insurer had approved coverage and 
face a situation where the insurer changed its mind and decided to deny 
coverage based on, e.g., a material omission by ENA in failing to provide 
relevant information relating to coverage at the time the claim was 
presented.  Absent counterparty fraud, we would not be able to go back to our 
counterparty and demand reimbursement on the swap.

3.  Credit risk -- The insurer fails to pay out upon the occurrence of an 
Insured Event while we are required to pay out to our swap counterparty in 
the underlying swap.

4.  Loss adjustment credit risk -- If the price we use to pay a counterparty 
under the swap is subsequently corrected by the floating price source, we may 
be require to make a payment to our counterparty under the swap before the 
insurer makes a payment to us for the loss adjustment.  However, if the price 
adjustment results in a refund being owed to us by our counterparty, we may 
have to pay the insurer the amount of the refund before we actually get a 
refund from our counterparty.

5.  Under Section 6.1(b), the insurer can deny coverage based upon any breach 
of our duties under the policy.  For instance, if we fail to comply with the 
notice requirements for presenting a claim, we forego our right to coverage.  
However, we will still be required to pay out on the underlying swap.  

Leslie

Russell:
Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc. 
made 

1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations 
with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.

2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.

3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.

4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be 
a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.

5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the 
Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.

Carol

Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Russell:
Their attorney finally contacted me and we talked about the ESP rules.  She 
is going to do further research in light of the fact that for regulatory 
purposes Utilicorp, the GP, cannot furnish a Guaranty.  I alos mentioned to 
her that at the very least we would like to make Utilicorp a "Specified 
Entity" so that they would be part of the credit-related Events of Default in 
the ISDA Master.  As a general rule, we recommend in circumstances where the 
counterparty is an LP and you are relying on the GP's credit, making the GP a 
"Specified Entity" so that for example their bankruptcy would trigger an 
Event of Default.  Call me if you have any questions.

In response to the comments PanCanadian has with out ISDA;

1)  I can live with excluding obligations with Affilates, if it is defined 
this way in the Canadian Master.  Although I would like to know your thoughts 
on this.

2) The Minimum Transfer amount must remain ar $1.00

3) I can agree to the rounding of $100,000 for both counterparty's.

4) I will agree to the L/C Bank to be either a major US or Canadian Bank.

5) I can not remove the current ratio trigger, this company is a marketing 
company with large current assets and liabilities and this is a way to 
monitor the company's balance of receivables to payables.

Please call with questions

that before I go on maternity leave I can at least summarize what needs to be

David can finalize the chart with the other information that I have 
requested?  I am afraid that if we wait until you get back, I will be gone.

I will not be in the office next week, although I think we do need to get a 
game plan together to capture the counterparty's that need to be pursued with 
unexecuted confirmations.

Carol, maybe we can talk of the priority of counterparty's

Russell

I think that we should meet soon to resolve the current need
of obtaining exposures for our outstanding unexecuted confirmations.

Please let me know your availability for next week. 
I am suggesting Wednesday at 11am.

Thanks

Willie:
Thanks for your voice mail message.    As I explained to Joe and David, on 
all of the counterparties where we have "EOL Issues" I need to know what 
those issues are and then I will call them.  Could you please advise Joe 
and/or David about this and then I will follow up.  The only issue that we 
discussed was the issue that these counterparties are thinking that the 
clicking requirement in the ETA applies to confirms which it doesn't.  Thanks 
for your help.

Tanya:
Here are the credit related comments that we received from Quaker Oats' 
counsel:

1. They prefer Market Quotation instead of Loss.  This will obviously be a 
discussion point given the type of commodity that we anticipate. trading with 
them

2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount just for them of $250,000.

3. They want to reduce rounding to $25,000.

4. They do not want the provisions of section 6(c) of the CSA to apply at any 
time.

5. They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if 
there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to 
terminate and have a payment  obligation owing to us before we could draw.

6. They do not want any LC to be transferable.

7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return collateral 
taht has been posted to us, which I guess means that if we didn't return 
collateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount.  Without 
this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,  terminate and 
then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them.  To the extent that we 
were holding cash colateral, they could offset that amount against amounts 
that they might owe us.  This is an interesting issue and one that I have not 
seen before.

8. They want the Guaranty cap to be rased to $25,000,000.

Where does this ISDA stand on the priority list?  Is this something I should 
try to push forward in the next week or 2 while I am hear or can it wait?

Jaime:

counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?

Robert:
I am still waiting to hear back from our credit person on some of the credit 
comments that you made, but here is my response to the legal and certain of 
the credit comments:

1. I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.  I would like to talk to 
you about the second paragraph.

2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Loss rather than 
Market Quotation.

3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.  In addition. our tax people are now 
advising us to require the delivery of W-9's to part 3.

4. NY is okay with governing law.

5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go 
with our language and really didn't see much difference in what you sent 
other than the fact that it was more abbreviated. Did I miss something?

6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Business Days is too long.  How about 5?

7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is too narrow for us.  We 
can agree that any calls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing 
and financial/credit personnel will be recorded.  Does that work for you?

8. Insert 7 is okay.

9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,  

10. Your comments on page 4 of Annex A are okay.

11. Your comment on Annex A, page 5 is problematic for us unless we limit 
posted collateral to LC's only.    

12. On page 6 of Annex A, can we include both the Issuer and the pledgor?

13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining comments on page 7 of Annex A 
except that we need Moody's because it is used in the LC language.

14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put "either the Issuer or X" and in 
1(b) include your language as an alternative?

15. I need to discuss with you your deletion of clause (ii) of 1(d).  We 
would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occurred and if no 
payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash collateral.

16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in 
Section 2 of the Guaranty.

17. Inserts 10, 11 and 12 are okay.    

18. In Section 6(c), I would like to keep that phrase as it refers to the 
Payment Demand procedure.

19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.

20. We can change governing law to NY but as a matter of enron policy, cannot 
agree to Insert 13.

21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer 
that this applies in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar 
proceeding.

 I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum 
Transfer Amount comment, the LC transfer language comment and the language of 
Insert 9.  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will not be in the office 
monday or tuesday.  Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to 
include the following language at the end of Part 6.  Sorry for the late 
notice.

After reviewing heir form of Guaranty, I would prefer that we use our

Thanks Carol, I understand you are only focusing on the Online transactions, 
and all I ask from you is the clearance to do Online transactions.
Regarding Credit, Rod Nelson has been supporting us and he is leaving all the 
pending things to Paul Radous.  Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his 
view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the 
same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are 
ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that 
happening is very little.  He was going to put together an opinion froom 
their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning....
I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara.

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement

Steve and/or Rhett:
We are trying to finalize an ISDA with the above counterparty which is  a 
Bermuda company.  They made 1 tax comment to our Schedule.  Currently, they 
rep to us that Each payment received or to be received by them in connect 
with the Master Agreement will not be effectively connected with its conduct 
of a trade or business in the US.  They want to add the following to this rep:

Each payment to be received by it in connection with the Master Agreement 
will be either foreign source income under the Code or portfolio interest 
within the meaning of Section 881(c) of the Code or gain derived from the 
cash settlement of an option.

Is this okay?  As my days are numbered here if there is any way that I could 
get some feedback on this this week that would be great so that at least I 
can respond to them.  Thanks.

Luanne:
I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part 
where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our 
discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support 
provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one 
rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For 
this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall 
fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's. 

Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.

I am not a power expert (Sara Shackleton in our group handles the power 
trades) and would feel better if Christina Yoder took a look at this.  I 
understand he will be back in tomorrow and I have left him a voice mail 
message about this.  With respect to the form of Proposal Letter, I would 
prefer that you use the form that I have attached.  With respect to the 
proposed Term Sheet, the paragraph before the "Corrections to Published 
Prices" paragraph refers to an Annex A which if this deal is confirmed under 
an ISDA would not be the correct reference.  Also,  in the disclaimer at the 
end, please change all references of "Williams" to "ENA."    Please call me 
if you have any questions.  If this cannot wait for Christian, perhaps Shari 
Stack could look at it.  Let me know what you want to do.

I will do that.  Just to clarify, he will need to sign off on all of the 
changes, which I hope I can walk him through.  The only language that I am 
concerned about is what I have marked as "under review".  I will copy you on 
what i send to him as I will edit your draft to make my changes.  I will be 
leaving to go on maternity leave shortly (probably no later than July 14th) 
and if for some reason we don't conclude this, Mark Taylor will handle

Carol, please go ahead and have the 'under review' sections of the draft
read by the Enron Online person for approval, as the remaining comments are
not contentious.
I will send the mark-up to Marketing to see while we await for your reply.

Thank you

I run this by the Enron Online person for approval.

                    "Love, Anne"

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement

As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my 
records in various stages of negotiation:

1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 
15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from 
her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have 
been run by Dave.

2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of 
which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and 
have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run 
by Dave.

3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has 
approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne 
Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 

4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.  
Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded  
to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further 
on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.

5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st 
which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave 
has not reviewed their comments or my response.

6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't 
think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality 
language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to 
life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.

7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John 
Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.

8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th 
which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.

9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My 
contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and 
mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to 
Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.

All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my 
directory under specproj/online.

Luanne:
I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part
where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our
discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit
support
provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one
rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For
this
reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall
fail to
have a rating from either S&P or Moody's.

Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.

Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which 
counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern 
information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and I 
have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want 
the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

Hi,
I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't 
understand why Russell would not
want to provide this exposure information to us.

As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a 
date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.

I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a 
'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
on the following spreadsheet.

I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.

Thanks
David
How did things get settled between Carol and Russell?   Looking over the 
spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which 
counterparties we consider "Credit Concerns", where you would then prioritize 
on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we 
consider them to be "Good Credits" (for example Duke).  Once again, financial 
exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.  
Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated 
for more than a week, at the max.

Let me know how you want to go about this.  I think if I highlight which 
counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.

Regards--VE

Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and 
an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien" issue in light of the fact 
that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any 
agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the 
Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any 
comments.

Our commercial guys are in Philly today meeting with ACE to discuss an 
alternative online structure.  From what I know (which is very little at this 
point), because of the amount of time that it takes to implement the auction 
process online, our guys are looking into with ACE whether this product can 
be offerred pursuant the normal posting procedures that we use for most of 
our financial online derivative transactions.  Leslie and I are scheduled to 
meet with them tomorrow at Noon Houston time so if you are available and we 
can hook you in, let me know, otherwise one of us will catch up with you.  I 
would alos think that we could discuss the revised policy at that time since 
I don't think much will change if we go about it this way.

I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the 
following in connection with my leave that you have approved:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on 
adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 
2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.

2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence.  
Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am 
not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just 
pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you 
informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.

3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should 
know more after next Wednesday.

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday to meet, particularly in light of 
the luncheon with your group that we are having.  Is that okay with you?  In 
the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master 
and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken 
with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also 
have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

I expect to receive from our counsel in Mexico a memo addressing all of the

spoke with them yesterday about this.  I will need to review the memo with 
them and Mark Taylor to make sure that all of the issues have been adequately 
addressed and to determine if any changes need to be made to the documents.  
From my conversations with them, there don't appear to be any major issues 
other than the fact that we cannot offer "securities" to Mexican 
counterparties and they will define in the memo what products would be 
considered securities, but I want to see waht they put down in writing before 
we make any conclusions.  I or Mark will keep you posted.

Russell:
Here is a summary of the ownership chain of Global Companies LLC:

1. Its members are Global Petroleum Corp. ("GPC"), YPF Distribution Company 
("YPF") and Montello Oil Corporation ("Montello").  From what they sent to 
us, I could not tell the ownership percentages.

2. The affairs of Global are managed by a "Board of Governors" who are 
selected by the members.  Specifically, GPC and Montello collectively get to 
choose 3 board members and YPF gets to choose 3 board members.

I your credit worksheet, you had specified as a "MAC" trigger if YPF, SA 
fails to own at least 51% of Global Companies.  Is this the same entity as 
YPF Distribution Company?  Do you want this as a MAC or as an Additional 
Event of Default or Termination Event?

David:
Mark and I were reviewing the Eligible Swap Participant rules and the 
following issue came up:

If our counterparty is a limited partnership but our credit group is relying 
on the credit of the GP, do the rules require a written guaranty from the GP 
or is it enough to rely on the fact that under law the GP is jointly and 
severally liable for the LP's obligations?  One of our counterparties is a 
limited partnership whose GP is a utility and their counsel has advised us 
that for regulatory reasons, the GP cannot enter into a Guaranty.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.

I'm assuming that I will be gone when the closing sets for raptor II are sent

Mr. Davis:
Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me 
when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that 
we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that 
if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all 
of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were 
entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are 
incurred after the termination date.  I do not feel that the termination 
language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly 
reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the 
Guaranty "is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or after 
the termination date."    I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi,
Jeff asked me to forward the new report to you.

Here is the format of the new report and a brief description of each tab:

1. formerage-Willie's prior aging schedule. Do we want to see this for each 
c/p? I think it would be helpful
2. aging-Current aging schedule by year
3. STC-Dcaf-Current physical STC information from Dcaf
4. STC-Tagg-Current physical STC information from tagg
5. financial-Current and new format. If you move the lower bar to the right 
of the gray boxes, you will see the new columns
     which we've discussed.

I completed the master agreement column from the Lotus Notes database;

We are currently waiting on credit for the exposure information and their 
assessment (e.g. 'credit concern', 'good credit', etc.);

Tagg is able to provide term information for each counterparty, but since it 
is a time-intensive process, Ron Nolte is looking
into adding a button in tagg that will allow this and/or create a special 
customized ongoing report;

I am in the process of completing the remaining two columns (i.e. do they 
sign confirms?, if they don't, reasons why?)

Overall, I think that this new format, including my proposed aging schedule, 
will be a valuable 'tool' for all involved in our
follow-up work. 

Thanks
David

David:
Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which 
counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern 
information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and I 
have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want 
the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

Hi,
I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't 
understand why Russell would not
want to provide this exposure information to us.

As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a 
date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.

I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a 
'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
on the following spreadsheet.

I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.

Thanks
David
How did things get settled between Carol and Russell?   Looking over the 
spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which 
counterparties we consider "Credit Concerns", where you would then prioritize 
on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we 
consider them to be "Good Credits" (for example Duke).  Once again, financial 
exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.  
Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated 
for more than a week, at the max.

Let me know how you want to go about this.  I think if I highlight which 
counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.

Regards--VE

David:
I will try my best to meet but I need to devote as much attention as possible 
next week to the other projects that need my attention before I leave.  I

If you look at the stc(sent to c-party)-dcaf tab, you will notice that the 
numbers are decreasing due to amendments
being signed by counterparties for negative confirmations.

Once we move forward with the new financial spreadsheet, I'm confident that 
we will see the financial
numbers decrease as well.

I'd like to meet once before you leave if possible to wrap-up our discussions 
on a few critical counterparties
which were close to an agreement with us including Morgan Stanley (who were 
not signing confirms and were
sending back there own form of confirmation which wasn't allowed)

Thank you,
David

Susan and Samantha:
This is a file that apparently Shari worked on and Susan Flynn gave to me.  I 
have resolved the last tax issue and I will mark up the existing draft which 
then should be ready to sign.  There are some Guaranty issues that I need to 
take care of but in the meantime I will need one of you to revise the draft 
and coordinate getting it signed by the counterparty.

Carol

Tana:
I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did 
send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files 
near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we 
resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm 
not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now 
with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted.

that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done

1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of 
amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me 
their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the 
Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 

2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the 
Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the 
Engage Canada financial transactions.

I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will 
be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master

can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue 
remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause.

Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium.

We are fine with proposed amendment, item (2) in the June 14, 2000 letter.
I don't understand the purpose for the increase to $10 million proposed in
item (1).  Is this based on current business or some internal credit policy?
My records show, with the exception of June, ESI is in a net sell position
pretty much through the term of the Guaranty.

Please advise and provide your detail if you show otherwise.

Brant:
Please call me about this.

My understanding is it stayed with Columbia and we have continued to transact 
under it.  I do not know The New Power Company; Brant would probbaly be the 
best person to review the credit and determine if we are OK with the 
assignment.  Why are they sending us "notification" - don't they need to 
obtain our consent?

Thanks,
Tanya

No problem on the crib.  As for Mexico setoff, I am aware.  I was under the 
impression that even setoff among common entities is questionable.  My 
rationale is that we will almost certainly trade with any given cp through 
one Enron entity or the other, and not both.  If I am wrong, we will manage 
the process internally (i.e. cut the cp's credit line in half).

I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI 
Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered 
both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has 
been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add 
language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would 
prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that "The Guaranty of

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

Luke:
Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:

1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.

2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M 
if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.

3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our 
rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that 
is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only 
be on the Guarantor's right to assign.

4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.

5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following:

Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we 
discussed, I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note 
that since May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated 
our forms and I have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) 
and (b), part 6, Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  
Alos, I have made the chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are 
those chnages also acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?

I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity 
leave at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at 
713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get 
this finalized.

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Carol,

I've reviewed the attached questionnaire and have the following comments:

1.  Section 5. --  I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a 
non-Mexican entity to offer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties 
where such countparties are "vetted" before trading commences.  It seems 
that, for so long as derivatives are not offered to the public at-large, then 
such an offerings can be made.

2.  Section 9(c) -- A withholding tax, as well as value-added tax, will apply 
to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant 
to certain financial derivative transactions.  In addition, a non-Mexican 
entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty will be required to pay 
Mexican value-added tax pursuant to those certain transactions.  (Please 
refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments 
pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided 
to me by Jaime Williams will not be subject to any Mexican withholding or VAT 
tax since they fall outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such 
payments to Mexican tax.)  I have been working extensively with Mexican tax 
counsel on these issues, so please consider Rich, Heather y Mueller's "No" 
response as relevant only to a tax applicable to transactions conducted 
through the internet (and not with respect to the underlying transaction).

Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

Best regards.

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my

as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Thanks.  Is there a polite way to discourage flowers?  Bill is allergic and 
we just end up throwing them out after a day or 2.  Cash and diaper donations 
are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of 
stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail.  
On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send 
those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK?  
Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks 
until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so.  
Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm 
really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with 
my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can 
happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you 
have done.  Tell Ric I hope to see him at the club in a few weeks.

You should be getting lots of flowers and gifts because quite a few people 
have called for your address.  I see your email is working now.  How are 
things?  Did you talk to your mother-in-law?

It's been extremely quiet over here, but Susan Bailey is going crazy.  They 
must have given her what she wanted since she's still here.  No other news.

Good Morning,

She will get 8 weeks of sick pay. Please be sure that her time is coded as 
sick starting today.

Thanks

Michele, Carol had her baby last night and had to have a csection.  Does this 
add time to her maternity leave?  What about the other 26 weeks that we are 
given for illness.  She can't use them?  Suzanne (Carol's assistant)

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark

Suzanne:
Some of the 8 week sick pay will be paid at 100% (4 weeks I believe) and some 
at 90%.  Therefore, please enter my vacation time as vacation time so I get 
paid 100% and not 90%.  Thanks.  Call us if you have any questions.  Thanks.

If you don't want the flowers, call me and I'll come get them.  These people 
are paying tons of money for them and I don't want to see them go to waste.  
I'm by your house all the time.  I can just stand outside!  Susan Bailey is 
sending you something from that fancy flower store, I can't think of the name 
now.  Don't you dare throw that away, I'll rescue it.  Should I have them 
send chocolate instead?????????  I'll see what I can do if someone else 
calls.  Remember I'll be out tomorrow at the dentist.  I'm glad I can email 
you so I don't bother you calling.  I'll get your boxes to you this week and 
you aren't really getting much mail.

	Carol St Clair
	07/18/2000 05:32 PM
		
Suzanne:
Thanks.  Is there a polite way to discourage flowers?  Bill is allergic and 
we just end up throwing them out after a day or 2.  Cash and diaper donations 
are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of 
stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail.  
On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send 
those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK?  
Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks 
until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so.  
Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm 
really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with 
my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can 
happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

Tanya:
We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.  Just a few questions 
for you:

1. Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.  For some reason, they 
gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold.

2. I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to 
zero.  Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-?

3. For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P 
or A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?

4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?

the revised drafts. I don't think we're at a point to finalize. Russell and
Eqt. Energy's Elmore Patterson have not reached closure on credit
provisions. I think the other changes in the draft are generally ok or need
a little clarification, e.g. I don't see the relevance of adding Part 6(g)
and (h) as we don't trade in pulp or paper. Please let me know if we need to
discuss. Thanks. Henry. (412-553-7711)

I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note that since
May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated our forms
and I
have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) and (b), part 6,
Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  Alos, I have made
the
chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also
acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?

I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity

I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What 
a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except 
for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugene 
by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they 
tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of 
tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had 
some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing 
process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big 
help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur 
visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They 
spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and 
wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now until 
the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm 
looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid 
but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.

How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a 
place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August.  
Sue is Charles' godmother.

Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for 
thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.  Love, Carol

Dear  Carol, Bill, and Arthur...

Have been thinking of you and the impending "arrival" in a big way, these
days...and as a result, wrote a little poem concerning him....and you....here
goes....

                       TO THE CHILD
    You're coming soon, little one
       To fill their lives with love and fun
        and hope, and joy...
        Their second son.....
         You lucky, lucky boy!

                        TO THE PARENTS
            This gift from 'God
             is making his debut...
             In just a few days
              he's coming to you
              To be loved,
               to be fed,
                to be put to bed
                 with music and lullabies
                  and kisses when he cries....

                                    TO HIS BROTHER

                   You will help him
                     as he grows,
                    And love and protect him,
                     Heaven knows!
                     And there'll be no other
                      like his big brother!

                                      TO THE FAMILY AS ONE

                      So love him lots
                       with all your heart..
                       And help him
                        as he makes his start
                        into this world
                         so very strange
                         with every day,
                          some kind of change........
                           But, as one, I know
                            you wonderful "three"
                            Will adore this addition
                             To your "family tree".....

     With much love,
           Annie Bananie

 Hope all goes well for you, Carol.....You are always in my thoughts and
prayers....
  Let  me know when the great event happens.....

                                           .

Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% 
pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to 
ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it 
right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all 
small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning 
how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep 
some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on 
little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles 
sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to 
finish.

tell dan happy birthday and as for yours, i'll catch up as soon as i become 
more portable which should be soon.  as for flower pick-up, feel free to stop 
by after work whenever.  just call and let me know.  i've got 2 baskets that 
will probably only survive here another day or so so you are welcome to them 
and you can sneak a peek at charles at the same time.  

well i've got to go.  i'll talk/see you soon.

Well, I survived the dentist (7 hours in the chair),  Of course I started my 
period too, so I had cramps a backache and headache and my mouth open all 
going on at the same time.  It was NOT fun at all, but I made it through. 
It's nice to know the worst is over.  My temporaries look pretty good too.  I 
still have to go by the lab and do a couple of other things, but my permanent 
teeth should be put in on August 18th.  I'm just going to take the day too 
because lord only knows how long it'll take!  Then I'm finished until next 
year!  Whew!

I'll figure up 4 weeks of sick time and then I'll do your vacation and then 
do 4 more weeks of sick time.  I emailed Michelle Word from your email if the 
8 weeks were all 100% paid, so if you get that email, be sure and let me know 
what she says.  I'm trying to get you 8 weeks at 100% pay.  

It's pretty quiet around here so far today.  Dan's birthday is next Monday 
and we are going to take him to lunch and I'm getting him cigars (of 
course).  Mine is also coming up so Ric is going to take me to Pappas 
Steakhouse.  I've never been there and have been wanting to go.  He's already 
made the reservations and everything.  I can't believe I'm going to be 
45!!!!!!!  My body feels every year though!

How are you adjusting?  Charles sleeping any longer?  Keep in touch.  Oh, I 
received the thank you cards and will distribute them.  Thank you for the 
nice one to me.

I just heard you had you baby.  Congratulations.  

We are adjusting well.  Nearly finalized are apartment lease.  

Take care, maybe we can speak later.  Tell Bill hello.

Cindy:
Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a 
challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of 
schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are 
using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces 
should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should 
keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night 
owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy 
every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any 
suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret 
methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a 
pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at 
falling asleep on his own.

How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be 
sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into 
tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mother 
not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she 
took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care 
what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile 
which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.

Sue,
How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so 
that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill 
is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin 
something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.

Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and 
call or write me.

Love, Carol

Tanya:
I just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.  There is just 1 point 
that I want to raise with you.  You may recall that in Credit Event Upon 
Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their 
upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support 
Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BBB- or better OR Baa3 or 
better.  They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to 
the "transfer" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the 
other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee 
provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.  Are 
you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?  Our 
typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee 
provides a satisfactory guaranty to us.
Carol  

Rod:
Thanks for the info.  Our family doctor has recommended someone close by so 
we'll give him a try.  Hang in there on the moving details.  I know that 
things will settle down soon.  Things are great here.  Charles Eugene seems 
to be adjusting well and we are really enjoying him.  He'll be in his crib in 
a few weeks.  As for the swap group, yes they are thin but they appear to be 
hanging in there.  I spoke with Mark yesterday.  When I left, Sara was in 
London taking care of her mom who became very ill while ahe was over there.  
She is fine now and Sara is back but Mark pretty much had to handle things on 
his own for a few days.  He appears to have survived.  we just hired Susan 
Flynn's replacement so hopefully by the end of August the LA's will be back 
at full strength which will help out alot.  Take care and keep in touch.  You 
may be getting some e-mails from Mary Cook about some of my files which she 
has now inherited.

We used a pediatrician in Tomball, Dr. Carr.  Dawn liked him quite well (and 
I did too), but it's a bit of a drive.  I could ask my wife for other names?

I'm pulling my hair out with moving details - bank accounts, leases, 
shipments, tax forms ...  Sara tells me legal is pretty thin these days.  
Credit is the same in Houston.  Tracey is moving to Portland, Christopher 
left and John is moving to the Market Risk Group.  I got out just in time.

Just wanted to let you know that our son, Charles Eugene, was born on July 
12th.  He is absolutely beautiful and well worth the long wait and all of the 
time and effort that it took to have him.  After a prolonged stay in the 
hospital, we are both home now and doing really well.  I'm on cloud nine and 
I'm sure that all of this will hit me soon.  Hope you are doing well.  Take 
care.

Everything is fine.  Still on a hectic schedule but getting a little more 
sleep.  We take the baby to the pediatrician on Thursday for his first 
checkup and I go for mine on Friday.  I've started walking again and some 
very, very slow jogging (don't tell Bill this).  I feel really good and 
everything seems to be healing okay.  I've actually cooked a few meals!  I 
will try to call you in the next day or two.  We've been taking the baby out 
on short trips in the afternoon just to get out of the house.

How are things going?

Thanks for the e-mail.  Things are going very well.  The hospital stay was a 
little long but once we both got home things got much better.  I miss the 
work routine but I'm really enjoying my time with both Charles and Arthur, 
and of course Bill.  I hope to be up and around in a week or so.  my recovery 
has been slow and steady but except for a lack of sleep, I feel great.  Hope 
to be running soon.  I'll be up for a visit in a few weeks.  Take care.

Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time 
out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you 
sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to 
stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that 
talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift.  
Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we 
are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach 
normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we 
both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound 
since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough 
to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the 
christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for 
that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very 
much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.

Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I 
would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.

I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few 
weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do 
so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I 
should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I 
apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it?  
I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet 
(which I know you will).

As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family 
except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill 
that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty 
(and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given 
us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the 
doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I 
really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.

Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by 
for a visit.

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI 
Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered 
both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has 
been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add 
language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would 
prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that "The Guaranty of 
Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., 
formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is 
hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of 
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the 
obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed 
thereunder."  Let me know what you think.

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:

1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.

2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M 
if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.

3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our 
rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that 
is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only 
be on the Guarantor's right to assign.

4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.

5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following:

Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

Tana:
Here is where things stand on Engage:

1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of 
amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me 
their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the 
Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 

2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the 
Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the 
Engage Canada financial transactions.

I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will 
be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

I want to make sure that Jeff Richter from the power desk knows about this =
potential increased cost.

=09=09=09As you may know, at Jim's request, Stacey Bolton reviewed the rene=
wables language in SBX2 79 and SB 532 and identified some important issues.=
=20

=09=09=09In a memo she sent out yesterday, she detailed her concerns about =
these bills (copied below, for your reference). =20

=09=09=09How do you suggest we proceed?  Shall I arrange a brief call for u=
s with Stacey, Elliot, Mary and Jesse to discuss where we stand and strateg=
y going forward?

=09=09=09Jennifer =20

=09=09=09***************
=09=09=09Overall Concerns: =20
=09=09=09=091.=09The requirement for retailers to enter into a direct bilat=
eral for the power from renewable energy and schedule it into the CA grid p=
resents limitations and could drive up costs.
=09=09=09=092.=09It?s unclear if the REC is truly separate instrument from =
the underlying commodity.  The above requirement indicates that it is not. =
 This would negatively impact, and even negate the main reasons to have a R=
EC trading program - to provide flexibility and act as verification for the=
 RPS.
=09=09=09=093.=09The biomass definition is too limiting.  Would be difficul=
t to detail this amount of information on a REC.  Need to have language tha=
t distinguishes whether the REC is RPS eligible or not.
=09=09=09=094.=09Utilities are given preferential treatment in proposed lan=
guage in that utilities can recover costs through rate base and the Departm=
ent of Water Resources (SB 532 only) is instructed to purchase renewables o=
n their behalf if it is cost prohibitive for the utilities.
=09=09=09=095.=09While the cost cap is positive from a retail perspective, =
it might be out of the market from a wholesale perspective to cover the ren=
ewable premiums for new sources.

=09=09=09 -----Original Message-----
=09=09=09The concerns that I listed at the end of the memo are the ones tha=
t I believe need to be addressed and clarified if it appears one of these b=
ills are moving forward at a rapid pace.  Thanks!

Angela -

The value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA.  If a customer goes DA after August 24, 2001 (based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy Committee last night - with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the Governor), the customer would pay for SCE undercollection (PG&E isn't being discussed on this piece), DWR bond costs, and DWR net unavoidable.   The hardest piece to calculate - which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty - is the DWR net unavoidable.  If the customer has been DA since July 1, the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable (but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else).

Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be - the key question I'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open.

Of course, all of this assumes that the CPUC doesn't go back and suspend DA even earlier than July 1 or something else crazy happens - remember this is California.

Jim
EOP has been under contract since July 1, does that make a difference?

Thanks for the info.  While there may be some differences in presentation, there don't appear to be any basic differences in the analysis.  All of the discussions of the legislation need to be aware that the passage is highly uncertain.

I agree with the analysis that if you have never been DA and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge (assuming the legislation passes).  

Let me know if there is anything else.

Jim

Attached is a CA DA brief that Frank received from Les Spahn.  Les has opinions that are different from what we have been advising Frank and EOP.  I need your opinion on how to address these differences.  Thanks.
Frank_Frankini@equityoffice.com on 08/29/2001 11:55:15 AM
Gary, I need Enron's comments on this ASAP.
                    "Les Spahnn"
All:
A lot of runors are swirling around.  There is legislation pending right
now as I write this e-mail.  The outcome is uncertain.  But here is what I
know and what I have been working on for BOMA.
First, the CPUC continues to threaten that it will suspend DA on September
6th, including any DA contract signed since last January.  The PUC has
threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending
action on the issue by the legislature.  Even if the PUC were to act, the
legislature could override their action with a statute.  But I anticipate
that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering
the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September
14th.
The real action is in the legislature.  There is a comprehensive bill -- SB
78XX, the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison.
For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen, the Governor and the
Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison.  Here
are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it:

1) The state would securitize $2.9 billion in bonds to help SCE pay its
debts.  Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use 20kW or
more in peak daily demand.  That would translate to about 0.06 (as in
6/100ths) of a penny per kW.  The original proposal was to place the
bailout burden only on SCE customers who use 500kW peak demand, which would
have been maybe 1.5 cents per kW (since the base would have been much
smaller), but  we beat that back to the current proposal of 20kW.

2) The Edison surcharge would be non-bypassable.  That means that Edison
customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or
from a DA contractor.  If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the
Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying!

3) The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand (load) which
exceeds supply as calculated as follows: DWR contracts + IOU retained
generation + IOU long term contracts.  If this delta, or headroom exists as
of 1/1/03, then, per PUC regs,which are yet to be devloped, the Calif.
Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount
of headroom, without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee.  (An
exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a
customer for the customer's proportional share of the state's stranded
costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR, but for which there
is no market.)  If no headroom exists, a customer still could go DA, but
pay the exit fee to do so.

4) A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended.
Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to
1/17/01 to continue without penalty.  It looks like contracts signed
between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty,
but that date is not definite.  Contracts signed between June and August
24th would also be permitted, but may have to pay some sort of retroactive
exit fee, on a sliding scale, depending on the date they were signed.  All
DA contracts after August 24th would be subject to the 1/1/03 schedule
described in #3 above.

In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers, and exit fees for
DA customers when no headroom exists, there will be another surcharge for
all non-municipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since
January 17th.  That surcharge would be to payoff $13 billiion in state
revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR
bought since January.

Where does BOMA, and the rest of the business community stand on these
issues?

1) BOMA has been O.K. with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric
customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan. 17,
when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market
power.

2) While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR
long term contracts, we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for
them, and wants to be held harmless for their costs.  BOMA and other
business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated
or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without
exit fees.

3) BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any
surplus electricity revenues after the first $500 million to ratepayers
based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate
payments.  This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on
customers who have experienced rate increases greater than 50% in the last
few months.

4) Finally, BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison.  But the
Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone
he can see, including all business groups, to help get it enacted.  In that
light, BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers, residential as well
as business pay the debt.  The legislature, however, did not want to pass
this cost on to residential customers, so then it became a fight over where
the consumer threshold would be.  As stated above, we have suceeded in
getting it as low as 20kW peak demand.  (NOTE:  There are those that feel
it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to
get the state out of the energy business.  You can decide for yourselves.)

5) It should also be noted that the Edison, bond and DWR surcharges may all
be covered in the existing rates you are now paying.  That is to say that
there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since
the market price for power has come down substantially.  But this remains
to be seen.

There is more to this package and moer to come i9n terms of changes.  The
committee is going back in at 6:30 this evening and we will see what
happens.  I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation.

For the Monthly Update.

Jim - Attached are two documents.  The IRTF will give you a picture of whta is being done in the region with respect to my direct reports.  The second document reflects the business opportunities that I am currently working on with ENA and various companies.  As always please don't hesitate to call should further discussion be needed. Thanks and sorry for the delay SM

 

On coalitions, I was thinking about other market participants.  Agreed that=
 Cinergy could be the vehicle.  Also, maybe make an informal presentation t=
o FERC before any filing, etc.

Jim

I think we should try to get a coalition tgether, but I would be more incli=
ned to approach the Michigan and Indiana Commissions than Ohio or Illinois.=
  On a separate note, the advantage of an investigation over a complaint is=
 that we dont have the burden of proof and getting the info to concretely p=
rove what we suspect can at times be difficult if we go the complaint route=
.  Depends on the facts and the case. the meeting with Cinergy could be a g=
ood entre into getting a coalition together to approach FERC.=20

I'd say we want tariff language before any investigation.  I don't typicall=
y like investigations.  I like complaints.  My thought is to pre-sell tarif=
f changes to FERC with a broad coalition and then get the Ohio PUC to ask F=
ERC the question.

Jim

Then I will pursue getting an investigation and if we get one, we can devel=
op the model to push in that case.  I am assuming by model tha you are refe=
rrring to a mechanism that works for the midwest apart from or in conjuncti=
on with the ISO.  I will be with Mike and Jeff Merola tomorrow and will get=
 started on working on this with them.

We need a model for the entire Midwest independent of the ability to change=
.

Jim

At this point we dont have draft language and we dont have a settlement wit=
h language that allows us to push the way we can in Ohio.  My thought was t=
o push for an investigation and see within that context how far we could go=
.  At a minimum, if a hearing were to be granted, I think we could end up i=
mproving the balancing rules for IP, CILCO, etc.  Com Ed has the most favor=
able provisions and could end up being the model.  In my discussions with J=
eff Merola and Rogers Herndon, they can work with this however it is not op=
timal.  They need to do a transaction in order to figure out where the bugs=
 are.

Janine --

If we have draft tariff language, I'd push pretty hard.

Jim

On Friday, I participated in ICC Chairman Mathias' Roundtable on the state =
of competition in Illinois.  One of the questions he asked was what the ICC=
 could do to improve competition in Illinois.  I commented that the ICC cou=
ld commence an investigation on the balancing rules of the various utilitie=
s, having pointed out the problem's with ComEd's and the fact that the othe=
r utilities are even worse.  He expressed concern over ICC jurisdiction and=
 opined that to the extent that it impacts retail transactions and adversel=
y affects retail competition, the ICC is within its jurisdiction to order t=
he utilities to file an amended OATT before FERC for FERC's approval.  I pl=
an to follow-up with a letter to him and all the Commissioners and would li=
ke feedback as to how hard I should push on this.  Should the ICC look into=
 balancing (to which I give a less than 50% probability) we would have to b=
e prepared to participate.  I think it would be highly worth the effort, es=
pecially as far as Illinois Power is concerned, however, I would like some =
feedback as to your views in order to guage how hard to push this.

Thanks,
Janine

FYI.  These bills are currently moving through the California Legislature.  Not sure if the bills will be signed into law.

Please call with any questions.  From my quick glance, only good news is that it appears that the Windfall Profits Tax would not apply to retail contracts in effect on date of enactment.

Jim

Attached, please find links to the amended versions of ABX2 2 (windfall
profits tax) and ABX2 65 (market manipulation).  The new version of SBX2 78
(MOU) should be available early tomorrow, however the amendments I faxed out
yesterday represent the only changes to the bill.

Bryan - 

Pls include on the Monthly update.

Jim

Jim, please see me about this issue.  As you can see, Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our 200,000 MMBtu/day of Block 2 capacity on El Paso.  In fact, I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March, even before we signed up for the capacity.  You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list.  I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far.

The CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies.  Their concern is not the same as PG&E's.  And to the extent anything is agreed to, reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms, and I don't think we want to go there.  We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PG&E and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived.

Steph - Leslie and I were just talking about this, and one thing we need to keep in mind is that any attempt to modify the PG&E recall rights would almost certainly be opposed by the CPUC, especially if it was to benefit Enron.  

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says "and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice."  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the "traditional rate making" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out. 

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

Regards,

Stephanie

Here is a short memo.  do you need more?
 << File: Stephaniememo.doc >> 

We you able to pull together a clear, definitive conclusion on how the RE-recall rights work?
I was not able to - hence my mission for greater clarification of specifics....

I looked over all the orders and the contracts and I agree with both of your interpretation of the recall rights of Block II.  PG&E did not make a very smart deal for $58 million.
Page 12 talks about Recall rights - good discussion but still short on re-recall rights.

Our EES folks want to know if anyone within Enron was involved in Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania Tariff changes.
Please let me know what should I answer.
Thanks
Guillermo

Can you determine if anyone within Enron was involved in these proceedings? This tariff change could be significant and this is the first we've hard of it.
Please let me know.

Janine:  Was anyone in regulatory involved with this?  We found out this was coming last week at the CPA Shipper meeting.  This is going to cause a curve shift which could have been minimized had we known it was coming.  Thanks!  mde

Josh,

Please make sure you are on Shirley's mailing list, I didn't see your name listed.

Thanks

The following notice was posted on the Nominations Electronic Bulletin
Board today:

On October 12, 2001 the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved
Columbia's tariff filing to become effective on October 22, 2001, subject
to an Administrative Law Judge Recommendation.  This tariff filing includes
several changes that may be important to suppliers, such as changes in
Columbia's banking and balancing service, introduction of a new Flow Order
Management Service, and a new Imbalance Trading Service.

The full text of Columbia's original tariff proposals, as filed with the PA
Public Utility Commission on August 22, 2001, can be accessed at the
following site:

                                     h
ttp://www.columbiagaspamd.com/products_services/tariff_revisions_effective_oct.htm

Shippers serving aggregation pools on the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania,
Inc. system should carefully review Columbia's new Elective Balancing
Service (proposed tariff pages 164 - 169) and choose one of the three
balancing service options for each aggregation pool.  Also, suppliers who
have been designated as an authorized agent for non-aggregated customers
may choose an elective balancing option on behalf of those customers.
Columbia's current estimated rate for Option 1, Full Balancing Service, is
as follows:

SGS, SDS Customers  $0.20/Mcf
LDS, MLS  Customers $0.10/Mcf

Please note that Columbia's interruptible banking and balancing service
will no longer be available.  The cost for the interruptible service
($0.1109/Mcf for SGS and SDS, and $0.0358 for LDS and MLS) will be removed
from customers' distribution rates when the new Elective Balancing Services
become effective.

Under the newly approved Elective Balancing Service (Rider EBS), customers
or their authorized agents are given 20 days in which to elect their
service option.  Customers or their authorized agents who do not elect one
of the three Elective Balancing Service options on or before November 12,
2001 will default to Option 1, Full Balancing Service.  Columbia will post
final rates for Rider EBS Option 1 by the close of business on November 15,
2001.  If the final rates exceed the above estimated rates by more than
20%, customers or their authorized agents who have elected Option 1 may
change their election by submitting a change to Columbia in writing  by the
close of business on November 20, 2001.  Columbia will begin providing
service under the elected option as of December 1, 2001.

A form for the election of Rider EBS options will be e-mailed to the
"notices" contact person for each supplier that is active on the Columbia
Gas of Pennsylvania systemwhen it is available.

Please contact your Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. representative at
412-572-7117 with any questions relating to these new services.

Attached are the forms and a brief outline of the changes.

Lisa --

Rick Shapiro has offered to present.  I think that we can work up some presentation for 45 minutes.  Let's discuss soon the details. It is on his calendar.

Jim

The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.  Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.

There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.  In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.

Please call with any questions.

Jim

Jim,

I listened into the call for the PUC press conference and they plan to go forward with the vote tomorrow regarding direct access; however, they will not vote on the rate order until a later time due to the high volume of comments (they predict it will be voted on before Sept. 20th though.)  Let me know if you need more info about the call.  Thanks, A.      

Fine.

Jim

Jim,

Next week is the annual DSTAR meeting.  Our dues will be due on Sept 11, the fee is $250.00.  If there is no problem I plan on writing a check, obtaining a receipt and putting this charge on my expense report.  I just found out about this requirement, hence the late notice to you.  If there is any problem, please let me know.

FYI, the benefits that Enron would receive from this would be the ability to run for a place on the Advisory Board, which I am doing.  The Advisory Board works directly with the (currently not-so) independent DSTAR Board.  If anything, it gets us close to the ears of the decision makers and I would expect that after the TO's file in October the Board may regain some of their much needed independence, at which point we'd be in a good position to influence policy.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Michele & Rick --

Please see the note below.  It is critical for you to call your clients (Ja=

Call me at 713-853-7673 or 713-851-2499 (cell) to discuss. =20

Thanks,

Jim

Rick Simpson from the Speaker's office, said there will be no amendments to=
 the bill prior to its passing the Assembly.  They are still scrambling for=
 votes and sent the Chamber and WSPA lobbyists out to shore up a few while =
I was in the office.  I talked to Mike Kahl, WSPA lobbyist, whose firm also=
 represents the restaurant assn.  He argued that the 24th was in the bill f=
or awhile and he called all of their clients to tell them to sign up by the=
 24th.  He said Enron should have done the same.  I argued that Enron did t=
he best it could, but that negotiations with many entities take varying amo=
unts of time.  So long as the date is past, and customers still have to pay=
 exit fees, what was the relevant policy debate.  There can't be a gold rus=
h now.  Scott pointed out to me that bothWendy's and Burger King probably b=
elong to the restaurant assn., so our suggestion is that those entities con=
tact Jot Condie at the assn to instruct his lobbyists to change the date to=
 Sept. 1st.  This is time sensitive.  The Chamber lobbyist would love to se=
e a Sept. 1 date, but was not optimistic that they could move the Governor'=
s office.

Rick agreed to ask the Speaker to call Jeff Brown and ask for a delay until=
 the Legislature has time to act.  He will say the bill is expected to pass=
 his House tomorrow and changes will occur in the Senate which will give th=
em direction.  Rick also expressed pessimism that Bowen's attempts at legis=
lation will have a fruitful result.  I have been unable to speak to Burton =
directly about calling Brown, but hope to see him before the day is over.

Also I have a call in to Mayor Willie Brown, but so far I haven't heard bac=
k.

Jim, re the list of customers signing after July 1 - which ones would be af=
fected by the Aug. 24th date?

I've asked Sue Mara to try and develop through AReM some form of legal action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.

Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).  To make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).  I will leave it to Sue Mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a conference call to discuss the draft.

My choice would be to not have Enron file the paper, but rather work through AReM.

Thanks,

Jim

Christi --

I am comfortable with trying to settle.  I hate that this new Commission has to litigate this case.  It is important, however, that we focus FERC staff on the broader policy changes necessary throughout the industry and not just on Entergy's tariff.  

Jim

The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).

It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts? 

Christi -

Dan has informed me that Enron's share of remaining costs in the Enron v. FERC matter will not exceed $4,000, for the work done to prepare for oral argument scheduled for November 7, 2001.

If you need a more formal document indicating this, I would be happy to send one to you.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.  I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?

I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.

Jim

Dave and company,

Here we go again.  Dave, is this anything you want us to engage in?  Jim, what do you think about this?

The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
"retirement."

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to "integrated resource
planning."  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.

FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress,
with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.

CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to "integrated resource planning"
with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited
Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates
utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for
life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset
construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission,
etc.

CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for
reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re
economic projects.

CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract
amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision
based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions
could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties
remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on
ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract
amendments with SCE's.

CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation.
PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set
cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but
notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that
CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained
assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that
require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC
settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered
per that agreement.

Any insight into this statement about Whalley and Frevert?  I'm guessing that this is just Lay's vision of what is now impacting our company?  Appreciate your thoughts?

   Lay wasn't more specific about the two men's assignments.
     ``They'll be looking at all of the businesses -- the
wholesale unit, government affairs. Anything that affects Enron,''

Hi Sweetie --

Thanks.

Jim/Paul:

I think given Mary's work with the developers in CA on the environmental side that these kinds of issues are consistent.   I spoke with her today, and she'd be happy to help out.  She indicated she would try to get together with Sue Mara when Sue is back in the office.   After they meet, they'll come back with a plan for covering these issues and we'll bring everyone up to date.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff --

See below.  Does this fit into Mary's responsibilities?  Let me know.

Jim
FYI.  Can Mary Schoen help us out on this stuff.  We need to first evaluate the rulemaking against our interests, then determine whether IEP can handle it for us.  

A number of things are falling through the cracks --Dave Parquet's siting concerns is one of them.  I have had NO time to work on this stuff-- any suggestions? ANother one is EES's need to file data with the CEC -- I just realized I was waiting for something from EES months ago and never followed up. I'm sure there is more. 

Recently, the CEC initiated a Rulemaking on siting.  The purpose is to
review and rewrite the Commisison's Rules related to siting of new
generation.  As the Siting Committee has failed to convince the full
Commission of how best to proceed, the Commission is scheduling a Business
Meeting on Sept . 12 to discuss this matter and, presumedly, provide the
Commission direction.

Attached is a staff report laying out the issues.

IEP is monitoring this matter through its Regulatory Committee.  Presently,
staff plans to attend the meeting.  Comments on the staff report prior to
the Business meeting on the 12th,  as well as comments on other matters
related to the Commission's Rules regarding siting, would be advantageous.

IEP is interested in hearing from company's willing to fund a stronger
intervention (i.e. the development of comments, etc.) than mere presence at
the Business meeting.  Please contact Steven Kelly ASAP if your company is
interested in IEP developing comments on this matter.

BTW, I will be out of the office Monday-Thursday of next week.  I'll have a computer (if it works) and will call in for messages so if you need me, please leave me a message.  Thanks.

Can you give me a list of the gas contacts (desk heads) for trading and origination?  Thanks.

Your call.

We should determine whether we want to voice an opinion on this.  Seems there would be two issues  that might concern us:  1) bankruptcy and 2) effect on our book.  Might be useful to discuss briefly; perhaps first thing tomorrow morning.  Thoughts?

Best,

FYI
SNG LNG has made the necessary filing to place its FERC Gas Tariff into effect on the proposed in-service date of the Elba Island facilities, 12/1/01.   The filing (which is 311 pages) includes revised initial rates for terminaling service.  Most of the tariff was approved in the certificate proceeding.  Substantive changes are explained in Exhibit Z1, which is in Set 7 below.

These are links to the tariff pages.  The links will open in an imaging program.  Use Ctrl-Page Up and Ctrl-Page Down to move between pages.  If you want to print anything, use the printer icon on the tool bar above the page and select "fit to page" under the Imaging Options drop down menu.

I would probably utilize either EPSA or WPTF to make the filing.  This is an attack on the competitive generation industry and better to not have Enron point any fingers at a key "potential" customer.

Jim

Leslie,

I have just completed reviewing the APS filing.  This paper explains much of the observed behavior of APS during the DSTAR (WestConnect) proceedings over the last several months.

The paper is so full of market "scare" tactics it seems appropriate to be reading it during the Halloween season.  The token effort of procuring 270MWs starting 2003 and ramping up to 1670 MWs in 2008 is ridiculous.  The statements that APS generation is somehow more secure and reliable than any generation not owned by APS, using the same grid, and that non-APS generators have little if any responsibility to the "Full-Requirements" customers are all beyond belief.  

The mis-characterization of the problems experienced in CA, OR and WA and the contemptuous citing of "experts" seems typical of the APS distain for deregulation.

The entire filing is more like a guaranteed plan to recover the "Billion" dollars invested by APS, with convenient adjustment clauses every three years.

As you noted earlier today, the Commissioner of the ACC may be more concerned over the APS stock price than truly encouraging open markets and retail access and what better why to help the stock price than to award APS a 14 year contract...look at what the Defense Department did for Lockheed!!!

I spoke with Chris Lackey who met earlier this month with Pinnacle West's (APS subsidiary) head of Trading who told him that PinWest is very conservative (as stated in the filing), their primary function is to support APS and they saw no real opportunities to conduct business with Enron.  However that could change if their petition is denied.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.  If this is approved by the ACC I assume it must then go to FERC, do we have an opportunity to intervene with the ACC and/or FERC in regards to this filing?  If we do, I'll be happy to help you with composition of the documents.

Kind Regards,

Dave

I will be attending.  I'll cover.

Jim

It is on my calendar, but if you are participating, I probably won't since we are getting interconnection basic ideas ready for Thurs. FERC meeting.  Donna will attend the FERC Int. Meeting.

They are active throughout the West - mainly California.  We can use them.  Both are good.

Jim

I have not seen them active in state proceedings in the west where I have been.  Is that a problem?

I would probably utilize either EPSA or WPTF to make the filing.  This is an attack on the competitive generation industry and better to not have Enron point any fingers at a key "potential" customer.

Jim

Leslie,

I have just completed reviewing the APS filing.  This paper explains much of the observed behavior of APS during the DSTAR (WestConnect) proceedings over the last several months.

The paper is so full of market "scare" tactics it seems appropriate to be reading it during the Halloween season.  The token effort of procuring 270MWs starting 2003 and ramping up to 1670 MWs in 2008 is ridiculous.  The statements that APS generation is somehow more secure and reliable than any generation not owned by APS, using the same grid, and that non-APS generators have little if any responsibility to the "Full-Requirements" customers are all beyond belief.  

The mis-characterization of the problems experienced in CA, OR and WA and the contemptuous citing of "experts" seems typical of the APS distain for deregulation.

The entire filing is more like a guaranteed plan to recover the "Billion" dollars invested by APS, with convenient adjustment clauses every three years.

As you noted earlier today, the Commissioner of the ACC may be more concerned over the APS stock price than truly encouraging open markets and retail access and what better why to help the stock price than to award APS a 14 year contract...look at what the Defense Department did for Lockheed!!!

I spoke with Chris Lackey who met earlier this month with Pinnacle West's (APS subsidiary) head of Trading who told him that PinWest is very conservative (as stated in the filing), their primary function is to support APS and they saw no real opportunities to conduct business with Enron.  However that could change if their petition is denied.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.  If this is approved by the ACC I assume it must then go to FERC, do we have an opportunity to intervene with the ACC and/or FERC in regards to this filing?  If we do, I'll be happy to help you with composition of the documents.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Kevin --
 
Last update that I know about for CDWR costs.  If Sue or Jeff know of later $ figures, please advise Kevin.  Also, my understanding was that the CPUC simply disallowed the CDWR from having straight passthru without review.  They may get to charge 100% of these dollars, but needs CPUC approval.
 
Jim
I have attached a comparison of the revised CDWR Revenue Requirement, along with a comparison with the July 22nd figures.
 
* The total DWR dollars decrease $471.5 million over 2001 and 2002, centered in the periods 3Q 2001 and onward.  The "past problem" actually increases by $1.9 billion (1Q & 2Q 2001).
* PG&E has their share increased $730.1 million over 2002 and 2002, centered in 1Q and 2Q 2001.
* Edison ends up with a significant decrease of $1.199 billion in 2001 and 2002.

Let's set up the meetings.  Don't you think?

Jim
As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

As Project Lead of one or more of the proceedings that are currently underway at FERC, would you please send to this group a timeline (date of filing or date of FERC issuance, due date for comments, estimated date for FERC action) for each of the proceedings that you are the assigned lead.  For example, for RTO Week, the timeline would be:

Project:  RTO Week

RTO Week									October 15-19

Comments on RTO Week							November 3

Estimated Date for Draft Circulation (and who is responsible for the first draft)	November 1 (Sarah will write the first draft)

Estimated Date for FERC Action							Mid-December (which could be in the form of additional proceedings, such as a NOPR)

Because we have so many proceedings pending, and because FERC continues to change the dates for interventions and comments, this information will allow us all to keep on top of what needs to be done.

Please send your responses to this group by COB Wednesday.

Thanks

Sarah

I haven't processed a bill.  

Have you received and sent for processing a bill from watkiss for the PNW yet?  Someone sent a 137K bill to accounting for payment - I have received nothing yet from watkiss.

FYI.
Hey Gang,
 
On November 10th Enron will be hosting its annual fall softball tournament.  The tournament will be a one day event Barker Cypress Sports Plex on I - 10 ( instructions will be provided). At least 3 games will be played, winner takes all.  It is not mandatory that you participate in all of the games, but it is important that we field at least 9-10 individuals at all times.  There is a mandatory minimum of 5 women and 5 men permitted on the field at all times. If the team does not have enough female participants every inning will start with one out.  There is a fee of $10 dollars for the tournament that will cover the cost of a tee shirt and lunch at noon.  There will be a risk assumption form to be singed and turned in by the end of the week. The forms will be available in the clerk/assistants area on the 47th floor.  
 
Please bring your baseball gloves game faces and your ability to have fun.
 
Thanks,

I don't know if we need to do anything.  Seems like they are just acquiring=
 the MAIN facilities, not market design material.  Have you spoken to anyon=
e at ARTO to inquire?

Jim

Jim and Christi,

The attached document is a contract, approved by ARTO's members, covering t=
he sale of MAIN's facilities and transfer of assets to ARTO.  The document =
raises the question of whether the Alliance is violating FERC's July 12 ord=
er by making "business decisions" that should be made by an independent boa=
rd. You'll recall the language in the July 12 Order -- "We further direct t=
hat from the date of this order an independent board be established to make=
 all business decisions for the RTO."  The footnote following that statemen=
t references the Grid Florida order, in which the Commission stated: Leasin=
g office space, establishing employee benefit plans, putting accounting sys=
tems into place and other basic intrastructure tasks....clearly do not pose=
 independence concerns.  Regarding the acquisition of transmission faciliti=
es...., any agreements for such acquisitions that are entered into before t=
he independent Board is selected will be carefully scrutinized."  Thereafte=
r the Commission identified several "more problematic' steps necessary for =
implementing market design, including the acquisition of software and other=
 systems implementing market design as significant to the future operatioin=
 of the RTO, and required that any acquisition of software or other systems=
 implementing market design not be undertaken until the independent Board h=
as been seated and given approval.

To the extent the facilities conveyed to ARTO via the Asset Purchase Agreem=
ent impact market design, the transaction is problematic.  The purchased as=
sets include certain software licenses, but these may not be "market design=
"-sensitive.

Please let me know if you want the Midwest team to pursue this issue.

 << File: ARTO MAIN.doc >>

FYI.

I skimmed the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to =
take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago.  Alt=
hough I did not see the word "congestion", the implication of what I read i=
s that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion i=
mpacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is=
 that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in "b=
ut for" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too=
 high an altitude.  Did I?

I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgott=
en about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this up=
grade and "but for" stuff, and then "gives" it to the utility, are there ta=
xes due on the "gift"?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&=
E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the tax=
es on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned ov=
er to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to "waste" on=
 an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dep=
t (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes =
were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a =
private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the=
 taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS =
ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was consideri=
ng.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the=
 project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point =
of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection t=
o address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro=
cess?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process? =20

I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents t=
o the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid =
for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, "all gener=
ators are good and benefit the ratepayers.")  On fundamental grounds they w=
ill resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the ins=
ult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades)=
, they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine str=
ongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it. =
 And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine=
 within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problem=
s around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considerin=
g adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion=
.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the g=
rid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Beca=
use all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project =
in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we s=
upported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am=
 assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than=
 for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now develo=
ping in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system up=
grades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the "gift=
" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmissi=
on system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nic=
e if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of de=
aling with the tax issues in this NOPR?

Please see the attached.  FERC has asked for preliminary comments on its pr=
oposal to adopt a standard generator interconnection agreement and procedur=
es; the deadline for comments is December 21.  After it has considered the =
comments, FERC will issue a NOPR.

It will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis.  It is probably sufficient to communicate with the Credit department (under Bill Bradford) for wholesale and the EWS Services Group (under Evan Hughes) for retail.

I spoke with Evan Hughes and he is going to have CSC run a report of the tariff obligations.  He will send the info to me and I'll forward to Amr Ibrahim.

Thanks.

Rick:  
As per the discussion this morning, Risk Analytics is currently taking the first pass at our activities to determine if there is any change in the risk exposure that we ought to mitigate.  This may take several days, but perhaps the most pressing one at the moment is the impact of the change in credit rating on the normal business practices including participation in markets, and the cost of transacting in these markets (in case that a financial instrument guarantee is now needed rather than the prerequisite credit rating).  More specifically: 

1.	Credit rating concerns at the wholesale level:  Examples include guarantees of participation in different ISOs and access to transmission systems.
2.	Credit rating concerns at the retail level: Examples include licensing and registration perquisites to market power in the service territory of a distribution company.

I shall keep you posted with progress and with resulting action items.  Of course, please let me know if you have any question/advice.

Marcus N. says that everything is done on our emergency project this morning.  Sam Behrens will write an opinion letter to allow the move without the need for a 203 filing and everything else is in place.  Steve Montovano has/is confirming that in PA, OH, and NJ there are no outstanding tax or regulatory matters.

We probably want to put in place an update to Clinton's MBR that would allow for A/S trading.  Should we just have Sam do that work??

I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main Enron number) - a CPUC staffer named Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

Someone named Dan at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to Enron.  It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that "the facility isn't anywhere near the campus."

The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.  His phone number is 503-752-0873.  

I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.

The CPUC staffer is Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask Dan.  What should we do??

Power Companies Unite to Lobby State; They Want to Build Power Plants in Florida But Not Sell Directly to Consumers.

Sarasota Herald-Tribune ( November 01, 2001 )

To increase their lobbying clout, several of the nation's biggest independent power companies have formed a trade group focusing on Florida.

The group, Partnership for Affordable Competitive Energy, will try to
convince lawmakers to open Florida to companies like it that want to build
power plants but not sell the electricity directly to consumers.

Among the founding members are Calpine Corp., Competitive Power
Ventures, Constellation Power, Duke Energy North America, PG&E National Energy Group and Reliant Energy.

The announcement came a day before Gov. Jeb Bush's handpicked
research group, the Energy 2020 Study Commission, was set to discuss its findings with the Legislature and recommend opening the state to so-called merchant power plants.

Florida law prohibits companies from building power plants unless virtually
all of the electricity is for use in Florida.

Merchant power companies, however, make their money by selling power
on the wholesale market to other power suppliers.

Michael Green, Duke Energy vice president and PACE chairman, said a
deregulated Florida wholesale market will lead to lower costs for consumers and more dependable energy supplies.

Investor-owned utilities such as FPL Group and Florida Power Corp.
counter that they make plenty of energy, and prices are already among the nation's lowest.

Environmental groups worry that opening the nation to merchant plants
might set off a spree of plant-building that could damage the environment.
T
 he commission endorsed the idea of an open wholesale market last year,
but the idea buckled amid the California energy crisis and under pressure from lobbyists for FPL and Florida Power Corp.

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, 
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and 
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.

Amr --

Not for us to contact the ISOs about our Material change.

Jim

I am concerned with the credit worthiness issues with the various ISOs, and I am seeking your comments/advice on the appropriate action items that GA should take to assist the various sections in Enron to comply with the requirements in an expedient, proactive,  and cost-effective manner.    
1.	Perhaps I should start by mentioning that in NYISO, and PJM (and I assume the same for the rest), there is an obligation on the market participants for informing the ISO (some in writing, within 5 business days as the case in PJM) of any Material change in its financial condition.  The issue here should GA assist in communicating this change.   
2.	Does the Team agree that there is a need to determine exactly what are the conditions for posting a financial instrument.  How the instrument size is calculated (hence the total additional obligation)? how does it change with the change in our business volumes, or credit rating? are the terms for the financial instruments applied consistently to all market agents or just on Enron?
3.	What is the best approach to assist RAC in prioritizing which financial instrument should be dealt with first, if there is a prioritization process.  

I do have language for PJM, and NYISO if you would like to have access to them.  

I look forward for your comments and suggestions

Many thanks and Brgrds

PS:  Material change is a defined term in PJM, and includes a downgrade of a long or short term debt rating by a major rating agency; being placed on a credit watch with negative implications by a major rating agency.  

Great job!!!!

Per Jim, Enron is going to participate in EPSA's cost benefit analysis for the SE RTO.  Mirant and possibly others have said that they will perform a cost benefit analysis for the Midwest.  We are not going to participate in those.  (Please keep in mind that Enron did the "natural markets studies" for the SE and the NE).  Thanks.

ok.

I may want to take the course on November 27, Electric Business Understanding.  Sounds like it might help me to understand more about what Enron does.  Your thoughts?  This would be after the Thanksgiving holidays I believe.

Linda

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Leslie --

Did any of the gas commercial people respond?  Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?

Jim

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.  Please let me know what you would like me to do on this.  Thanks.

Great.

Jim -- my understanding is that ENA Legal is going to take care of hiring the outside counsel (Sam Behrends) on this.  I assume you still want me to open an RCR to cover our share of separate legal costs in case we join in the EPSA filing?
I am not sure which EPSA members are going to sign on.  I'll let you know as soon as I have more info.

Susan --

Please put in an RCR to discuss ASAP (probably next week).

I think that the key issue involves the inclusion of financial transactions.  Need a solid message from industry that this is inappropriate - which EPSA members are filing this info?

Jim

Today's EPSA conference call was well-attended and the participants seemed to agree that the status quo (i.e., making relatively limited paper filings of transactional information) is much preferable to the more extensive electronic posting that FERC is proposing.  Admittedly, though, some of what FERC is proposing seems to be justified -- for example, the FPA requires every public utility to show rates and charges in the form prescribed by the Commission, which gives the Commission a lot of latitude.  

The basic conclusion was that EPSA's filing should make the point that FERC should be able to find a way to meet its Section 205-c obligations in a way that is not potentially commercially damaging to market participants.  Also, FERC may be overreaching in requesting data that does not pertain to physical transactions.  Additionally, there was some discussion of requesting confidential treatment of the information to be posted.  EPSA will draft comments with the assistance of outside counsel, Dickstein Shapiro.  A draft will be circulated and if any of you are not on the EPSA distribution list I will make sure you get a copy.

Elizabeth and others, we have already discussed the importance of Enron weighing in separately in this proceeding.  Since comments are due October 5, I believe at this point it would be prudent to call our outside counsel so that we can begin the drafting process.

let's discuss at 5pm

Jim - 
	I wanted to give you an update for the first of the month.  Almost everything is updated, except for the California issues, which I assume you already have more information than I do.  I have had a difficult time getting a hold of anyone out there.  Montovano's information will be updated as soon as I get it.  If you like, we can discuss this at 5:00 when we meet.

I don't think that Govt Affairs should do anything on this (and not sure if there is anything to do).

I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?

Looks good to me.  I'll discuss with Amr to ensure his agreement.

Jim

I have several pending tasks and want to check with you if I am choosing the right priority. This is the order I am following.

1. Credit policy of different ISOs/PUCs. Requested by Amr. I am currently working on it.
2. Mexico regulations. Requested by Rick. I told Jaime Williams I would work on it this week but I could not yet. I need 2 days to study before calling him back.
3. Natural Gas Strategic Profile. Requested by Roy Boston. I was allocated Texas utilities. I did not begin to gather information yet. Deadline would be mid November.
4. Transredes Regulatory risk. Requested by Rick/Jim. I am gathering information.
5. PJM database. Begun to fill it and stopped.

Please let me know if I should follow a different priority rank. I prefer to be fired due to the stock price rather than because I did not follow the right orders.

Guille

Thanks.  Having this e-mail on the agenda for the upcoming meeting is very helpful.

Jim

FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.  The generic docket "Electricity Market Design and Structure," which is the docket FERC is using for its "RTO Week" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.  However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah 

Sue --
 
My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  
 
Thanks,

Jim

Gang,
 
Here is a current draft of AReM's comments due tomorrow.  Let me know if you have comments.  Enron will not be submitting comments separately.
 
Sue
Attached for your review and comment is a second draft of tomorrow's comments on the Wood ACR.  I have added a significantly expanded section dealing with how the Commission's inaction and subsequent action contributed to the flow of customers back and forth between DA and bundled service.  My thanks to Aaron Thomas for his assistance on this section.
 
Also, I have deleted the "CYA - not the California Youth Authority" quip --  I had to have some fun while writing this on Halloween night!

The PPO - Power Purchase Option - is a unique program based on the IL restructuring law.  Texas has no analogous service.  

I agree with your statement that we don't need an RTO, we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules.  It's important to keep consistent messages.

Jim

Jim -- Would Entergy in Texas have a PPO?  In your testimony at the Texas PUC we argued that a retail program doesn't necessarily need an RTO -- it does need the ability to go physical on a fair basis, including rational imbalance provisions of the TP OATT--not punitive.  Here we are stating that there should be a continuation of ComEd's PPO until there is a functioning wholesale market, including a good imbalance provision.  Should the argument go more toward that retail physical could work if ComED changed certain tariff provisions now, even without a PPO?  

The ICC Energy Committee held a meeting to discuss ComEd's proposal to drop the PPO.  We argued that this should not be allowed until the wholesale market/delivery issues are dealt with because otherwise customers will have no choice but to return to ComEd at the higher bundled rate.  The good news is that a rather lengthy discussion on this issue ensued as a result.  The industrial customer group and Mid American Energy supported our views; however AES New Energy said that this was not a problem for them.

We also commented that once the PPO goes away it should not be resurrected due to the uncertainty it would create in the market.  ComEd responded that under the statute they can not offer to waive the PPO but could negotiate an arrangement on the CTC if approached by the customer.  This would mean that we could negotiate on behalf of all our customers regarding the CTC.  

We have the opportunity to file comments to the Commissioners before the actual filing.  A draft is attached. 

 << File: Commissioner Terry Harvill.doc >> 

If you have any comments, please respond by the end of the week.

Thanks for our new model.  Pls let me know how it is going.

Lisa --

I appreciate your note greatly.  While we didn't always win, we did always give the other side the fight of their lives.  Electricity markets in the Mid-atlantic (and throughout the country) are better for the work you did over the last few years.  

Best of luck in your future plans.  I'm sure that we will talk again, and often.

Take care,

Jim

Jim:  

Thanks for all of your support, professionalism and friendship over the past 4 years.  I will look back on my time here with fond memories, especially our battles in Pennsylvania!!   We had some great victories, didn't we (although I learned from you that I should "declare victory no matter what the outcome")?   We had some losses, too, but defeat makes the victories sweeter.  We've all been through the good, the bad, and the ugly together.  And I'm sure that I'll never work with a more talented group of people.  

Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, and this decision has not been an easy one to make.  The only thing that makes it easier is that I know that our paths will cross again.

Give my regards to Marianna and Gracie.  I wish you all the very best.

Lisa

I agree that we are losing money.  That's not the reason for getting out of this case.  What is the upside?  Even if we win, we are only forcing FERC to reconsider at some later time.  Is this really the best strategy?

Jim

FYI.  If you are in agreement, Sarah and I will find out who to contact and see if something helpful can be worked out.  Otherwise, we will stay in the appeal. Thanks.
The source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year.   I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market.

Therefore, we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible.

Thanks.

The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).

It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts? 

Christi -

Dan has informed me that Enron's share of remaining costs in the Enron v. FERC matter will not exceed $4,000, for the work done to prepare for oral argument scheduled for November 7, 2001.

If you need a more formal document indicating this, I would be happy to send one to you.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Yes, but I think we may lose that rating.  What is the impact if that were to occur?  Seems like we should (a) identify our situation given today's environment and (b) identify the impact of one further downgrade.

Jim

Harry: 

Gloria and I agree that the situation in Texas could be currently described as "reasonable" for the time being; this taking into consideration the "Triple B" from S&P of today.  Here is the analysis.

1.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.1  purports that a deposit for a competitive retailer shall not be required provided that the retailer has not defaulted within the past 24 month.  If it defaults, then a deposit is required.  Gloria and I understand that we did not default. 
2.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.2 purports that the size of deposit is 1/6 of the estimated annual amount to be billed under the tariff.
3.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.2 purports that a form of deposit is any affiliate guaranty from an affiliate with long-term unsecured credit ratings of not less than "BBB-" or "Baa3" (or equivalent) from S&P or Moody's, respectively.  It is important to mention that other forms of security may be mutually agreed to.  

Kindly advise if you have any question.

Here are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper:

1.	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.

2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?

3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  

4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.

5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.

6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?

I probably shouldn't be so serious, but I think the current situation at Enron has made me less fun. 
 
Jim

jim, he took at the CYA footnote.  it was a joke.

Sue --
 
My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  
 
Thanks,

Jim

Gang,
 
Here is a current draft of AReM's comments due tomorrow.  Let me know if you have comments.  Enron will not be submitting comments separately.
 
Sue
Attached for your review and comment is a second draft of tomorrow's comments on the Wood ACR.  I have added a significantly expanded section dealing with how the Commission's inaction and subsequent action contributed to the flow of customers back and forth between DA and bundled service.  My thanks to Aaron Thomas for his assistance on this section.
 
Also, I have deleted the "CYA - not the California Youth Authority" quip --  I had to have some fun while writing this on Halloween night!

Yes.  I had called him to set up a meeting.  We talked recently in PA when he told me he was taking the job.  I'll arrange lunch (if everyone wants to) soon.  But don't delay talking with him.  He wants as much help from Enron as possible.

Jim

Jim:

Do you know this person?  Perhaps we could set up a meeting with him for you and John and me (I'd like to meet him too) so you can make the introductions for all of us.  I'll find out when he starts, but I know you're going to be in town over the next few weeks, so we can set something up if this works for you.

Thanks

Sarah

Jim --

I see in today's Energy Daily that the PA PUC person you mentioned when I was in Houston -- Kevin Cadden -- was officially named by Pat Wood as the director of external affairs at FERC.  You had suggested that once this happens, we should make contact with him.  Please advise if you wish to contact him first now that he is on board -- and make the introduction.  It would be good to get together with him now that the legislative side of things is heating up.  We can help them and vice versa.  Thanks.

Rick --

We do have an on-going dispute with the PAPUC about our assessment for gas sales.  The charge is $150k.  We are suing with others the PAPUC to argue that we are not a utility and therefore can't get assessed.

Jim

Trying to run down the information.

Jim

Howard --

Did we deal with the EES letter from NYISO MMU?  Pls let me know.

Jim

FYI.  Not sure if we can afford this, but if you think it's helpful let's talk.

Jim

Do we need to file on the NOPR on Partial Day Recalls??  Will EPSA file?  What position will they take?  Should we talk with Joe Hartsoe about his position?

Jim

Most of the discussion was regarding the NOPR on Allowance of Partial Day Recalls of Released Capacity. This would be a possibility only for LDCs. Comments should be submmitted around Nov 19. It was considered disruptive for the market. Discos argue they need this possibility in order to increase reliability. The problem is that the release capacity would be less attractive if distcos are given this possibility (the value of release capacity would be lower than IT). It was mentioned that this could lead to the use of daily balancing. The main fear is that State Commissions could order Discos to keep the recall right in their release.
They plan to talk to INGAA about this issue and said they would appreciate any feedback to talk to INGAA.

On other issue, it was mentioned the due date for comments about the Affiliate transaction NOPR was moved to Dec. 20.

The next conference call will be December 4 (Tuesday) at 3:30 pm.

Let me know if you did not get a 22 p. fax this afternoon.  GAC

Was the amendment approved by FERC?

Jim

Amr,
The situation with the California ISO is complicated by the fact that they recently had to face a loss of creditworthiness from PG&E and Southern California Edison. In an ammendment to the the ISO Tariff, the ISO proposed revisions to the tariff that would in effect waive the sanctions ot the ISO Tariff's creditworhiness requeriments for certain entities that were creditworthy as of January 3, 2001 but were about to lose the Approved Credit Rating that established their creditworthiness. This only applies to purchases using their own generation and transmission, but opened a pandora box in the evaluation of creditworthiness for market participants in California. In addition, the ISO Tariff did not have procedures in place to admit guarantees from third parties to back energy, ancillary services and grid management charges. A process was incorporated to this effect recently to allow SCE and PG&E buy power backed by California Department of Water Resources.
In any event, each Scheduling Coordinator (SC), Utility Distribution Company (UDC) or Metered Subsystem (MSS) must maintain an approved Credit Rating or provide in favor of the ISO one fo the following forms of security for an amount to be determined by the SC, UDC or MSS in the form stated in the Tariff:
An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit confirmed by a bank or financial institution reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional surety bond posted by an insurance company reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional guarantee which has and maintains an Approved Credit Rating;
A cash deposit standing to the credit fo an interested bearing escrow accoint maintained at a bank or financial institution designated by the ISO;
A certificate of deposit in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO; or
A payment bond certificate in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO;
Letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, payment bond certificates, escrow agreements and certificates of deposit shall be in such form as the ISO may reasonably require from time to time by notice to SC, UDCs or MSSs. SCs, UDCs or MSSs that do not maintain an approved credit rating will not be allowed to submit a schedule to the ISO, and the ISO will reject any schedule submitted if the security amount is not deposited. If an outstanding liability exceeds 90% of the required security amount, a notification by the ISO will be issued to cover the security within 15 days.
As of March 13, 2000, an approved credit rating with respect to market obligations, is defined as an entity maintaining at lest an A2/P2 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating or a A3/A- (or equivalent) long-term credit rating from a national credit rating agency. Market obligations are Imbalance energy, Ancillary Services, Grid Operations Charge, Wheeling Access Charge, High Voltage Access Charge, Transition Charge, Usage Charges and FERC Annual Charges. I suppose day-ahead energy charges are also included since the dissolution of the PX, although I could not find an explicit reference to this issue in the regulations.
SCs, UDCs or MSSs  must maintain A1/P1 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating for the Grid Management charges, or the charges the ISO makes to fund its operations.
If you have any questions, please let me know. Regards,
ALF

FYI.  Will you attend the meeting at FERC?

Jim

To prepare for Wednesday's meeting at FERC on interconnection, we will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 6th at 11:00 a.m. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA conference call.  The topics for discussion on Wednesday and Thursday will be the scope of interconnection rights, the scope of studies associated with interconnections and the rights associated with those studies.  Please forward any really good language on these issues to Julie Simon at EPSA at jsimon@epsa.org.

Jim,  I contacted Doug Nichols of PGE on this, and the matter has to do with "Edison Bailout" bill (SBXX78).  Sue Mara is aware of this bill and a recent e-mail from her indicates that the bill was scheduled to be voted on yesterday and that it would suspend direct access as of 8/25.  I expect that Sue will report on the outcome of yesterday's vote.  In any event, Howard Weg, who represents PGE in the PX and PG&E bankruptcies, was asking if PGE was interested in supporting the legislation, but PGE declined to do so.  So... that's where the matter stands- it appears to be a moot issue.  Ray

Ray --

I think that this is about the CalPX bankruptcy.  Any issues?  Can you please get with PGE to make sure we are on the same page?

Jim

By the way, who is Al referring to when he sais Doug is working with "Enron Central" and who has he contacted re:  "Enron guidance."  Sheesh.  

see additional note from Doug Nichols.

This is the latest status on Howard's effort - PGE is included in the "in favor" group in Howard's message - but both Al and I have since let him know he should not include us as being "in favor" unless and until we've coordinated this with Enron - I'm relying on you to do that.  Time is very short - Howard needs to be moving on this now if he has any shot at all of influencing the outcome.  While I agree the message ought to be delivered, I'm not optimistic there is time for the legislature to do anything else at this point.  If nothing else, it would be good let the decision makers know that their plan may not have the hoped for result, so they can't say no one told them.  dn
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the 1 billion shortage to sellers.  We're still trying to get Enron guidance on this.  Possibly we'd rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution.  I'm traveling with my  cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central.  Please stand by in terms of adding our name to the agressive list. Sorry for the mixed signals.  al

>>> "Howard J. Weg" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 08/28/01 09:35PM >>>
I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding
my email dated August 27, 2001 with respect to the proposal to contact the
Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE.

Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have
suggested that the message is too strong.  Our Ex Officio members BPA and
WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with
addressing the state government on this or other issues.  As you know, I
want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is
possible, and to protect the interests of all members.

Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against
SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for
bankruptcy or litigation.  After all, the Unofficial Committee was organized
to provide a different approach generally.  The purpose of contacting the
Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they
are now considering, which leaves SCE about $1 billion short on the proposed
financing to pay creditors, may cause some other sellers to take precipitous
action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or
arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower $2.9
billion level, which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally.
We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action
will be taken. The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is
not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether, only legislation
that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE.

The tone of the presentation, if we make one, will be low key, non
threatening, and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor
design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy, litigation and other
alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed,
leaving the energy sellers out in the cold.

If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be
associated with the message outlined above, then I propose that we give such
members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and
allowing us, if asked, to identify any such members that prefer not to be a
part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids
litigation and bankruptcy for SCE.  I understand that the LADWP and Coral
Power would like this approach adopted.

As I explained in my prior email, it has been suggested that the proposed
bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor
Day and before the Sept 14 adjournment.  That is why timing is important.
Those of you that have not responed, please respond.  Those of you that were
concerned that the message was unclear, please review this email and
consider or reconsider your positions, as the case may be.

As of right now, there are only 11 votes: 9 in favor and 2 against.  The
polls are still open so please let me know your position.

You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined
that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee
required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee.

[Steffes, James D.]  
[Steffes, James D.]   Thank you for the offer, but at this time we will not be participating.  Jim Steffes

PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT: THE CAEM GRID ENHANCEMENT FORUM
 
PROMPT REPLY REQUESTED.
 
A slew of new power control, management, transmission and storage technologies are becoming available in the power marketplace to reduce congestion, enhance performance and improve reliability.  These technologies carry great promise for addressing some of the challenges currently faced by regulators and market participants alike.  But there appear to be significant institutional, regulatory and pricing barriers to their widespread use.  In addition, the new technologies are likely to present challenges of their own.
 
Accordingly, the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM-www.caem.org) is hosting a consensus-building forum designed to (a) achieve a common understanding of the grid-enhancing potential of the new technologies; (b) use an intensive role-reversal seminar to identify and highlight the institutional, regulatory and market design barriers to the successful deployment of the various new tools; and (c) develop technology-neutral recommendations addressing these barriers.
 
The project will begin in early 2002 with final policy recommendations to be published by Spring of 2002.  The project is expected to have a significant impact on decisions made by regulators, financial analysts, utility executives, the media and potential customers.
 
For a copy of the proposal, please e-mail Philip Marston, the Project Director, at pmarston@marstonlaw.com.  This forum is time-sensitive and the number of participants is limited.

Fine.  Why not have this as the first element of EISB Wholesale Quadrant??

Jim

Gentlemen,
 
At the ESC meeting last week, some discussion was brought forth about the voting model and bylaws of the ESC.  I joined a small task group to investigate various structures and such.
 
I have attached a strawman set of Bylaws for the ESC that I have written.  I would like to get your input on these items as soon as possible.  The small focus group will be working to determine an appropriate model, and will be using the NERC 8-sector model as its starting point.  I would like to propose this 5-sector model instead, as I think it more closely aligns with the way business works and builds the approriate motivational structure.  There may need to be more detail in the sector definitions, as right now they are somewhat loose.
 
Thanks in advance for your comments.
 

Andy

Ray --

Have you looked at the testimony?  It appears to be hitting the key points.  Is there anything else that we need to be doing to make sure that our case is as strong as possible?

Give me a call.

Jim

Not sure.  Probably won't be ready until end of year.
 
Jim

Christi, Any idea on how long it will take to complete ?   Dan

Per Jim, Enron is going to participate in EPSA's cost benefit analysis for the SE RTO.  Mirant and possibly others have said that they will perform a cost benefit analysis for the Midwest.  We are not going to participate in those.  (Please keep in mind that Enron did the "natural markets studies" for the SE and the NE).  Thanks.

Attached is a summary of the SCE meeting to discuss our Negative CTC claim.  Call if you would like any additional information.

Jim
?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Marchris --

Pls provide John with any further information.

Jim

It would be helpful to get a further report from Marchris.  Tauzin is likely to send an anti-RTO letter to FERC soon based on the letter from the LA PSC and from lobbying by Entergy, with whom he is very close since they are  based in New Orleans and have been his biggest and longest supporters.  Apparently, Entergy asked him for legislation to block FERC but he has said no electricity legislation will be taken up this year.  Tauzin's folks are saying a letter of some kind is a fallback that is designed to  be responsive to LA PSC and Entergy without hurting us as much as legislation.

John

John -- I read an Oct. 8 letter to Billy Tauzin from the LA PSC: basically against transcos, federal siting authority, enhanced ROR, roll-in of transmission costs (due to IPPs that sell power out of the state, since there is a significant amount of IPP gen going into Entergy).  Marchris met with the LA PSC, but I have not heard that they have changed their position.  Is there anything else you need us to do?

If we do take over this type of role, what issues and information would the NYISO be entitled to?  We are pushing DG and load curtailment very actively.  

Jim

Yes. We informed the ISO in late September, I believe, that EES had not been involved in any of the enumerated types of activities they asked about. Paul Darmitzel was the EES lawyer who worked on the matter.

Howard --

Did we deal with the EES letter from NYISO MMU?  Pls let me know.

Jim

Melinda --

Let's talk soon.  I want to make sure that you understand all of the implications of this decision.

Jim

I received an offer this past Friday for a position with EES very unexpectantly.  I've accepted the position this morning .  The group would like me start immediately but I know I need to get with Becky on a few things and finish out a project I've been working on.  

Do you guys have a time frame in mind?  I'm thinking my last day could be the 15th of November.

Melinda

Alberto --

Pls ask Sue Mara where these stand.  I thought that the FERC didn't approve.

Jim

Jim,
I presume that both filings, the one on third party guarantees, and the one on lower credit ratings, were approved by FERC. Both were approved by the Board and both are in the ISO Tariff, the first is ammendment 36 and the second ammendment 29. I could not find the actual FERC order in the millions of hits in the very imperfect search engine of the CAISO. Please advise. Regards,

Andy is looking for about $1500 for tuition reimbursement.  I would, if we can afford it, pay this.  I indicated that going forward we could not make any committments but finishing his college would be helpful.

Thoughts?

Jim

Jim,
Here is his letter.  I have also attached a breakdown of how that grade was determined.

Andy, 
Congratulations, you have received an A. 
A great last week with your usual high level of enthusiasm and professional work outputs. Your paper was very compelling too - the graphic really helped to get the point across. What made this paper even better was the way you integrated it into your work life at Enron. 
The group presentation was outstanding - it was nicely laid out with good balance and structure and covered all the relevant points. It showed a high level of design and thought and it provided a concise view of the teams strengths and weaknesses and how the combinations of them helped it to be effective. It was a professional product and by far one of the best presentations I have seen on this subject. 
Best of luck in all of your future endeavors and I wish you continued success in all of your professional aspirations.

Sounds good.  Maybe we can employ the Gov one last time before the end of the year to try and message a "workable" solution --  let's just decide what that is (maybe some bare minimums on RTOs)?

Jim

Jim,

Just to let you know, Ray and I spoke with Marc Racicot today about WestConnect and the problems associated with the filing made on Ocotber 15.

We emphasized the problems with overall lack of independence, lack of resolution on congestion management and market monitoring despite a four year process to do so.  We also touched on significant participating transmission operator involvement in the planning and interconnection process as well.

Mr. Racicot seemed very appreciative of our comments and noted that many of the governors he speaks with still do not have a full understanding of the implications of forming an RTO and will typically follow the path of least resistance.  Having been made aware of our concerns will help him better craft his message to this group.  He is interested in receiving any bullet points or summaries of any filing we make in regards to WestConnect.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Look at this web site  www.southerncompany.com  Go to the section "NEWS & ISSUES" section of the web site.  They compute the cost of moving an electron from New Orleans to NYC.

Jim

Rick --

Are you going to put out the new org chart by this Friday?

Jim

Howard --

How did this mistake happen?  Does their tariff allow for restatement of prices?  Does this cost the desk $$?  Maybe the NYISO shouldn't be doing this?

Jim

FYI.
An error has been found in the computation of the market-clearing price
established
for the November Deficiency Auction for UCAP purchased and sold in the New
York
City Locality.

The NYISO has corrected the error and posted the revised results of the
auction
to its web-site.  Correcting the computational error revised the New York
City Locality
market-clearing price of UCAP for the month of November from $4.35/kW-month
to
$4.80/kW-month.

Revised Award Notices will be sent to purchases and sellers of UCAP based
on
these revised results.

For your convenience, the revised auction results are attached.

"HOW ENRON BLEW IT"
Enron's Cutthroat Culture (on the cover)

For Houston's sake as the Energy Capital, we hope the best for Enron as it
turns this thing around.

INTRO EXCERPT
The Houston-based energy giant put the pursuit of profits ahead of all other
corporate goals, which fostered a climate of workaholism and paranoia.  And
that was only part of the problem.  (from the table of contents).

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything:
money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the
most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, Wall Street is
bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

This is so-o-o blatant.

Should we take this up with Bob Pease, or since it was inadequate to begin with, just forget it?

I'd say $395 is fair.

Jim -- I know--I have seen this and it is very tempting.  It's expensive, but it could be very valuable from a time-saving standpoint.  I have spent many hours researching "the latest from FERC" (as they like to put it) for our developers.  These are some of the more time-consuming issues I have to research, for some reason.  Maybe I could talk EEI into a discount...what do you think might be reasonable?

Thanks, Jim. If you conclude that you think this is promising, I'd suggest
you talk to some of our current sponsors to see if we're for real. The
corporate types like ATT or the Manufacturers Association would be the best
fit, but you can talk to anybody you want to. I also understand how unusual

   We produce political/public affairs television programs which air in
   state capitols. Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio, expanding
   into NJ, Md and DE. The disruptive technology is this: the real target
   of the TV show is the guest, not the audience. Lobbyists have trouble
   scheduling time with politicians and regulators, and when they get on
   the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from
   government decision makers. We don't have trouble with either. Every
   politician and appointee wants to be on television, they always say yes.
   When they ask us what the topics will be, and we mention something like
   telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want
   briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on
   television. In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television
   commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them.

   In short:

   Step one: identify gov't decision makers that our sponsors want to
   influence
   Step two: invite them on the program and, in doing so, develop rapport
   with their key staff members on the relevant issues
   Step three: send briefing materials and/or give a briefing in person
   before the the taping
   Step four: towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely
   been bragging about his/her policy agenda
   Step five: steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics, framing
   the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to
   resist the conclusions suggested by the host.
   Step six: take the statement of support for the position we favor e.g.
   tort reform, privatization, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. (which by the
   way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air) and in
   addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show, we
   digitize it and send it out to legislators, regulators and the proper
   beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker
   to back off later.

   Current sponsors: Medical Society, Hospital Association, State System of
   Higher Education, Manufacturers Association, Cornell Corrections, AT&T.
   Levels: 25K, 50K, 100K per year for Pa; 15k for Ohio (one level only).

   This is an amazingly simple, elegant and direct way to influence policy
   makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energy-oriented firms
   in partnership with us. Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit.

   I'll be in touch,

   p.s. Sponsorship can be done in ways that are not visible if you prefer,
   via intermediaries, if you are publicity shy.

I would recommend that either Steve or myself call Bittenbender to recommend Kirk House - we met with him on the RTO discussions.

Jim

We should do it..you all figure out who is best person is. Thanks.

I received a call from Dan Clearfield this morn.  Nora Mead-Brownell has asked for his assistance in getting marketers to call the governor's office in support of Kirk House who is a former aide and is seeking the position of Small Business Advocate.  Mr. House is a supporter of competition and would be helpful in that position.  Apparently, the electric companies are opposing him. I would recommend that we make the call and I would be happy to do so, however, there are others who may have better contacts than I do (such as Sue in her work with the Governors),  Please advise.

Janine  

Here is the name and number of the person in the Gov's office that deals with utility issues:  Fritz Bittenbender,783-2896.  The appointment is made by the Gov. (Schweiker).  He has two top aides:  Mark Campbell and Dave Sanko.  I can get you current phone #s for the latter people if you wish them.   Thanks for whatever help Enron can be.

We are good for continuation of the Andy 50-50 with Lloyd.  Lloyd said that we do not need to do anything and his payment will continue.  

We are pulling this together and will talk with Marcus Nettleson as appropriate.

Jim

Is there anything that the wholesale group needs to be doing for this?  I have not heard back from Ed Sacks or Elizabeth.  Thanks.

I am concerned with the credit worthiness issues with the various ISOs, and I am seeking your comments/advice on the appropriate action items that GA should take to assist the various sections in Enron to comply with the requirements in an expedient, proactive,  and cost-effective manner.    
1.	Perhaps I should start by mentioning that in NYISO, and PJM (and I assume the same for the rest), there is an obligation on the market participants for informing the ISO (some in writing, within 5 business days as the case in PJM) of any Material change in its financial condition.  The issue here should GA assist in communicating this change.   
2.	Does the Team agree that there is a need to determine exactly what are the conditions for posting a financial instrument.  How the instrument size is calculated (hence the total additional obligation)? how does it change with the change in our business volumes, or credit rating? are the terms for the financial instruments applied consistently to all market agents or just on Enron?
3.	What is the best approach to assist RAC in prioritizing which financial instrument should be dealt with first, if there is a prioritization process.  

I do have language for PJM, and NYISO if you would like to have access to them.  

I look forward for your comments and suggestions

Many thanks and Brgrds

PS:  Material change is a defined term in PJM, and includes a downgrade of a long or short term debt rating by a major rating agency; being placed on a credit watch with negative implications by a major rating agency.  

I still think that Enron should be advocating some form of Negawatt program=
 for non-retail access states.  Using an RTP tariff that more closely track=
s the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational =
signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load respons=
e needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a =
DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.

By the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.  We shou=
ld make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week.

Jim

Please see Dave's comments below -- it's helpful for me for everyone to kno=
w what everyone else is saying.

Sarah

I have added my 2 cents below in BOLD, I hope this helps....or at least fol=
lows our general thoughts!

 The FERC Staff report on RTO Week states that most panelists agree that so=
me type of long term capacity obligation is needed, as long as demand is no=
t very price responsive, in order to allow generation to recover its fixed =
costs and support investment. =20

The report also notes that some panelists support: =20

=09-=09a recent staff proposal supporting an LSE holding foward call option=
s on energy YES, and=20

=09-=09a capacity obligation being a transitional obligation until demand b=
ecome price responsive.  As I describe below I believe that placing the res=
ponsibility on the LSE should be sufficient, I don't think you need a trans=
istional period.

I have cut and pasted our Executive Summary from the ICAP comments as our r=
esponse (see below), but I have a couple of questions for this group:

=091.=09We say in our comments that a real time energy market, through an R=
TO, will give consumers the means to adjust their demand curve because they=
 will see real time prices.  However, if a state has a rate freeze in effec=
t and/or if retail access is not permitted in a state, how can retail load =
respond to the RTO's real time spot market prices? The short answer would b=
e, they won't.  But we need to remember that some states still are moving f=
orward with some type of retail access, mostly for the C&I customer market.=
  These are the folks who can make a difference and the ones with the most =
potential to benefit.  In the areas of no retail access it is still importa=
nt to have a transparent market to send the correct signals for development=
 of transmission and generation, but even without retail access and a fixed=
 rate, depending upon new technologies and innovations some larger C&I cust=
omers may opt to build their own in-house source of energy and sell off any=
 excess, without market signals this would not be possible.  We need to inc=
lude this response in our comments.

=092.=09What do we think of a proposal where LSEs hold forward call options=
 on energy as a way to achieve a capacity requirement?  This is the proposa=
l I believe we should support because it places the procurement for suffici=
ent resources where it belongs, on the LSE.  The generators will still be a=
ble to receive a "capacity" payment (the one they like so much now from the=
 ISOs in PJM and NY)

Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.  Also, any thoughts you have on othe=
r parts of the Staff report would be greatly appreciated (thanks Dave Perin=
o for sending you comments).

Thanks Everyone

Sarah

EPMI opposes the continuation or implementation of installed capacity requi=
rements.  Four appropriately sized Regional Transmission Organizations ("RT=
Os") that encompass robust, competitive spot markets for energy and operati=
ng reserve products (including demand side management products) will provid=
e an efficient and timely solution for the construction of adequate generat=
ion, the siting of appropriate transmission and efficient use of demand sid=
e management products to ensure that demand is met in real time.  Spot mark=
ets reveal the cost of procuring  (or not using) electricity based on actua=
l supply and demand conditions and, thus, signal the need for new generatio=
n capacity.  They also ensure that consumers 'see' the cost of procurement =
decisions through transparent spot market processes and adjust demand based=
 on discovered prices.  These markets will keep supply and demand in balanc=
e in both the long and short run without the use of artificial planning cri=
teria.  Therefore, there is no need to continue separate installed capacity=
 requirements in an RTO environment.
The use of the spot market to establish pricing for all energy products is =
new to the electricity industry.  Regulated consumers have historically pai=
d utility tariffs that reflect regulatory decisions.  These regulated tarif=
fs provide little, if any, meaningful supply/demand price information to th=
e consumer so the response has been to consume even during times when the u=
nderlying "cost" of doing so has been high.  As a result, demand curves hav=
e been categorized as 'inelastic' or 'vertical' suggesting the need for 'ca=
pacity' related products to meet any unexpected price insensitive demand.  =
The creation of RTOs and the resulting spot markets they include will, for =
the first time, give consumers the means and incentive to change the shape =
of their demand curve as a result of direct real time pricing information. =
 Changes in the shape of the demand curve will in turn eliminate the need f=
or specific capacity related payments as supply/demand interaction, and cur=
tailment, will be based on economic choices.

Great news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  

On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??

Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?

Jim

Linda Robertson and I had lunch with Gail McDonald, Maryland PSC commissioner, yesterday in Baltimore.  Linda knows Gail and her husband (it's an old Oklahoma thing), so Linda arranged the lunch for us.

On the RTO front, Gail told us that the MD PSC is not opposed to one Northeast RTO.  They see it as inevitable but they do have concerns about the "contamination" problem (i.e., PJM is a good, functioning ISO, New York is not, and Maryland does not want PJM to be contaminated by New York).  They were particularly troubled by FERC's statements that "best practices" from New York and New England should be included in the new Northeast RTO.

I told Gail that we are very aligned with their position.  I said we believe PJM is the best market in the U.S. and the ISO is a sound, independent organization.  I said our traders like the liquidity of the western hub, and our goal has been to spread PJM throughout the rest of the Northeast.  I told her that we too are concerned about contamination from New York, which is why we worked so hard to endorse a plan that put PJM firmly in control of the development of the new RTO market design and of the new RTO.  We discussed how New York and New England are opposed to weighting the board towards PJM, but that we believe (and presumably Maryland would support this position) that the new board must be weighted by PJM board members to ensure proper implementation of the PJM model.  At a minimum, PJM must be in charge of implementing the new market design.

Gail also said the MD PSC thought the seams process should be worked out before a single RTO is in place.  I explained to her the problems of the MOU and that we (and most market participants) do not believe that the three ISOs will ever be able to work out the seams issues as long as they remain separate entities.  She was not familiar with the MOU process but seemed to agree that if the seams were not resolved by the entities over the last two years, that it is unlikely that they will ever been resolved.

Gail is going to NARUC next week (she's on the gas committee, which Nora asked her to be on earlier this year), and we urged Gail to find Nora and discuss these issues in more detail.  We told Gail that Nora (coming from the Pennsylvania PSC) understands and agrees with the concerns raised by Gail, but that Nora seems to believe that the way to fix the problem is to implement PJM throughout the Northeast.

Gail also asked about the State/FERC initiative and asked what happened with the Regional Reliability Organization concept.  I told her I will look in to it and get back to her.

As we were finishing lunch, Gail said our discussion was very helpful for her to better understand the issues surrounding a Northeast RTO.  She also said she will try and "turn down the rhetoric" from the PSC.  Linda and I again encouraged Gail to talk with Nora next week, and we said we hoped that we (Enron) could work together with the PSC to ensure that the right RTO is implemented in the Northeast.

Linda and I were quite pleased with the lunch and are hopeful that we can get something going with Maryland.  Ending Maryland's opposition to a Northeast RTO would be extremely helpful in the political debate that seems to be taking place.

Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

I am beginning to agree with Dave on Governance - that a for-profit TransCo may not be in our best interest.  Let's talk about how to change the wording.
 
Jim

Janel,
 
The paper is OK.
 
My only comments would be, as far as an RTO offer non-discriminatory access to transmission, I think without the word "comparable" the Participating Transmission Owners (PTOs) of the proposed westConnect would say, yes, they offer non-discriminatory access...to whatever is left over after they distribute the majority of the rights to the incumbants!  Is that comparable, in my opinion no, which is one of the reasons why I inserted the word comparable.  I can see where that may be nit-picking, but that was my reason for adding it.
 
As far as my comment about Governance.  The governance of WestConnect, a for-profit TransCo, is severely biased to the favor of the PTOs.  Perhaps it is just their version of a for-profit Transco that is not favorable to other market-participants, but I would be cautious in citing a for-profit RTO as a preferred model, a for-profit Transco operating within a non-profit - Independent RTO, seems to be a more reasonable.  But these judgements are based on my understanding of the WestConnect.
 
Kind Regards,
 
Dave 

Jim, Dave and Steve - 
 
Thank you very much for the feedback and edits to the Well-Designed RTO paper.  I've made the bulk of the changes you suggested except for the section on page 1 - Which constitutes a well-designed institutional structure for an RTO?
 
Each of you had significant issues with this section.  I get the feeling that we should eliminate it altogether but want to clear that with you before I do so.  Do you have alternative suggestions?  
 
Other than that particular section, I would really appreciate if you reviewed the attached one more time (with the changes that were made) and let me know if you are comfortable with how it is evolving.
 
thank you.

Joe Hartsoe (Fed Reg Affairs) got cc: on the demand letter from PJM.  I assume you have the letter.  If not, please let me know - Joe sent me a copy.

Jim

Ok.  But let's keep the time and $ minimal.

Jim

Sarah and I discussed this.  It seems that there is not much downside to remaining in the case with VEPCO ($4000).  We have known that a win at the DC Circuit means that FERC will reconsider, but now we have a new FERC.  A loss keeps us in the same position we are in now.  A win at the DC Circuit and, subsequently with FERC, would possibly mean some upside for Enron -- even if for one year pre-new RTOs (per Kevin $10-15 MM).  There is also something positive about being on the same side as a utility against another utility.
We should approach VEPCO about talking with some FERC people about possibly settlement:  it may lead to something positive and can allow us to discuss our RTO agenda and why RTOs (with our congestion management) solves this.  Thus, we think there is upside to continuing.  Let us know!  Thanks.

I agree that we are losing money.  That's not the reason for getting out of this case.  What is the upside?  Even if we win, we are only forcing FERC to reconsider at some later time.  Is this really the best strategy?

Jim

FYI.  If you are in agreement, Sarah and I will find out who to contact and see if something helpful can be worked out.  Otherwise, we will stay in the appeal. Thanks.
The source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year.   I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market.

Therefore, we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible.

Thanks.

The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).

It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts? 

Christi -

Dan has informed me that Enron's share of remaining costs in the Enron v. FERC matter will not exceed $4,000, for the work done to prepare for oral argument scheduled for November 7, 2001.

If you need a more formal document indicating this, I would be happy to send one to you.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

FERC will be the ultimate decider on Admin Cost Adder, not the IURC.  Not s=

I have calls into a number of intervenors to get their take on this and wil=

Yes

Jim - I was just wondering if I could delete all of Jeff Brown's old RCRs.

We need to ensure that the EDI rules are final and allow Enron to switch billing options early next year (see #2 below).  Let me know if there are any issues.

Jim

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

I was told Bradford would, "release the $1 million tomorrow."  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

FYI. What form of security did we post the $1million? How does this amount change over time? Why do you think Con-Ed's consumption estimates are so different than ours?
Jeff -

Excellent analysis - thanks.

RH
Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		1,395						1,395
Peak Month MWh	8,993						5,694
Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Gloria,
As requested.  The method by which the $1 million security requirement for
agency billing on Enron Energy Services' current population is explained
below.  This is a consistent approach at calculating security requirements
for agency billing for ESCOs participating in our service territory.  If you
have questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Are they going to send a new invoice with changed amounts??  Do they know not to do anything going forward?

Jim

Jim,

I apologize for taking so long to get back to you on this.

As I said during our call last week, I have not ever seen an invoice before.  As I recal from this summer, Stokes kept me posted on the fiscal/tax crisis in TN but I did not ask them to do so explicitly.  As I understood it, I was one of a number of clients they were keeping posted.  They were well aware that we no longer owned the 2 plants and thus were no longer taxpayers.  The work that I requested in covering the Energy Working Group meetings during the late summer and fall.  Also, they represent Tenaska and possibly Calpine and Allegheny and should be splitting those expenses among us.

Also, we should have a talking point response to the NARUC points (would be good to come from EPSA).

Jim

Jim,

Sue Landwehr, Roy Boston, and Tom Hoatson are attending the NARUC meetings.  Sue/Roy/Tom -- who can attend?

Sue & Kerry -

Do you know if anyone is going to this?  Should we work with EPSA to publish an EPSA piece that corresponds to this?

After the PHC today, we should have a better feel where the parties are and what the discussions will provide for.  Sue, can you make sure that Jeremy and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps.

Thanks.

thanks.  this is really important to the restructures we are working on.

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA "contract".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

Sue

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

FYI.

PG&E also mentioned it.  Here is the excerpt from its commnets on the Wood ACR filed 11/2/01.

1.	What effect, if any, should be given to renewals of contracts originally entered into prior to the effective date of the Commission's suspension of direct access?

An appropriate charge on direct access customers obviates the need to regulate renewals of direct access contracts entered into on or before September 20, 2001.  Absent the charge, the Commission would need to address what kind of renewals should be covered by any potential prohibition against renewals.  Prohibited renewals could include (1) renewal of contracts whose terms expire without any provisions for extension; and (2) renegotiation within the contract term of any material term or condition of the contract, including price.  The Commission would also need to consider whether an interim prohibition on renewals is needed to stop renegotiations or renewals that are very likely underway already, pending final Commission action.   

thanks.  this is really important to the restructures we are working on.

Jim

Jim-

We are working very hard to have an operational and reliable EDI environment in New York. So far, we are covering the three main billing scenarios (UDC-bill ready, UDC-rate ready and ESCO-bill ready) that we may choose and switch as needed. EDI billing is not ready yet but we expect having it implemented (testing included) at the most by May 2002. I'll keep you posted on the latest developments. Let me know if you need any questions. Thanks, Vinio

Let's discuss this afternoon.

Jim

I just talked with Kenneth Kohut and Bob Zarik of FERC (with Scott Miller's group).  They want to track Enron's EnronOnline pricing for these PHYSICAL products:

Gas
-Transco Zone 6 NY
-Henry Hub
-Chicago City Gate 
-Malin
-El Paso Non-bondad
-Permian Basin

Power
-Palo Verde 
-COB
-Mid C
-Cinergy
-PJM West

They would like us to tell them the best physical product to follow in gas (ie, gas daily, etc.) and want something that has Dec 01 pricing.  They also want EnronOnline end of day bid prices historically since August 01.  They then want to follow the pricing on EnronOnline themselves.

They already have access to most of this data through EnronOnline; however, the EnronOnline help desk told them that EnronOnline itself does not have historical data.  

I'll check with gas guys and see if we can get the data and report back to you.

http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/newsarticle.asp?siteid=mktw&sid=1803&guid=%7B3A6675C1%2DBE6A%2D4AB5%2DB63A%2D29DAB6E99295%7D

Rick called Lynne Church to discuss maybe having EPSA put out daily "papers" on market issues.  EPSA did this at the FERC RTO Week and it worked very well.

Jim

Jim -- I'll call Samantha Slater to see if she has already begun drafting a talking-point paper.  It seems a natural adjunct to the "lively debate" she envisions in Philadelphia during the NARUC meeting.

Also, we should have a talking point response to the NARUC points (would be good to come from EPSA).

John --

Thanks for the update.  As long as the FERC is fully in control and the ERO is not a "self-regulating" organization, I assume we'd be ok.  The ERO must be fully under the control of FERC.

Jim

EPSA had wanted comments by Noon today on the House staff draft on reliability (hence I have copied them on this e-mail).  There has been e-mail traffic between and among many if not all of us as we have looked at this langauge and as Charles and I have had various conversations with EPSA staff.  Below are some comments and some issue spotting to get your reaction as we continue to evaluate this important subject.

1.	The House staff draft (supposedly based on informal Administration language) does appear to be an improvement over the NERC language -- the extent to which it is so is open to interpretation and judgment.  While it is shorter and does NOT have the regional entities and variances in the NERC language, the basis of the House staff draft is still an ERO.  I thought we did not want an ERO of any kind, particularly one created by statute.  On the other hand, some argue an ERO of some type is inevitable and task should be to give FERC as much control over it as obtainable.  Furthermore, the House staff draft appears to make approving an ERO discretionary with FERC (the text says FERC "may" certify an applicant to be the ERO).

2.	Given that the House staff draft is an improvement -- and it is a welcome development that it is NOT the NERC language -- it would be a major tactical victory to have both the Senate and the House mark up vehicles WITHOUT the NERC "consensus text."  Since EPSA is the group most likely to NOT want NERC at this point, I appreciate the tactical need not to dump on the House staff draft to the point where the House staff says, well, if you don't like, we should go back to the NERC version since there is a group that  DOES support that version.  So we have to keep that in mind.  In short, we need to "nurture" the House staff draft for House markup purposes while keeping our options open to support the Bingaman language in the Senate and perhaps in conference, too.

3.	EPSA may be able to seek further improvements to the House staff draft.  As written, it gives FERC more jurisdiction than the NERC version, and less procedural hurdles -- but there are still some procedural hurdles, although one can argue of far less consequence than the NERC version.  Bingaman gives FERC more direct reliability jurisdiction than the House staff draft.  Specific issues are identified below.

4.	Specific Issues Spotted In House Staff Draft --

	a.	There is no definition of "reliability" and thus it is unclear what matters are within the jurisdiction of the ERO on which to develop standards and enforce them.  Perhaps there needs to be a sentence that says FERC can assign specific matters to them or otherwise define the EROs turf.  Would FERC have that ability without specific language?  Another option is to use the definition of "organization standard" in the NERC version which makes it clear that the subject matter is technical standards --  not a broader agenda under the guise of "reliability."

	b.	Unless I am mistaken, the House staff draft would allow FERC to certifiy more than one ERO.  This would be an odd result; by contrast, the NERC version makes it clear that if more than one entity applies, FERC picks one to be THE ERO (but then requires that single ERO to defer to regional reliability entities -- there is no such deference under the House staff draft).  On the other hand, if FERC can approve multiple EROs -- would this result in regional EROs? (perhaps one in the East and one in the West?)

	c.	There is an internal conflict in the House staff draft.  Part of it says FERC could assign the enforcement role of an ERO in a given region to an RTO.  But from the NERC-led discussions, PJM and others have pointed out the criteria for an ERO has "independence" language and other organizational criteria that an RTO could not meet (i.e., the ERO must be independent of users and owners and operators of the bulk power system under the House staff language).

	d.	Why does there need to be language saying proposed reliability rules go into effect after so many days if FERC does not act?  Like the NERC version, the House staff draft precludes FERC from directly amending standards (although there is language that says FERC can order the ERO to propose a standard, as there is in the NERC version.  Some say this should not be objectionable because as a practical matter this is the manner for FERC to amend proposed standards without offending Canada and Mexico.  Others see it as a needless hurdle. (The House draft has direct FERC amending authority on the rules by which the ERO operates -- but NOT on the reliability standards themselves.) 

I didn't say that was ok.  She was to move on Nov 15.

Jim

I understand that you have talked to Melinda about her leaving to go to EES.  Did you and she agree that she could go down and work with them part of the day until she is officially transferred?  She has spent about 3 hours down there so far today and was gone about the same yesterday.  

I didn't want to say anything to her if you had already told her it was okay.  

Help as much as you need to.

Jim

FYI

Great news!  I am involved in the sale of the South American assets, so I look forward to working with you.

Rick

Rick

Our department has revised internal priorities for the short and medium term.

Selling some of our non-strategic assets is on the top of the list.

Therefore, if you are still involved on this, you can count on me - now on a " formal basis"

LM

Harry, Janine, & Bob --

Joe Short works on Project Phoenix (rebooking of old EES deals).  He is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the Simon Properties deal with the Master Meter issue.  

If anyone has any old files on this, please send his way.  Also, any updates on where we stand (e.g., Ohio court cases) would be good.  

We probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal.  After we get Joe our info, we can regroup to determine next steps.

Thanks.  If anyone has any questions, please call.

Jim

Joe --

I forwarded the call from Phil to Bill Bradford and let Kevin Presto know.  If you hear anything else, pls let me know.

Jim

Thanks.  I don't think that I want to travel to Europe right now.  Market opportunities are slowing down.  

I think that we'll go to Mom's for some time.  You can always come over through the weekend to see Gracie.

Thanks.

I spoke with Fritz  regarding Kirk House, he confirmed negative push back from "several" parties.  I explained our support for Kirk as it fits the administrations goals on competition etc. He told me to concentrate on the senate which is where the opposition was building its case against Kirk.  He also told me that he would not be sending any names to the seante for awhile until they confirmed next PSC commisioner, probably in Nov.  Clearfield tells me that AT&T is strongly supporting Kirk both at the Gov office as well as the Senate.  I asked Dan to get our support known for Kirk in the Senate, however if AT&T can't get it done I doubt we will have that much of an impact.  We will pursue however to the extent resources allow. SM

I would recommend that either Steve or myself call Bittenbender to recommend Kirk House - we met with him on the RTO discussions.

Jim

We should do it..you all figure out who is best person is. Thanks.

I received a call from Dan Clearfield this morn.  Nora Mead-Brownell has asked for his assistance in getting marketers to call the governor's office in support of Kirk House who is a former aide and is seeking the position of Small Business Advocate.  Mr. House is a supporter of competition and would be helpful in that position.  Apparently, the electric companies are opposing him. I would recommend that we make the call and I would be happy to do so, however, there are others who may have better contacts than I do (such as Sue in her work with the Governors),  Please advise.

Janine  

Here is the name and number of the person in the Gov's office that deals with utility issues:  Fritz Bittenbender,783-2896.  The appointment is made by the Gov. (Schweiker).  He has two top aides:  Mark Campbell and Dave Sanko.  I can get you current phone #s for the latter people if you wish them.   Thanks for whatever help Enron can be.

Thanks for the update - I'll keep my fingers crossed.

ok.  

Hey, buddie.  Mike and Sue still differ.  We're getting the transcript to verify.  I told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a "quip" from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics.  They both agreed.  Soon as we get the transcript, we'll fill you in.  Let me know if this works for you.  (Please be easy with Sue, she's pretty tense.)

Best,

I think that Christi's write up is great.  I've only changed two things.  If anyone has any more changes, please get to Janel ASAP.

Pls let me know.

Sue --

Please work with Diann to determine if their calculations are tariff driven=
 or simply an internal process of SCE.

Thanks,

Jim

As a matter of fact, I disputed their calculations when I was there.  They =
are basing our deposits on the total charges rather than just the transmiss=
ion and distribution charges, which is all we are responsible for.  Accordi=
ng to them, they do not distinguish between DA and bundled charges.

Jim, do you feel we have any recourse in challenging SCE's methodology for =
calculating these requirements?

Do we have no way to confirm the validiity of the amount required?  There h=
as to be some tariff driven requirement or I am just dreaming?

Bill

Bill, SCE's security requirements are based on their projected bill amounts=
 for each account that will switch.  They are the ones to calculate this.  =
I will contact Kim Santa Cruz today and see if they have increased their re=
quirements since August 9.

Diann,

We need to read the tariff and understand SCE's security requirement and th=
en extrapolate potential requirements based on our expected load.

Wanda - do you have time to help with this analysis?

Does it make sense to offer the guaranty for $50mm and move on?

Let's discuss,
Bill

Diann,

When I spoke with Kim, she suggested that I direct the question to credit, =
hence the inquiry.

Clement

Bill, not sure what "effective" date is needed.    Our customer accounts be=
gan switching to direct access in late June.  As for the maximum requiremen=
t, the amount is dictated by SCE.  When I met with Kim Santa Cruz, et al, o=
n August 9, the amount they calculated for EESO was at $37,111,872.  It is =
likely that amount has gone up, but I have received no official request sin=
ce then.

Clement, do you know what the latest security requirement is?

Diann,

Do you have a view on the effective date?  What is the maximum guaranty req=
uirement under the direct access?  We should probably put the cap north of =
that level.

Please advise,
Bill

Teresa,

Myself and Kim Santa Cruz of SCE have agreed in principal to the format of =
the guarantee to be provided by Enron Corp.  The only matters to be finaliz=
ed with respect to the guarantee is the effective date and aggregate cap am=
ount of the guaranty.  Could you supply this remaining information?=20

Thanks,=20

Clem

Teresa,

Please work with Diann's team and Treasury to see if we can issue a 2 month=
 surety while Clem works out the details on the guaranty format.  Work with=
 Diann's team and SCE to validate the $ amount.  Use Veronica Gonzalez to h=
elp if necessary.  Make sure formats on surety are approved by EES legal.  =
Hopefully we will be able to replace with a guaranty in a couple of months.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Given the nature of progress in the past, I wouldn't want to hang my hat on=
 saying that the guaranty can be completed within a day or two.  What I can=
 do to push the process ahead quicker is to provide comments to the extent =
that they are absolute and necessary and then leave it with Southern to say=
 that they can or cannot accommodate us.  Is there any possibility of uppin=
g the surety bond support for a short period until this can be handled?

Clem

Clem,

This process has been ongoing and we should have been continuing to pursue =
this guaranty.  Sorry for any confusion if you feel this has been late noti=
ce.  We need to resolve this issue ASAP.  If you are unavailable, we have t=
he option to issue a surety bond at some cost.  Please advise if you feel w=
e should pursue this option given the short time frame.

Bill

Teresa,

Teresa, I believe you understand what the negotiation pattern has been betw=
een Enron Corp. and Southern California Edison.  It has not changed, especi=
ally given the fact that once again I have received a form of guaranty that=
 is different than before and would need to be modified in order to be acce=
ptable to Enron Corp.  I received the guaranty and have not been able to ad=
dress it because I have been busy preparing items for the upcoming Enron Co=
rp. board meeting.  And, just as in the past, Enron Corp. and Southern Cali=
fornia Edison has not been able to come to any agreement as to what the for=
m will look like.  My question is, why is it the case that it is the ninth =
hour when it is determined that Enron Corp. has to deliver a guaranty, espe=
cially to Southern California Edison (a Counterparty where it is well known=
 that there will be problems with the format)?  Surely, we are keeping trac=
k of our credit limits and the time frames in which they can to be exceeded=
.  There will be a negotiation process and it may not necessarily meet the =
time frame that you have mentioned below.

Clement   =20

Clement - On Monday I sent you a request via email and fax regarding the ne=
ed to put in place a Enron Corp Guaranty for Enron Energy Marketing Corp.(E=
EMC) to Southern California Edison.  This has now become very urgent, since=
 EEMC is now close to going over their current credit limit.  Please let me=
 know as soon as possible what the status is.  Thanks, Teresa

Thanks for asking.  This is a very strange place.  Our core trading is doing very well.  It appears that management decided to put some huge bets at the Corporate level without any risk management.  

I'm doing very well.  Marianna is expecting our 2nd child next May.  Grace continues to grow and become a little person.

Hope you and your family is doing well.

Jim

Jim -
 
Heard that there are some problems at Enron.  You  okay?

I didn't know that I was all powerful....

And so he gets!!
 
--Independent RTOs are necessary now in order to provide comparable, non-discriminatory service to all customers 
--All uses of the transmission grid should be under the RTO tariff
--RTOs should be of sufficient scope to provide efficiencies and follow the natural traded markets
--The RTO should operate real time energy markets that include demand side bidding to promote efficiency

In preparation of NARUC, Jim wants us to handout the Bare Essentials from EPSA and the Well-Designed RTO documents.  He also wants a one-page/4 bullet-point list of message points that EVERYONE should convey while at NARUC.  
 
Would you mind drafting up those 4 key points?  You can just send me an email and I will format and send everything out to everyone this afternoon.  
 
Thanks!!

Barbara --

Any decision on the payment?

Jim

	Remember the invoice I faxed to Barbara?  Can I delete from my IPayIt "Inbox", is she paying from her side?  

Just to keep you in the loop on SCE negotiations.

Jim

As we anticipated, today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with Edison.
Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money.
The call was short and ended with an agreement that:
	1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 
	2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 
	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.

If anyone has any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Who will attend and present?

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group
       NERC Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
             Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
             Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy

DATE: November 8, 2001

RE: Industry Meeting Regarding the Wholesale Electricity
      Standard Organization

The Department of Energy (DOE) is sponsoring an industry wide meeting facilitated by EPSA, ELCON and the National Energy Marketers Association.  This forum will be held on December 7th, and is designed to provide an opportunity for open discussion on the organizational structure needed to represent the wholesale electric interests in the development of market-based standards and types of standards that should be addressed.  As with the previous industry-wide meetings held on standards development activities for the wholesale and retail natural gas and electric topics, the DOE has graciously offered its facilities for the meeting site.  The meeting specifics are below and a draft agenda is attached.

WHERE:	Department of Energy
	Forrestal Building
                1000 Independence Avenue, S.W.
	Washington, D.C. 20585

ROOM:	Large Auditorium, Room GE-086

WHEN:	Friday, December 7th
 	10:00 a.m.  to  5:00 p.m.

The nature of the debate should address the framework for an organization whose role would be to develop wholesale electric standards, including scope of activity, segments for each of the industry quadrants, and any additional key principles that are necessary.  As supporting information for the meeting is prepared, which would include a more detailed agenda, it will be posted on the GISB web site, (www.gisb.org) and sent out to both the Regulatory Affairs Committee and the NERC Working Group.  A draft agenda for the meeting is attached.

If you are unable to attend the meeting, or would like to provide written comments in addition to attendance, please provide them to the GISB office via email (contact:  gisb@aol.com) by December 3rd.  The work papers and comments received by December 3rd will be posted on GISB's web site (www.gisb.org) and emailed to all registered participants on December 4th.  The meeting will be transcribed and transcripts will be available for purchase.

The DOE has security procedures for visitors, so those intending to attend the meeting should notify the GISB office (contact: gisb@aol.com) by end of business Monday, December 3rd and provide the following information:

? Name of Attendee
? Company Represented
? Phone Number
? Email Address
? Fax Number
? Country of Citizenship

In addition to its normal security process, the DOE has additional security measures if should you bring in cell phones or laptop computers.  The auditorium has very limited number of power outlets for laptops, and it is advised not to bring them to the meeting.  Should you need to bring in a cell phone or a laptop, you should allow more time for a longer procedure for checking through security.   The auditorium has a seating capacity of 200, with limited standing room.  An attendance list will be provided to the DOE to facilitate the sign in procedures, and will be made available at the meeting.

Please feel free to contact Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 if you have any questions or comments.

Should we work through AReM?

Jim

On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday).

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

Hi Jim,

This is Mike Gelin, formerly of URM now with ETS under Eric Gadd and Stephen Dowd, we met on the plane on the way to D.C.  I was recruiting at Howard and you were going to listen in on that Supreme Court case.  Just wanted to drop a line to you and see how you were doing.  Maybe if you have time we can sit and chat while having some coffee downstairs.  

Mike,
X 54917

FYI

1) I received E-mail that they may talk tonite about their right to to terminate, but the intention given no news was to continue forward "90% probability"
2) Ed Munoz, Raytheon Reg Affairs, stated yesterday that his sources believed yesterday that if the PUC acted today, 9/15 would have been the date
3) While on the phone with me, Jennifer Stone (attorney) received an e-mail from CMTA's Dorothy Rothrock (please see below, lists major CMTA members being fed the CMTA Line) regarding expected CPUC & Legislative actions 
4) Facility Mgmt view is that "state/DWR fuel costs could escalate if military actions occur and that Enron contract is a hedge to this volatility"
5) Raytheon has been notified we are not forwarding the Petition just Yet, "fine" I would feel better sending it in next week directly to Raytheon VP Legal after polish
6) Several of the Team members of Raytheon will be out tomorrow & next week, I doubt a week extension would give them much more comfort, but would probably be a nice to have.
7) Attorneys are still concerned about exit fees even if date is 9/1 or beyond, but they knew this throughout our contract negotiations and expect fees to not exceed savings
Sorry - Idid forget to do this before I went to lunch.  My head is
cluttered today!

TO: CMTA Energy Committee
FROM:      Dorothy Rothrock
SUBJECT: Legislative Update

As of this morning, we have not seen language from the Senate to replace
the SBX2 78 that passed out of the Assembly last week.  Rumors are that the
elements of SBX2 78 will be broken apart into separate bills, put into
Assembly bills now in the Senate, and sent over to the Assembly for
concurrence today or tomorrow.  There will probably be a hearing in Senate
Energy this afternoon on the issues.

We have been working to gain bipartisan support for direct access, assuming
that it will be pulled from the MOU and run as a separate bill, if at all.
It is likely that direct access as a stand alone issue does not have the
votes because of concerns about small customer opposition and a big
business "jail break."  Our only chance is a coalition of Republicans and
moderate Democrats that requires the CPUC to suspend direct access, letting
customers currently on direct access maintain (and renew) their contracts,
and hopefully preserving the right for future direct access without fees if
there is net short.  Given the short time we have left, and that we have no
leverage if the issue is separate from the SCE MOU, I fear this is a long
shot.

In the absence of legislation to overturn ABX1 1, the CPUC will probably
suspend direct access later this month.  The proposed decision would leave
open "the effect to be given to contracts signed before today, including
renewals of such contracts" to a later decision. (Draft proposed decision
issued September 6, 2001, not yet acted upon.)

The other information at this time is that the Senate will propose MOU
language similar to what originally went over to the assembly in SBX2 78 -
a cut-off for paying SCE debt of greater than 20kw (probably 100kw and
over) and no direct access.  SCE has previously stated that this is
insufficient to allow them to issue bonds, thus no creditors could be paid
and bankruptcy would follow.  CMTA will oppose an MOU bill that proposes a
disproportionate spread of the debt without any counterbalancing value to
us such as direct access.

Another piece of this puzzle is the Renewable Portfolio Standard  (SB 532)
that was attached to the SBX2 78 in order to gain some Democrat support in
the Assembly.  SB 532 bill got stuck in assembly U&C, but will come over
from the Senate in another bill.  CMTA worked to get some improvements in
this bill, including a procedure that could lower the cost cap from 1.5
cents and in exchange withdrew opposition.  We are NOT in support. My guess
is that this bill could pass in the Assembly, and I wanted to make it
"better." The other business groups have not yet determined their
positions.

I will call Pam with updates to share with you in the next few days.

thanks

Thanks,

Jim

I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Jim

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a "public interest" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and "load up" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific "Christmas tree ornaments."

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a "rubber stamp" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

                                                        Mike

Please get internal comments from Thane Twiggs, Sue Mara, Steve Walton, Dan Staines, and Dave Perrino before letting Doug go public with this document.  I want to make sure that we are correct in some of our analysis (for example, I think that you may have misinterpreted the FERC in the California discussion).

Jim
Christi, Mike:

As per your request, please find enclosed my first draft of the Balanced Schedules White Paper - to be used by Doug  in Ercot.

If you think the graphs help illustrate the points, they should be inserted and cross-referenced as part of the chapter " can reliability be jeopardized if balanced schedules are abadoned"? (cross-reference is relative straightforward as graphs as described in the text)

 << File: BALANCED SCHEDULES.doc >>  << File: Graphs.ppt >>

So the short answer is that EES needs to change its procedures?  Also, is t=
he 50kw right for all markets?

Jim

Jim,

Review of the past due process flow chart shows substantial compliance with=
 the rules, except that the final notice (termination notice) in the 2nd ch=
art must specify a termination date that is not less than 10 days from date=
 notice was issued. Thus the next action cannot commence earlier than the 2=
3rd day per this time line. However, under the rules EES can issue the term=
ination notice any time after the 2nd day following the past due date, ie o=
n or at any time after the 5 days set in the first chart. Please note that =
for larger than >50KW customers, EES can by agreement with the customer, fu=
rther shorten the timeline in the rules.

To facilitate full compliance with the rules regarding valid reasons for te=
rmination, issuance of termination notice, and contents of the notice, I ha=
ve provided short attachements of rule requirements.

ok

Jim,

Ray and I talked.   DETM's proposal is reasonably clear:  a new cap would be set  whenever the proxy index exceeds 110% (or goest below 90%) of the current cap.  At that time, it is reset.  This is about as good as you can get with a gas proxy, and the traders can live with it

Ray and I recommend that we not explain this in our pleading since it dilutes our message: make it the "hightest of" the 3 proxies.

In terms of no refund if below the cap:  Ray may add something but everyone seems to be in a agreement that transactions below the cap are final.  Even TFG did not raise that issue in its comments.

GAC

In our discussion of the Duke model, we don't outline when the cap would be set?  Would the Duke model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we don't exceed.  Maybe make this point stronger.

Rogers --

FERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of "security" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.  I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.  I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.  FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.  

Retail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.  Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.

Thanks.

Several articles in todays publications discuss possible implications to federal and state initiatives.  Bill Wicker, spokesman for Senate Energy Committee mentioned that it was too early to determine how energy policy might be affected.  INGAA's Halvorsen  hinted at a probable  policy shift - more focus on energy security for the time being.  Any information or insights would be helpful.  I was already feeling as though ERCOT implementation would be delayed given the disastrous pilot performance and am now even more convinced.  Arkansas just recommended a complete shelving of their deregulation initiatives.  These types of issues will have a significant impact on our current book of business as well as future decisions.

Thanks,
Rogers 

I hope you are having fun at the Nutcracker Market.  Tell Christi and Susan hello.

I like it.  Our argument should be that the MISO is not an Indiana public utility.  I'd put it in the dialogue just to keep from having the process work out poorly.

Jim

Janine:

Below is a short response I have drafted if we choose to respond (although it is not clear to me that a response is necessary) to these emails.  I'm a little unclear about the positions of the people in the emails.  I think our best response to Ron (Cinergy) is that MISO does not serve load, so MISO is not accountable to IURC.  Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility?  If we agree with that statement, are they subject to any IURC oversight?  Even if they are, I don't think it should be because of the "bundled" retail load issue, but rather because IURC has the right to regulate all "public utilities" (perhaps for safety reasons?) within its state.  But if we agree that IURC does have some authority over MISO as an Indiana Public Utility, then we may need to revise the statement below.

I did not go into the issue of whether there will be any "bundled retail load" in Indiana once MISO is operating.  In a prior order, FERC says that all transmission must be under the MISO tariff.  If this is the case, one could argue that the service is no longer "bundled" but I don't think we want to get into that argument with these guys.  

Here is some language that I put together.  What does everyone else think?

The MISO is a FERC jurisdictional entity that will provide interstate transmission service throughout its region.  MISO will not serve retail load, nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers.  Therefore, we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC.  

Responsibility for serving retail customers will remain with the individual entities who are currently responsible for serving those customers.  They will contract for transmission service with the MISO and will have the obligation to serve their retail customers.  It will be these load serving entities who are accountable to the IURC, not MISO.

I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Jim

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a "public interest" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and "load up" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific "Christmas tree ornaments."

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a "rubber stamp" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

The tough question may be taking a long-term cash committment and transforming it into a single NPV payment (discount rate issues), assuming that is part of the options.

Jim

Rick -- As discussed, here is a brief updated status of the Michigan regulatory status as it pertains to QFs in the state.  In the debates over PA 141 we won several key points pertaining to OFs and agreements with utilities.  As you also know, the retail market will open 1/1/02 and MPSC decisions are expected within the next two weeks or so.  I have not covered the retail market because the previous status did not focus on that market segment.  If I can be of further help, please let me know.

Darran --
 
Pls submit an RCR for me to discuss at today's meeting.  RCR - EPSA SE RTO Study.  $60k.
 
Jim
I agree we need to do it.  You may want to ask Boston Pacific to include an analysis of the savings associated with reduction in capacity reserves ( reductions due to increased load diversity, increased reserve sharing and reduced operating reserves to meet NERC criteria).  Some of these savings should be immediate and some should occur over the next few years from decreased need for capacity additions.  I'm not sure whether someone has done this type of analysis before for one of the RTOs, but Christi has talked about some of this and may know.

I would say we go ahead and support this.  I am guessing that 4 other companies would join = $60k for Enron.  What do you think?  I want to get back with Julie by next Tuesday - I'll submit an RCR for discussions.

Jim 

Attached is a proposal from Boston Pacific for a cost-benefit analysis of a southeastern RTO.  Please send your thoughts to Julie Simon at jsimon@epsa.org by Tuesday, November 13th.

Then let's proceed with that model.  Someone needs to tell Jean B. not to get involved.

Jim

AReM decided to intervene for now and see how/when/if it should get active in the proceeding.
Should we work through AReM?

Jim

On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday).

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

Christi --

Let's talk.  

We are arguing against NERC, but Kevin needs to understand that something must be in its place. We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is Enron's approach.  Have you communicated that to Kevin?  

Also, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.  Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.

Jim

John -- Kevin Presto, head of East Power Trading, had these comments:

Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards -- Kevin says, "NERC should be eliminated."

Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure: -- Kevin says that the "uniform reporting to consumers, in monthly electric bills, of the known energy sources" is not good because it supports day-ahead source requirements for retail suppliers.  Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose how to source their portfolio, whether from bilateral contracts done on an ahead basis or purchases in the spot market.  

John, the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill may alleviate this concern, but I don't know enough about how that works.  Several years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clean energy generator and it can trade those credits.  Therefore, the seller of clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean credits in order to claim it sold clean energy (meaning that the clean generator was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount of credits).  That program recognized that you can't specifically source a clean generator to a load because electricity doesn't flow that way.  Thus, portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported.  But I don't know how this bill's provisions would work.  You probably have the Enron experts on this (used to be Janel G.)  Thanks.

In what forum will this be discussed?

Jim

?			Filing due November 15th
?
Attached is EPSA's motion to intervene and protest in the WestConnect RTO filing (Docket Nos. EL02-9-000 and RT02-1-000).  The draft primarily focuses on independence and governance issues, however also highlights the WestConnect tariff, congestion management, market monitoring, pricing and interconnection aspects of the filing.  For example, the draft argues that the participating transmission owners retain too much authority over RTO operations, that FERC should require all RTO load to take service under the WestConnect tariff, and that WestConnect should adopt the GridFlorida market monitoring plan.

Interventions are due to FERC on Thursday, November 15th.  Please have any edits or comments to Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org by noon on Wednesday, November 14th.   We'll also discuss the draft on this week's Regulatory Affairs conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 3:30 P.M. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.

Thanks.  Let me know how the desk sees it.  Also, please make sure that we talk with EES gas (Don Black).

Jim

I reviewed the EPSA filing, and I have no problems, but Becky is going to run it by the desk to make sure it is okay with them.  Becky and I have been talking about what we will file and I plan to work on that today and tomorrow, but here is the thumbnail of it.

FERC is trying in the rule to give intraday recall rights to releasing shippers.   If this applies to all transactions, it obviously devalues and degrades capacity releases.  The proper approach is let the parties negotiate the arrangements they want and for the payment to reflect the level of firmness actually given.  In other words, if a releasing shipper wants the recall rights that FERC would give them as a matter of law in this rule, then they spell those rights out in their posting and negotiate the deal with that on the table.  If a shipper is willing to release capacity and forego any recall rights, they should be able to do this, and receive payment that reflects the nature of that service.  But having a rule that mandates recall that cannot be negotiated is uncalled for and contrary to the purposes of capacity release and open access.

Thanks.

Jim,

I was not aware EPSA was filing an intervention to the WestConnect tariff.  After a cursory review of the attachment however, it very much lines up with what I have sent to Ray and Steve.  We focus a bit more on the lack of definition of a congestion management plan as well as hit on "hints" of where WestConnect is probably going to stay (contract path) based upon some clues in the filing.  We focus more on existing contracts (lack of conversion) as well as additional comments on the planning appendix.  They hit just about every other point we cover, independence, or lack thereof being the key.

Thanks,

Dave

The meeting location has been changed to EB 2844.

Thank you,
Rubena

We have reserved room EB 4746 from 3:15-4 pm today to discuss status on the SoCal margin agreement.  SoCal is still holding to the deadline of tomorrow; this morning I asked for a couple of additional days while we work through the details but they have not yet agreed to an extension.

We need to cover, at a minimum -
1) suggested wording changes to the agreement 2) sign off on operational coordination between EES and ENA 3) agreement from Credit to the change  4) understanding of final internal signoffs necessary    

Lisa -

While Wanda and I with the FERC team agreed on a process of moving forward, I want to make sure that the documents properly deal with how the FERC haircut will be handled.  When will you have a new version to read?

Jim

thanks

we have not sent anything to pg&e and probably won't until get closer...

Thanks.

Mike Grigsby and Scott Neal both agree that they don't have any objection to intraday recall as long as it is an option that the releasing shipper can select as part of the initial release and they would know up front if a package they were bidding on was recallable mid-day - just another product which they would price accordingly.  Leslie thinks the optionality of it is contained in the order, but we'll file comments requesting clarification since it's not addressed head-on.  I invited Don Black to the meeting we just had, but it was over so quickly he never made it.  I will run this by him as well.

Thanks.  Let me know how the desk sees it.  Also, please make sure that we talk with EES gas (Don Black).

Jim

I reviewed the EPSA filing, and I have no problems, but Becky is going to run it by the desk to make sure it is okay with them.  Becky and I have been talking about what we will file and I plan to work on that today and tomorrow, but here is the thumbnail of it.

FERC is trying in the rule to give intraday recall rights to releasing shippers.   If this applies to all transactions, it obviously devalues and degrades capacity releases.  The proper approach is let the parties negotiate the arrangements they want and for the payment to reflect the level of firmness actually given.  In other words, if a releasing shipper wants the recall rights that FERC would give them as a matter of law in this rule, then they spell those rights out in their posting and negotiate the deal with that on the table.  If a shipper is willing to release capacity and forego any recall rights, they should be able to do this, and receive payment that reflects the nature of that service.  But having a rule that mandates recall that cannot be negotiated is uncalled for and contrary to the purposes of capacity release and open access.

Is everything ok??

JIM please call me about this!
thanks.
I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Jim

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a "public interest" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and "load up" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific "Christmas tree ornaments."

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a "rubber stamp" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

                                                        Mike

RTO Week at FERC Leads to Lifting of December Deadline

Nov. 11 (California Energy Markets)

Following up on a week-long series of workshops it called
"RTO Week," the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
issued an order on November 7 to clarify its expectations
for the development of regional transmission organizations
throughout the country [RM01-12]. In addition to
acknowledging the comments it received at the workshops
during the week of October 15-19, it seemed clear from the
order that the federal commissioners heard loud and clear
the message being conveyed at FERC's Western regional
infrastructure workshop held last week in Seattle--"don't
fence us in."

The FERC order tactfully backpedaled from the commission's
recent assertions that it would like to see four regional
RTOs in the country and made particular, though veiled,
reference to Western parties' objections to a regionwide
RTO: "In the West, it is now apparent that the presence of
three sub-regional organizations (bound by a workable
seams agreement) under a larger umbrella organization has
the potential to succeed."

With this statement, FERC left open the likelihood that
the California Independent System Operator, WestConnect
(the successor to Desert Star) and RTO West in the
Northwest would continue to have operational jurisdiction
for transmission services in their respective regions.

FERC also clarified that it intends to proceed in
developing RTOs on two parallel tracks. In the pending RTO
dockets already filed at FERC, it will resolve the
geographic scope and governance issues of the RTOs. In the
docket in which this order was issued, the commission will
take up the thorny issues of transmission tariff and
market-design rulemaking. The commission also recognized
that market activities need not all fall under the rubric
of a stand-alone RTO. For instance, it stated, the Midwest
ISO, Alliance and the Southwest Power Pool have proposed
forming one market-monitoring unit.

The order paid special attention to inviting the
participation of state regulators in developing viable RTO
structures. FERC will be creating state-federal RTO panels
and will seek their advice on the makeup of regional
markets. FERC said it will also be meeting with investors
in order to better understand financing of transmission
projects as well as independent transmission companies.
The commission reiterated its support of both for-profit
transcos and nonprofit ISOs and "any reasonable
combination of the two."

FERC gave itself and those responsible for developing
workable transmission organizations some breathing room as
well. Recognizing that RTO development was at various
stages throughout the country, it backed off from the
December 15 operational deadline established in Order No.
2000. Rather, the commission will establish timelines
addressing the development of RTOs in each general region
in future orders [Shauna O'Donnell].

Gary --

Do you still have a contact at Waste Management?  I hear their financial troubles seem to be under control.  Just wanted to start some inquiries?

Jim

 

I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  

The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?
  
Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?  
Do we have any construction in progress?  
Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?

Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?

Thanks,

Jim

Sue --

Here is the list of key customers in CA that may support our efforts.  Please work with Tom Riley to coordinate.

Jim

Jim,

Attached is an updated list of customer's likely interested in supporting our regulatory and legislative DA efforts.  This is slightly updated from the list we sent week before.

Let me know if you still need help soliciting customer support.

Tom
 

We spoke with Roger Yang.  They don't have anything on the shelf.  I started to look at the PG&E web site and figured out that you'd have to have a PhD in Oper Research to re-compute the PX Credit on an hourly basis.

Jim

Jim,

Other than doing it in house, I would recommend MRW to compute the PX credit, which is a function of market purchases, CAISO charges, losses, load shape effects, etc.

GAC

Harry --

FYI.  

Evan, Thanks. The networking has begun. I, Jim and Harry met with Rebecca and Craig yesterday and explored the interface between Services and GA.
We identified several areas of collaboration and networking opportunities. It was a very positive meeting. I and Rebecca have scheduled to meet to outline the process.The effort will aim at bringing our two processes together to insure that we avoid any misinformation or suprises regarding all new market issues, and above all, to make sure that all our bases are covered.

Gloria
Gloria,

Thank you for your note.  You did not offended me in any way that I am aware.

Frankly, Jim and I were discussing the appropriate routing of information to the EES Senior Management Team.  I believe that in any situation other than health or safety issues we have an obligation to factor in all constituents (ie. Rebecca Fite in this situation) and gain the facts before issuing statements about a topic that includes the President of our company in the distribution. 

I do value and appreciate your contributions on the ConEd efforts that preceded your e-mail regarding the Illinois Certification.  Unfortunately, your e-mail (that contained a key inaccuracy) caused several additional e-mails to be circulated and caused a bit of confusion.  In the future -- I agree wtih you and would like to avoid as much confusion as possible.

If you think it best -- I would welcome a meeting between Jim and you and Rebecca and me to better understand how to work together.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Evan   

 

Evan,
I was standing beside Jim Steffes last thursday, when you gave him your "editorial" of me. In the 2 weeks that I worked with you on ConEd, I did not realise that I offended you in any way, personally or professionally. I have also had similar negative feedback from Jason Woodward, and I have never met or worked with him. 
Before your group assumed the new market role for EES, I worked very closely with Peter Vint, Robert Gresch, Beth Goodman and their groups on all new market issues. 
We worked as a team, and no matter at what point of the new market spectrum problems came up, we all pitched in to resolve the issues. Your group appears to have a more territorial approach to new market issues, and in the past have rejected my offers and efforts at networking. I have tried to respect that.

Prior to sending out the IL analysis, I placed a call to your group indicating that I was working on that analysis, and had some questions. I did not get a call back. Taking the time to return that call, may have saved us all some uneccessary stress. Well, good things do sometimes come from bad situations. The good thing is that we have all seen the need for a closer approach to new market entry issues. I intend to work with your group to develop a mutually acceptable level of interaction and interface.

Thanks,
Gloria

Gloria,

Thank for getting this done.

Evan

FYI

Gloria,
This is to confirm Con Edison's receipt of Enron Energy Services' wire for
billing agency security in the amount of $1 million.  Enron Energy Services'
cash deposit is subject to the NYS PSC approved interest rate for "other
customer capital".  Please note that interest will be paid on an annual
basis, and that the "other customer capital" interest rate changes each
calendar year.

Based on Enron Energy Services' successful completion of Con Edison's
billing agency test using hard copy bills, and our receipt of the signed
billing agency agreement and security deposit in the amount of $1 million,
Enron Energy Services may now begin enrolling new accounts with billing
agency status.  We will immediately code Enron Energy Services' existing
customer account population with billing agency status, as well.  As
previously agreed, Con Edison will express mail the bills produced each day
for Enron Energy Services' customer account population using Enron Energy
Services' Airborne Express account number to the address shown below:
	CSC BILLING DEPT
	700 MILAM NORTH TOWER 6FL
	HOUSTON, Texas  77002

Lastly, any future changes to Enron Energy Services' security coverage
amount or type will be done in strict accordance with the standards set
forth in the Uniform Business Practices.

If you have any other questions or comments, feel free to contact me.

Ok to travel.

Jim
I assume this is ok, let me know otherwise.

I think they are closed in the afternoon.

On a different topic, I need to travel to Wash., D.C. on the evening of Nov. 28 and return the evening of the 29th, for a FERC meeting.  Go ahead and see what's available; I assume the expenditure is OK, but you might double check with Jim.  It's for a matter that is important to the Services group, and they've asked me to attend.

Tried calling, no answer.

Line was so long this a.m., I did not get my shot because I had to leave for a meeting.  Can you check to see whether they have any vaccine left?

	Did yall get your shot?  Line was short when I went to Credit Union at lunch......FYI

Yes.  Have fun.

Jim

Jim,

Paul ok'd this but wanted me to get approval from you too.  I made these travel plans about 3 weeks ago (seems like a year ago).
Paul,

I am unclear about travel policy at this point:

I need to go to CAISO  market issue forum (aka MIF)  and a 3-RTO conference on market monitoring on Th, Fri in Sacto, SF respectively.  Sue M could go to former but wouldn't be the best for the latter.

Total savings if I do not go (i.e., net of cancellation fees): ~$400

OK to go?

Thanks Chip.  If you hear anything else, please let me know.

Jim

Jim:

With regard to ERCOT:

Ponderosa Pine is the Cleburne IPP that we purchased from Tenaska last year--it is sometimes called "Cornhusker".  Brazos Electric Coop is the power purchaser under a long-term PPA.

There is no capacity available or committed under the DC tie ("TexMex" or "Salsa").  The project is not fully developed, however, an application for a Presidential Permit is in process.  We do have agreements with the Brownsville Public Utility Board related to the development of the project--Dave Forster is the commercial contact.

The only construction in progress I am aware of is Indian Mesa I & II (Enron Wind Projects)--I will follow-up with you tomorrow on this.

We have a Services Agreement with the Fronterra project.  I believe AEP is the owner.  Enron has no equity ownership, only management responsibility--Tom May is the commercial contact.

I cannot think of anything else, but I will talk with a few others tomorrow.  I would encourage you to also check with Dave Forster, head of origination for the central U.S.

Hope this helps.

Dear Reader:

A new world is unfolding and you're in it.  The industry you know is
changing into one no one has ever seen and you'll probably be a part of it.

That's why we've created Restructuring Today -- to report to you the
twists, the plans, failures, strategies, shocks, absurdities, new sales
and buying methods as energy and communications converge into American's
biggest industry.

Add the $220 billion power industry to the $80 billion gas industry and
merge in the $200+ billion communications industry and you're
talking big bucks.  Restructuring Today is focused down the road,
reporting where the industry's headed every business day.

Our editors will tell you what the CEOs making the big decision are
thinking and planning on.  And those editors cover more seminars than
you could imagine going to (or paying for).  They're guided by a network
of correspondents in state capitals - most of them business editors of
important newspapers.

You can call 1-800-486-8201 anytime with your questions because that
keeps us up on what our readers want to know.  The news is readable
because Restructuring Today's editors write the way people talk -- not in
the language of the Federal Register.

Analysis:  Restructuring Today is not written by recent journalism
graduates.  Our editors are directed not to write what the news is but
to report what the news means.  Readers often tell us that Restructuring
Today's analysis is what they find especially useful.

Urgent:  We have enjoyed being able to send you a few copies of
Restructuring Today and if you would like to benefit from our special,
unique focus on convergence and new markets, simply fax the
completed attached order form and I'll make sure you don't miss a
single, vital issue.

Cordially,

Season Hawksley
Marketing Manager
800-486-8201

PS:  While the turmoil in California and the west has eased up, the
forward thrust continues.  Congress and the new FERC are out to
change our world.  Stay tuned and if at any time you decide
Restructuring Today isn't worth more than you paid for it, we'll refund
your entire subscription price.

Not quite sure who/what ponderosa is but we have sandhill Austin of which we control 100 MW thru Oct 03. We also have assorted asset management deals but they amount to advisory roles. We did have a deal in the works with the Cleburne Facility that was formerly owned by Tenaska. Carl Tricoli is your man on that one.

Met with Charles yesterday and outlined what I saw as needs and opportunities. He said he will be getting back to you on it.

Take care,

Doug

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication

Steve, 

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our "Negative CTC Credits" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

Thanks.    

Rick -- Let's discuss bad messaging at NARUC meeting at our Thursday meeting.

Jim

Tom et al--you guys could do color commentary! And yes, your visit to Pennsylvania was obviously presuasive. Thanks for the update.  

Rick/Jim/Sue--one of the things we need to talk about in a general context is how we are going to address the Enron swipes in these types of forums.  I imagine they are going to continue for many months to come and my initial thought is to make sure that we have Enron people at as many forums and conferences as there are out there and not shy away from public visibility. I'm not sure how I feel about whether we should be trying to get spots on the panels and whether if we do that, it should be a high level person like a Rick or a Jim.  A strategic discussion on this issue in the near term would be appreciated.

Monday's NARUC convention consisted of three sessions, 1)opening remarks; 2) FERC RTO Policy Update; and 3) a session on attracting capital to the energy infrastructure. 

1)	Opening Remarks - The convention opened with remarks by NARUC President William Nugent, FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell, PA PUC Chairman Glenn Thomas (substituting for former Governor Ridge), and the featured speaker Comcast Cable President Brian Roberts.  
a.	Nugent rambled on about how this is an interesting period we are in and how regulators are being challenges and didn't much of anything.
b.	Brownell introduced a Georgia Commissioner named Bubba who sang several patriotic songs (she did not address anything relative to FERC policy or activity)
c.	Thomas spoke about the great state of PA, Benjamin Franklin, William Penn, and Philadelphia and also did not address anything related to policy
d.	Roberts talked about the future of cable television.
2)	The FERC Policy Update - this panel consisted of moderator Nugent, FERC Staff Dan Larcamp, Southern Company Chairman Allen Franklin, James Torgenson of DPL, and PA Commissioner Terence Fitzpatrick.  
a.	Larcamp and did not provide very much information or in-site into FERC RTO policy.  He did say that they are looking at compatible market rules and protocols across all the RTO's (what he didn't say was that they would be the same rules and protocols).  He said that they are looking at 3 RTO's at least,  In the Midwest the Alliance is moving forward and MISO is getting bigger with the addition of SPP and that FERC is looking at if the Midwest RTO should be 1 or 2 RTO's; in the Northeast they are looking to resolve the governance and market views issues and that all views must be considered (I took this to mean that on governance they are going to go three/three/three from each ISO, but others I talked with outside the session didn't get that - time will tell); and the Southeast will be slower to develop, there are small but clear regional differences that are important, and that it must accommodate the for-profits and the not-for-profits (public power).
b.	Franklin from Southern said that the state commissioners are ultimately held accountable for RTO's (interesting comment) and there are two major issues to be considered in forming RTO's - cost and reliability and that neither can be taken for granted.  He promoted variable electric transmission pricing similar to natural gas transportation rates and not postage stamp rates (he used the example that in his service territory natural gas is located in the southeast part of the territory while load is centered in the north, but since there is a single electrical transmission rate generation is built close to the natural gas source to avoid the variable gas transmission rate).  He promoted the SETRANS model to accommodate the many public power entities in the south.
c.	Torgenson of DPL gave a very dry overview of the status of MISO with nothing new to report.
d.	Fitzpatrick of PA (one of the Commissioners Steffes, Montovano, and I met with in July) began by stating the PA Commission is fully supportive of the NERTO (must have been our July meeting) for two reasons i) advantages of a bigger market, and ii) FERC's clear preference for PJM as the platform.  He mentioned the concern of commissions in other PJM states but, in general there is support.  He then went on to stress the merits of DSM.
3)	The last session on infrastructure capital was the most entertaining from an Enron perspective (we have quickly  become the fodder for case studies and Enron is now a verb that is more akin to a four-letter verb.  The panel consisted of moderator Iowa Commissioner Diane Munns, Charles Cicchetti of Pacific Economic Group, Jeff Miller of J.P. Morgan Partners, Christine Uspenski of Schwab Capital Markets, and Walter Rogers of Merrill Lynch Asset Management.
a.	Cicchetti said that wholesale deregulation has made state regulators' job harder and that they must be market participants (he used the term GONZO market participants).  He also thinks that if transmission planning and expansion is left to the RTO's, no one will build transmission (no reason given) and that regulators need to be involved.
b.	Rogers' (of Merrill Lynch) most notable comments came as an answer to a question when he stated there are three major issues that are affecting infrastructure investment transactions - California, the downturn in the economy, and ENRON.
c.	Uspenski from Schwab told the regulators "Don't get Enron'd".  That if something presented to you doesn't seem to make sense then it doesn't and they should investigate further.
d.	Miller from JP Morgan also mentioned Enron several times in the same context as the others.

Hoatson, Robinson, Staines, Connor     

Please arrange a call in # for 4pm Thursday.

We are trying to identify assets and contracted positions that Enron will either own or control in ERCOT to process the PUCT merger analysis.

If you have any information on existing or planned assets or positions please let me know.  If you want to discuss, please feel free to call me at 3x7673.

Thanks.

Jim

I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  

The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?
  
Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?  
Do we have any construction in progress?  
Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?

Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?

Thanks,

Jim

Thanks.

Earlier this year, Enron filed an application for a Presidential Permit to build a 300 MW HVDC tie between Ercot and Mexico in the Brownsville area. The Permit has not yet been issued.

If the Permit is issued (as we expect), then the earliest construction could start would be sometime in the first quarter of next year.

I you need any further information, please let me know.

Attached is a summary of PG&E's notes on how they calculate the PX Credit (until January 19, 2001 when they hardwired $150/mwh).  We continue to try and get a handle on how the FERC Refund case will impact the PX Credit and Negative CTC.  If anyone has any issues or comments, please let me know.  

Thanks.

Jim

 

I put it together from notes on the PG&E web site.  I may ask Roger to review.

Jim

where did you get this?  From Roger?

Gloria --

Before we move forward, please talk with Steve Montovano.

Thanks.

GPU Energy has requested that EES provide an updated Third Party Supplier agreement as approved by the NJ Board of Public Utilities.
EES currently has financial customers behind GPU. Physical delivery is not projected to commence until 2003. I and Will 
Frederking have reviewed the TPS Agreement and identified some issues that will require the attention and sign-off of the
business units. Relevant business issues include:
1. Credit worthiness standards - EES to provide security equal to 60 days of customer summer usage
2. Taxes - EES to collect and remit all taxes related to electricity sales 
3. Limitation of Liability - EES must insure that any T & D failure including disconnections, curtailment, interruption or reduction of service, is a force majeure event in our contracts, 
4. Billing  - EES is precluded from raising billing disputes, 20 days after the invoice due date 
5. Assignment - GPU consent is required before any assignment by EES
The attached memo sets out these and other issues in more detail. Please note that EES has a similar agreement with Public Service Electric
& Gas Company of New Jersey. Because these agreements are filed with the BPU, and apply to all NJ utilities, GPU resists any attempt 
to propose amendments. Please review and advise by noon tomorrow if you'll approve executing the document as is.

Jean,

Just a reminder that the ERCOT registration deadline is 11/16th. Please indicate how you want to handle.

Many thanks,
Gloria

Jean, 

I have received a request to register EES and EPMI as members of ERCOT's board for 2002.
The deadline is 11/16th. The applicable fees are $2,000 for EPMI (Corporate level), and $500
for EES (Associate level). I have the relevant forms. Let me know if you are handling that from 
Austin or how you want to proceed. Also, who will need to cut the checks ?

Thanks,
Gloria

Great.  I briefly looked at your papers - the idea is very promising if you can find the agency/government.

Jim

Jim, thanks for the lead on Governing Magazine.  Their online website is a

Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to "collect" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

Jim

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable "HC" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its "Est RT$".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the "HC" or  "Est RT$"  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

Alan --

The only way to collect the "overpayment" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.

Jim

I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.  If PG&E reduces going-forward procurement costs to reflect FERC-ordered refunds, I do not understand why it would affect already-issued CTC charges.  The cost of power would be cheaper going forward.

Thanks.  Once done, let's have a phone call with the wholesale electricity team to discuss before sending to Ashley.  

Jim

Jim
I am working on the questions for Ashley Brown. I should have a draft tomorrow, to be checked by Paul.

In the meantime:

1) I am examining the currrent NGC system operator price control and incentive schemes under NETA. It is a radical change from the previous regulation. I would say it is a sophisticated piece of PBR. It includes penalties and incentives on internal and external costs (e.g. balancing) This document clearly states that the system would move away from central, merit order dispatch and would become much more self-dispatched. As a ramification, T rights would be defined on a pnysical basis. (far from our LMP, physical rights model). Your suspicion about NG proposal was right on targed

2) As part of the definition of Profit-RTO (which I think lends itself to multiple interpretations), I prepared this simple graph. In one of the questions we shoud ask Ashley where do they see themselves in the end-state. My feeling is that the Southeast Mediation Report advocated for stage II, NGC is stage III and the "textbook" RTO is stage IV.

 << File: LM-Chart-1001.ppt >> 

Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E).  I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC "overpayment".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC "overpayment"?  

On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the "overpayment" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.

Jim

After 3/31/02, the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit, no?  So a customer's CTC payments should not be affected by refunds. 

If refunds are distributed prospectively, we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PG&E's expected refunds, divide it by total load, and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount.  This is more akin to a lower shopping credit than a higher CTC.

Lisa -

Something to think about.  Do we want to try and expand the issues to resolve the Settlement?

Jim

Leslie, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

Thanks, BT 

Steffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.  Maybe this is already being done, but if not, it is a thought.  Lisa Mellencamp and Michael Tribolet are doing the bankruptcy case. 

Rebecca --

Pls work through Gloria and Bevin Hunter (in Austin).  My understanding is that PUCT filing deadlines are always 3pm, but Bevin can take it over to the PUCT this evening.

I assume that you will create the report and Gloria will draft a simple cover sheet filing. Gloria, we may need Marianne Carroll to sign??

Jim

Jim,

We have to file a report  under project 22834 - pilot reporting in Texas today.  The data will be available at 4PM. Who on your team can I coordinate with to submit the actual filing?

The procedure to submit the filing can be located on the Texas PUC website   http://www.puc.state.tx.us/   left-hand side, filings.

Thanks in advance,
Rebecca

Bob Frank will be coordinating with Services from Govt Affairs.

JIm

Marianne,

I received your faxes. Thank you. I think the right person to contact on filing the Commission Order will be Rebecca Fite. Her group is responsible for license related EES filings. As the filing is past due, it may make sense to send fax copies to the parties today prior to filing.

Thanks,
Gloria

Jim:  FYI -- I spoke with Craig Shields (who replaced Beth Goodman on license application preparation) and he was aware of a "letter" that was sent to the VA commission requesting that our gas pilot license be converted to a permanent gas supply license.  He said "someone here reviewed it" and that it was "very short."  I have asked for a copy of what was sent.  I'll keep you posted... MLC

FULLY AGREE.

Show them now.
RAC asked me to meet them on Nov. 26 to discuss about TGS regulatory risk. 
I wonder if you still want me to hide the results of my report.
Guille

Thanks for the tip.  Why don't we try to have lunch in early December - I'm going to try and take off the week after Thanksgiving.

Jim

Hi Jim -
I sent Mari an email at home about a position that came up here.  We just
had a guy in our regulatory group leave - his position is much below
anything that you would consider, but given the vacancy, they may be able
to create a higher level position for you.  At this point I am really just
seeing if you would even consider talking to our folks and I haven't
presented it to anyone over here either.  Just thought I would bring it up
considering the situation over there.  If you have some interest maybe we
could set up lunch sometime soon.
By the way congrats on the baby.  Maybe it will be a boy this time.

Ray --

Let' s hold a call in early Dec (I don't need to be on the call) where we go through the FERC case for Belden.  Give me a call to discuss.

Jim

I intend to produce this monthly.  We had been doing it before.  If you have any questions about the matters included, please call.

Jim

First time I think I have received this - is this a regular report?

Attached please find Sept's Government Affairs report.

If you would like to discuss, please let me know. 

Thanks,

Jim

thanks

Bevin,

Please file the attached at the Commission.

 << File: Pilot Filing.doc >> 
Rebecca/Nancy,

I did not file the Commission template as an attachment because I do not think that is necessary. Also, the filing outlining the customer classes and their meter classifications is not required by the Commission, and is competitive information. In the attached, I indicated the class of customer that we served during the pilot, and number of customers. That will suffice to meet our rule obligations. Please call with any questions.

Many thanks,
Gloria

Enron would be willing to move forward with the Boston Pacific study (at the $15k) level.

Thanks,

Well.  Haven't they got themselves in a pickle?

Jim

Amr and I met with Dale Furrow and Misty Barrett (Wade Stubblefield's group).  Arthur Andersen again wants our independent review of regulatory assumptions for their year end signoff.  We will do top 50 companies in very incremental fashion - look at changes to assumptions using Stella's tables and then meet with Andersen to give results.  Amr will coordinate compiling of  information.

Interesting quote from Dale - right now, Duke position is his number 1 headache.

Thanks.

Ken Lay called Rick Buy and I up to his office talk about settlement just now.   He would like to settle for liquidity/good news.   Rick Buy is going to discuss with Whalley.

	
Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5

If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.   

 << File: m011116.xls >> 

Before we take this on, let's talk about how it fits into our priorities.  What will be happening that we must cover?

Jim

Ray,

I will be happy to attend the WSCC BOT meeting in December.  I spoke to Steve about the issues to be covered, so we should be all set.  I will contact WSCC and register next week.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Dave, Steve and I talked and due to our schedules and distance from Phoenix, we think it would be most effective if you could represent the company at this BOT meeting.  This is assuming your schedule allows and Jim is on board with one of us attending.  It will be an important meeting with approval of WECC and next year's budget on the agenda.  I am making hotel reservations for you, since today is the deadline.  I think you also need to fill out a form for WSCC; Jenny Remington is the meeting planner.  I will send Dennis Eyre a delegation after I hear from you and Jim.  Ray

I am planning on calling in from home.  Do we have a list of issues/states that we want EPSA to focus on?

If you send me your thoughts, I think that we can send to EPSA before the phone call.

My list -

1.	Florida Wholesale (EWG w/o CCN)
2.	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale"
3.	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs
4.	Re-instate Direct Access in California.

Many EPSA members (led by Williams) will fight against direct access.  I won't push hard here.

DATE:	November 19, 2001

RE:	EPSA State Issues & Public Affairs Action Plan for 2002	Conference Call on Friday, November 30th at 11:00 a.m. (EST)

On Friday, November 30, 2001 at 11:00 a.m. (EST), the Public Affairs and State Issues Committees will hold a conference call to begin discussions regarding specific public affairs actions to be taken by EPSA to support state restructuring efforts, as well as the development of merchant power plant projects nationwide.  During the conference call, we will formulate a preliminary list of states and/or regions for EPSA to target during our initial efforts for 2002.

To access this call dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the EPSA/Samantha Slater Call.   If you have any questions or concerns, or cannot participate on the conference call, please call Mark Stultz or Samantha Slater at EPSA (202-628-8200) prior to November 30th.

Ok.  I agree.  

Jim

Jim,

	WSCC is voting on the formation of the WECC which will consolidated WSCC with the Western Regional Transmission Association and the Southwest Regional Transmission Association.  The Northwest Regional Transmission Association is likely to follow.  In order for this proposal to pass, 85% of the members must vote in favor and 90% of the control area MWs.  I think we should be there to vote for approval of the proposal.  In addition to combining the three (and possibly four) organizations, the change will alter the board make up, bringing independent members onto the board and allowing more latitude in membership.  The committees will be reevaluated as well and restructured over then next 2-3 years.

	Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board, so I talked to him about coverage.  He seemed to be uncertain about his availability.  I have an RTO West Congestion Management Meeting, where we are closing in on the final details of a financial rights model based on nodal pricing in real time.  I think I need to be there to keep the thing from getting fouled up.  Dave is close in Phoenix, so that was the reason that we tentatively made a reservation for him at the hotel.

Here are my thoughts --

1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.
2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.
3.	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).
4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption.
5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.
6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.
7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.

I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?

Jim

Attached for your initial review are Enron Corp. comments on the Marketing Affiliate NOPR (RM01-10).   As you will see, this is an incomplete, bare bones version and we can enhance the arguments once it is clear we all agree with them.  Leslie has struggled mightily with this in light of the constant changes that have been going on and we are sure more changes will be necessary.

Comments must be filed at FERC by December 20.  In order to allow adequate time for a couple of redrafts and the concomitant reviews along with the other things that are going on, please advise me or Leslie of any suggestions, concerns or comments you have by COB MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26th.

Can we talk this week on our response?

Jim

On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for
implementing the suspension of direct access.  Parties have until,
Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.

The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek
Commission approval:

1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP
List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.

2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service
Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,
they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,
2001.

3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer
account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party
verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.

4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place
on or before Sept. 20th.

5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.

6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still
under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to
process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.

7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a
merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;
requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if
the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.

8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a
customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).

9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights
to another.

10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a
community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be
allowed.

In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for
implementing the suspension.

1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and
accepted).

2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should
require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off
to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the
Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to
receive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay
from the Commission.

3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was
associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set
forth a proposed affidavit.)

I'd like to let Bryan take over this project.

Jim

Elizabeth - 
	Jim and I have been discussing the creation of a database where he/we could regularly check the former, current, and prospective projects of those in Government Affairs.  It would be a way to check the on goings in ENA, EES, and GA as a group.  It would also be an effective tool whenever we needed a GA valuation.  When you have a moment, I would like to explain the project to you and get your input as to how we could design the best system.  Please let me know when you have a chance to talk.

Thank you,

Bryan

Does EPSA agree that FERC should require all Transmission Providers should agree to an RTO of the FERC's choosing or lose MBR for all affiliates?  That's the other message Lynne should put out.

Jim

I sat in on the EPSA call on market based rates on Friday.  As you know, the Commission has on its agenda for tomorrow a new proceeding entitled "Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations" (presumably being done under the Commission's section 206 authorization).  EPSA realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the Commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for Lynn Church to release if, after seeing what the Commission has in mind, the investigation will apply to all holders of market based rates.  The press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and (assuming the Commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists.

I have a call in to EPSA to see if I can get any more details about what the press release will say.  Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for the press release.   I'll let everyone know what comes out of the FERC meeting as soon as I find out.

EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  

There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.

If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Jim

Harry --

I think that we need to talk with EWS Tariff risk to make sure that we are on the same page.  I am concerned that some of Gloria's statements may not end up happening with the final tariffs.

Please advise.

Jim

Bob,

Per Section 25.345 (c) of the Electric rules, if the Cogen facility has a rated capacity of 10MW or less, it qualifies as "eligible generation" under Section 25.345(c)(B). In Section 25.345(i), an end-user whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation and who does not receive any electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities of a T & D utility is not responsible for payment of any stranded cost charges.  

Also a retail customer whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation who also receives electrical service that require the delivery of power through the facilities of a T & D utility, shall be responsible for payment of stranded costs charges based solely on the services that are actually provided by the T & D utility.

The short answers to your questions are:
1. Rock Tenn will not be required to pay CTC charges if its rated output is less than 10MW, and it does not take any T&D services from TXU.
2. If Rock Tenn uses T&D facilities occasionally, it will pay CTC only for the actual services it receives from the T& D utility. 
3. If Rock Tenn completely disconnects from the utilities T&D services, it will be in the same position as in 1 above. It will not be required to pay the CTC.
4. At this time, TXU does not have a financing bond issued by the Commission. In an earlier order, the Commission approved $363 MM for TXU, but that order was appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for rehearing. With information that is available to it at this time, the Commission does not think that TXU has stranded costs. I believe TXU will disagree. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria
Gloria,

Per the information you provided Trish (below) concerning CTC in TX, the cogen design is less than 10MW. Therefore, what are the "DG rules" and how do these rules impact Rock Tenn's requirement to pay CTC? What if they only use the utility's T&D facilities occasionally when the cogen is not running? What if they completely disconnect from the utility's T&D facilities, as if they are no longer in business? Is TXU expected to have significant stranded costs?

Thanks, Bob

Here is the information for Rock Tenn.

Thanks,

Trish

Trish, I sent this to you yesterday, but apparently, it went to the wrong address.

Trish,

Per Chapter 39.252(b)(1) of the Texas Utilities Code, recovery of stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers within the utility's certificated territory as it existed on May 1, 1999. A retail customer may not avoid CTC's by switching to a new on-site generation. New on-site generation is defined as an electric generator generating more than 10 MW, capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of the utility T & D facilities, and which was not fully operational prior to 12/31/99. (If the self-gen facility's output is 10 MW or less, it will be governed by the DG  rules.)

If a customer commences taking energy from a new on-site generation (with output of more than10 MW ) which materially reduces or eliminates the customer's use of energy delivered through the utility's facilities, the customer shall pay an amount each month computed by multiplying the output of the on-site generation by the CTC which is in effect during the month.

Any CTC assessed on such a self -gen facility after it becomes fully operational, shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with services actually provided by the T & D utility to the customer after the facility has become fully operational. So if no services actually provided, there should be no payment.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

I'll call Ashley and relay the message.

Jim

Mike, 

I agree with your sentiments.....

Kerry/Susan, what are your thoughts?  I think it would be a good move as it delays implementation of ARTO which gives the MISO further time to develop its day 2 protocols...the only downside is NG response (Jim could you talk to Ashley as discussed and let him know that we haven't had time to respond adequately on this filing).

regards
Mike

We have been invited to sign on to a request for extension of time in the Alliance/National Grid docket.  Please respond directly to Patrick Groomes and copy me......thanks

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Jim

 

 

 

Can you  forward  both org. charts to me together?

I will get with Evan and his team and pull this together.  Of course, much of the activity with Utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements (which change over time).

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Ray --

I assume this makes sense and you are incorporating into the case?

Jim
Richard,

Here are a few comments on the CalPX letter to FERC outlining the difficulties in calculating PX refunds.  

1.  The PX claims it is a "neutral party in this proceeding" and is only a conduit for cash.  True for PX business, not true for CAISO obligations.  The CAISO holds SC's responsible for non-payment, not the SC's customers.  The PX was the SC for most of the transactions going through the day-ahead and hour-ahead market.  Therefore, the PX is primarily liable.  I'm not sure how this helps us, though, since the PX has no money.  

2.  Page 3, SC Data.  I was unaware that the CalPX acted as SC until February 28th---one month after it closed the doors on January 31st.  During this time, the CAISO was probably in violation of its Tariff, which requires SCs to be creditworthy.

3.  Page 5.  Commandeered contracts.  What is the status of the PX's claim against the State of California?  The State owes the PX, as representative for its Participants, the mark-to-market value of the contracts on January 31st, less amounts paid by CDWR to suppliers.  If the PX won't bring this claim, its bankruptcy trustee or the PX Participants should bring this claim against the State of Califonria.

4.  Pages 3 and 4.  $150 Breakpoint.  I asked Kit Blair in Volume Management to review this letter and he said that it was his view and the view of two other folks in VM that the PX is vastly overstating the difficulty in calculating the $150 breakpoint.  His view was that it should take hours or days, but not weeks.  However, I do not see how we get an advantage from accelerating the calculation of refunds.

Finally, according to reports from Credit and VM, the remaining PX employees are not exactly the "A-team."   I suggest we should ask FERC to require the PX to document its methodology for calculating refunds, so that we can review for errors.  Spot audits by independent auditors might be a good idea, too.

I'll ask around floor.  Given my background, this position does not sound like the best fit - I'd rather be more on the long-term contracting (origination) side or business development.  Thanks for the inquiry.  

As you know, things are pretty crazy right now here at Enron.  I intend to take the week off after Thanksgiving and intend to give you a call during that period.  Have a great Thanksgiving.

Jim

Update on the MD EEMC license issue - 

We talked to both Accounting and Resource Planning Staff at the MD Commission and they indicate the remaining outstanding item is a request for an unlimited, unconditional, unrestricted parental guarantee.  Suppliers have been unwilling to provide such a guarantee.  The Commission has been approving these requests for licenses on a 90 day, provisional basis, pending a later determination of how or if they will modify the parental guarantee requirement. 

We will go forward with trying to get this provisional approval tomorrow and then address the guarantee requirements as they become known.

EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  

There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.

If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

 
EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Jim-

I want to thank you for taking some time to speak with me this morning about my current position relative to Enron's market position.  More importantly, I want to thank you for your candor and honesty.  I walked away from the meeting feeling elated and confident, regardless of the bleak message.   

I only wish you the best of luck these next few weeks.  You are in a tough position, a position I do not envy.  I am heeding your advice and looking for opportunities outside this organization.  I had hoped to work in your group as an associate rotation.  I am certain that I could have learned a great deal from you and parlayed it into opportunities for this organization.  Maybe our paths will cross in the future. 

If there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to contact me.  My cell phone number is 713.444.8282 and work extension is 51793.  

Yours Sincerely,

Amanda Day

Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "Adequate Assurances of Payment", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.

6.	Appendicies:
a.	Form of transport contract
b.	Gas flows in Texas

Diann --

I was under the impression that we had taken all necessary steps to protect our customers?  Is this problem just related to residential customers?

Jim

All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent.   

Please do.  We could discuss on the regular NERC call at 2:30 Tuesdays.

Jim

Jim--I think this is the meeting (that I couldn't open the agenda).  I would think Jose could cover, but worth having a brief conference call next week.  Want me to set it up?

Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA members in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a wholesale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri.

Friends--

Whatever the coming days or weeks may bring, I wanted to make sure we could stay in touch.

Here's a web page with my contact information and a place for you to type in yours, if you wish: http://www.blr.net/friends/   

Feel free to pass this email along to anyone you think appropriate.  Thanks!

Brandon

Ashley --

First, hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday.  

Luiz Maurer and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier.  If you have any questions, please call me.

Also, Enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).  Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at Enron we needed more time to respond.  Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.

Thanks,

Jim

=============================

1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ? Stage III? Stage IV?

 

2) Regarding document "Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive 
consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?

3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other
negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?

4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?

5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?

6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?

7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model] 

8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. Don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?

9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?

10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?

11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?

12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?

13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models

Nice to meet your brother.  Do you have a map of the 25th?

Jim

Yes this gets at my issues.  I want to build your matrix and Rebecca's together.  No where do we deal with reporting yet?  Also, we need to have some systematic approach to updates and naming "point people".

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

Jim

Christi --

I'm out next week.  

This is a bit touchy with the changes coming.  Why not have Jose agree to go  (no one else) and if necessary we'll backfill.

Jim

I am planning to attend this meeting and maintain the dialog with the organizations- EPSA, NERC, EISB, 

Jose

Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA members in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a wholesale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri.

My thoughts --

1.	Great job.
2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  
3.	Thanks for getting in "Network Plus" - it's the little things that matter.
4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.

Thanks.

Attached are draft RTO comments.  The comments reflect EPMI's views on RTO development, given the Commission's apparent recent changes in position on the number of RTOs to be created.  We urge Right Sized RTOs without choosing a number.  

The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.

I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please "Reply to All" so everyone receives your comments.  

Thanks for everyone's help.

Susan:  we should also have Kevin review the comments

Alan:  Tim should probably review the comments as well, but check with Dave and Steve to see if the "LMP in the West" argument is correct before you show him the comments.

Sarah

 << File: Comments on RTO Week -- Revised.doc >> 

LUIZ --  Attached is a version that I changed.  Mainly formattting the intro.  I think that our current draft is too long without a short synopsis up front. We want a White Paper that reads like an advocacy piece.  Please add to whatever you are doing.  Also, move forward with contacting Larry Ruff for (1) his analysis of your and my combined draft and (2) a simple affadavit on this.  Govt Affairs will pay up to $10k for this work out of our current budget.  We need to have this finished by Tuesday EOB.  

CHARLES -- We need to make sure that Monday and Tuesday someone calls everyone on the Committee considering changing these rules on Thursday.  Let's get the list and start lobbying actively.  Call me if you have any questions.  Please talk with Doug Gilbert-Smith about who and where.  Maybe Christi and Jean Ryall can help.

CHRISTI -- Pls make sure that Steve Walton and Sarah Novosel are ok with this statements.

Thanks.

Jim 

We need to be very cautious about signing on to documents that seek to delay the start date of any RTO - unless and until I hear something different from FERC, my going in assumption is that Enron will be one of the only voices on this issue.  We should only give on this issue when real value is being created. 

Why not file a "me too" on the issue of seating of the Board w/o agreeing to everything else?

Jim

Kerry -- 
I think this looks fine.  Please ask Mike and see if Donna thinks this is fine (Donna -- What effect would this groups asking for the 12/15 start date to be pushed back have on AEP's merger?)

Kevin is ok with Enron signing on to this, even if the start date is pushed back some.

FYI to all -- Please remember to include Donna and Sarah on issues dealing with FERC.  Thanks.

We have an opportunity to join in sponsoring the attached pleading by Virginia Commission et al.  The pleading protests Alliances' interim independent board proposal included in its 8/27 compliance filing as non-compliant with FERC's 7/12 Alliance Order and with Order 2000, asserts that its 8/27 compliance filing should be rejected in-part (the exception being that portion of the filing addressing permanent governance) since it was not reviewed by a permanent independent board, and requests suspension of any further decision-making by the Alliance members.  We should definitely consider joining in this protest, but need to act today.

FYI (see message below).  Please advise if you or your organization is
interested in joining in sponsoring this pleading and if you have any
suggested changes. 

 <<82701protest.doc>> Attached for your review and consideration is a draft
"Motion to Reject, Protest, and Further Start-up Activities by the Alliance
Companies of The Virginia State Corporation Commission". 
We have opted not to file a complaint and have choosen the abovce approach.
While a motion for stay is traditionally only filed when a party seeks to
stay an agency order, in this instance we thought it would be appropriate to
request that the Commission "stay" the Alliance Companies' RTO-related
start-up activities, pending implementation of an independent board.  Given
the new chair's interest in competitive markets, we think there is nothing
to lose with this approach, and we believe making the arguments in the
context of the requirements for a stay may emphasize the critical nature of
the request.
I have been informed that 8 of the 10 Alliance Companies have signed a
letter of intent to enter into negotiations for National Grid to become the
managing member. The interim governance proposal is "pretty close" to the
Tuesday's Alliance Company proposal.
The draft anticipates that the Alliance Companies will put forth a interim
governance similar to what they put forward last Tuesday.  We will, of
course, have to make adjustments after we have actually seen the filing.
We look forward to receiving your input.

Not sure if there is much to do.  I was just sending this e-mail because I saw Alan working to find a copy as well as John Shelk's team - wanted to make sure we weren't duplicating efforts.

Jim

Jim:

What role do you perceive Alan and I should have on this issue?  It seems like the CFA report may help us on the native load issue but it doesn't add much to our effortsr re: one-RTO issue.

Alan & Paul --

See John Shelk's e-mail below.  Alan, you may want to coordinate.

Jim

Carin attended today's CFA press conference in which Mark Cooper released an electricity report.  Below is Carin's very helpful and well done summary of the report together with links to the CFA press release and the full report.  While we will sharply disagree with their comments on restructuring results in the states, we should be able to make use of their latest comments on the critical need to separate transmission from generation to avoid discrimination.  We should recruit them for our RTO legislative coalition.

PSE&G called yesterday to ask for an LC or cash collateral of $1.0 MM to displace our Corporate Guarantee of $1.3 MM.  They are sending more information in a letter to Bill Bradford copied to me.  THere is a 5 day turnaround - early next week this will be due.

Yes.  He is now a big-time headhunter.  
 
I hope you had a great Thanskgiving.  Things are crazy here.
 
Jim

JIm--I was reading some clips last week and saw a quote from Lyndon Taylor at Heidrick and Struggles.  Is that our old colleague Lyndon???

Let's talk early next week.

Jim,

I am sorry to bother you and I know that you had OK'ed this just 10 days ago, but in light of recent events I would like to check if it is still OK for my attending this meeting.  As Steve had noted before, this meeting is important from the standpoint of being sure the WECC is formed and our vote is important in  making this happen, however I want to be sure we still feel this is important to our core business before I go.

Thanks,

Dave

Dave and Ray,

	This is an exchange I had with Jim this morning.  Afterward I realized I hadn't replied to all, so I am not correcting that error.

Steve

Ok.  I agree.  

Jim

Jim,

	WSCC is voting on the formation of the WECC which will consolidated WSCC with the Western Regional Transmission Association and the Southwest Regional Transmission Association.  The Northwest Regional Transmission Association is likely to follow.  In order for this proposal to pass, 85% of the members must vote in favor and 90% of the control area MWs.  I think we should be there to vote for approval of the proposal.  In addition to combining the three (and possibly four) organizations, the change will alter the board make up, bringing independent members onto the board and allowing more latitude in membership.  The committees will be reevaluated as well and restructured over then next 2-3 years.

	Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board, so I talked to him about coverage.  He seemed to be uncertain about his availability.  I have an RTO West Congestion Management Meeting, where we are closing in on the final details of a financial rights model based on nodal pricing in real time.  I think I need to be there to keep the thing from getting fouled up.  Dave is close in Phoenix, so that was the reason that we tentatively made a reservation for him at the hotel.

Steve

Before we take this on, let's talk about how it fits into our priorities.  What will be happening that we must cover?

Jim

Ray,

I will be happy to attend the WSCC BOT meeting in December.  I spoke to Steve about the issues to be covered, so we should be all set.  I will contact WSCC and register next week.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Dave, Steve and I talked and due to our schedules and distance from Phoenix, we think it would be most effective if you could represent the company at this BOT meeting.  This is assuming your schedule allows and Jim is on board with one of us attending.  It will be an important meeting with approval of WECC and next year's budget on the agenda.  I am making hotel reservations for you, since today is the deadline.  I think you also need to fill out a form for WSCC; Jenny Remington is the meeting planner.  I will send Dennis Eyre a delegation after I hear from you and Jim.  Ray

FYI

 << File: DEC 2001 ANNOUNCE.doc >> 

See Dave's message below.  You guys have to give me every bit of information that give us as much texture as to the criticalness of any payment coming out of your area.  We are having to clear EVERY payment through a central ENE clearing led by George Wasaff.  We have to describe in as much detail as possible why any payment made preserves value to the company.

Thanks for all your help and sorry this is so detailed.

Wade
Wade, you need to give George and Ray more texture ie) we lose $30M in value - in active sale mode that looks promising and we buy Enron ten days with New York ISO.

Jim,

As decisions are pending regarding our existing customer base, Evan Hughes has asked me to send the following information to you.

Since Enron has had a material change in our financial standing, it is our obligation to notify the Commission of our status and intent within 10 days. 

Please review section from Substantive Rule 25 applicable to Electric Service Providers - 25.107 ( i ) 3, b -  Requirements for reporting and for changing the terms of a REP certificate.

It sounds better on FM - you can pick up the wonderful vocals.  Didn't hear too much from Rush on the drive - he was probably in a bunker worried that the Taliban was after him.

Jim

I, too, enjoy listening to hillbilly tunes but only on AM radio.  When I am not listening to Rush.

Bob --

We need to pull together the rules, etc. for a change in assignment w/o consent for small commercial in NYC and TX by 3 pm tomorrow (or earlier). Grab me and we can discuss.

Jim

We will need to let everyone know early next week - working on msg

Wade -  Anywhere that we have Supplier Consolidated Billing Enron put up some form of credit to cover 45+ days of Utility charges.  So while I am unsure of the form of collateral, if Evan provides a list of where we are doing Supplier Consolidated Billing, we should be able to construct a Collateral Obligation worksheet.  We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  

It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.  

Jim

My reading of a memo that SCE sent is that we have a deposit requirement of ~$23MM and that it needs to increase.  It wasn't clear whether that deposit was satisfied with cash, bond or LC. In all areas where we are billing our clients for power and T&D, we may have the opportunity to go to dual billing and receive deposits back, as well as to stop funding the PG&E escrow account.  I would imagine that the tariff provides for our deposits only to be netted against a deficiency in our T&D payments, where we are probably 100% current.

We need to aggregate where we think we have this opportunity and take action today.

Thanks - Dan

I am copying a lot of people on here to try and get as many sources thinking about this as possible.  Dan indicated to me that SCE appears to have a sizable deposit from us on hand (around $20MM) and is asking for more.  How can we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits.  I would like to think we have them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet, but that is not likely (although Kim, Cindy and Mary Lynne should scour that).

Does anybody have any ideas?????

Wade

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Christi & Sarah --

Do we have to do something related to this?  Thanks.

Jim

Note also that in a separate development FERC
simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section
206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide.
What this means is that, although only three utilities are
mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC
will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes
to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30
companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to
determine if the commission believes they exert market
power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires
power providers with market-based sales authority to amend
their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with
open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission
determines that market manipulation has occurred.

Did you hear anything on WM?

Julie --

Given our current situation at Enron, I wanted to let you know that we will not be able to support the SE RTO Study.  I assume that you were already thinking this.  This upcoming week should prove to be another amazing ride.

With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.

I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.

While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.  

I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.

For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.

This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.

Jim,
 
This isn't the most appropriate time to be asking for this favor but I was wondering if you would write a letter of recommendation for me for business school.  I've already been accepted to DU's law program but I've recently decided to pursue their joint JD/MBA degree.  So....I need to apply to their business school separately.  
 
Rick wrote a letter for me when I applied to the law school, and I thought you would be a good person to write one for the MBA.
 
I am attaching a form that you can detach and fill out (you can include comments within this form or draft a letter of recommendation and include as an attachment).  When you're finished, I will give you a special envelope that you have to sign and seal.  Return the envelope to me, and I will mail it with the application and other materials directly to the school.
 
Just so you know, I've also asked one of the emission brokers at Cantor Fitzgerald to write a letter and also Greg Woulfe (who I reported to on the Power Desk).   
 
I'm applying to the Univerisity of Denver Daniels College of Business
www.dcb.du.edu <http://www.dcb.du.edu> (if you want more information).
 
I hope you don't mind.  I just need to have it all completed by December 1st.

Chantel  --

Please call me at 713-853-7673 to assist with any questions.

Chantel,

I forwarded your email on.  Today is my last day so you should probably follow up with Jim Steffes. 
Thanks and take care.

Group -
 
I received a call from Greg Carmean, MD PSC Exec.  Director, regarding review of Enron's credit status.  It is Greg's  understanding that the MD IOU's are planning to review Enron's creditworthiness  as an electricity and/or gas supplier.  In the event that the Commission  needs to take any expeditious action in this regard, we need to  know who to contact within your organization.  Please advise as soon  as possible how you would like us to handle this matter.
Thanks,

Jim, thanks for the call this morning.  As promised, I've attached the
executive summary for the C'RM business idea we discussed along with a list
of questions I've been compiling to help me better understand the municipal
government market space

I'll look forward to our Monday meeting.

Thanks,
Dick.

ps--I believe that the answer to the question is that we do not own any units, as we sold the Lincoln Center project last year, but I am not in the know enough about whatever else we might have an ownership interest in to make that determination.

I would recommend that all letters as such should go to Harry and me.  I think we will be getting a number of these.  I would say that we will try and communicate something proactively to the PUCs around the country by Wed am.  Critical that our message is consistent and clear.  Rebecca, any thoughts?

Jim

Hi guys.  Are any of you in the loop on how we're handling this and any other request that comes in?  I'd like to at least be able to respond to Mr. Pregozen on Monday with thoughts on who will be responding and when he can expect a response.   Let me know.  thanks.

Ms. Landwehr,

Pursuant to 83 Ill Adm Code 451.740(a), please see attached letter

Harry --  EES filed yesterday.  My thought is to focus on keeping our licenses so that we can return customers in an orderly fashion.
 
Jim

One thing we need immediate clarification on is, if EES has not filed for bankruptcy yet, does that give the ICC or any other commission, less leeway with regard to stripping licenses. Mike, will EES be filing? 

I would recommend that all letters as such should go to Harry and me.  I think we will be getting a number of these.

Thanks.

Pls hold for inclusion in CPUC letter today.

Jim

Are these the letters you were looking for from me?

   

 

 

 

Thanks.  I've enjoyed working with you and more importantly, getting to know you.  Best of luck going forward.  If you ever need any thing, please don't hesitate to call me.  
 
Jim

I've always thought of each of you as the very core of the Enron I knew.  You interviewed me, you hired me, and ultimately, you made me a part of the best team of people I've ever worked with.  I've learned more in the last five years from you than I could have dreamed of.  You will be missed and thought of often.  I wish the very best for each of you and your families.  
 
Thank you for being my teachers and friends.  
 
Janel

Thanks Becky.  I've truly enjoyed getting to know you better as we've worked closer these past few months.  You've taught me alot about natural gas issues and if I can ever do anything for you please let me know.

You might need this someday.

These reports detail (hopefully) all the interventions, comments, protests we have done since I started doing this.

FYI

The sales agreement provides that we may terminate the sales agreement immediately without any further obligation if we do not receive an allocation of market support generation.

An "event of default" under the sales agreement (e.g. filing of bankruptcy) will automatically establish an "Early Termination Date" and may trigger payment of an "Early Termination Payment".

I have not been able to find the provisions, yet, that would cause rescission of MSG.  I will have to continue that in the morning.

However, as a nonlawyer, an interesting question arises in terms of chicken or the egg.  It seems like it would be better to lose MSG and terminate the contract without any further financial obligation, than to be in default of the contract and pay an Early Termination Payment.  Will continue to research in the morning.

No 
Yeung + Lindberg are gone

In speaking to the PUC today, they are under the impression that we are currently physically serving Compaq and JC Penney.  Is this right? If so, don't we want to deDASR them?

Jim

Joe,

Bob G. is implementing what I tell him to DeDASR.  If you need the "green light" to DeDASR...Dave Delainey gives me the final OK and I'll let Bob G. know what next steps need to happen.

FYI -- so far -- I have directed him to DeDASR ERCOT Lockheed and Package Ice only.

Evan

I talked with Bob Gresch who is doing all over our switches with ERCOT for Lockheed and Packaged Ice.  We need to send him the proper information to DeDASR Owens Corning as well.  We have already given ERCOT the authority to cancel the pending request for Owens, however, we need to send the DeDASR over as well.  

Additionally, ERCOT is going to hold a conference call with EES, TXU and ERCOT to walk through the steps for the drop to POLR (TDSP).  I am going to send Bob Gresch's contact info to them for the call.  If anyone else would like to be included on this call, please let me know.  Thanks.

-Joe

In OH I believe that the MSG service continues (transfers with the customers) so it's just any discount we gave above the MSG rate.

Jim

Below is what Jim put together to generally describe what would happen to our
customer's power prices if they went back to the utility.  Obviously the actual 
economic benefit or detriment of longer term contracts will not be known for
some time :

CA:	worse off
TX:	worse off, but will likely find a similar deal
IL:	worse off
NJ:	better off in the short term, worse off in the long term
OH:	worse off (First Energy)
MA:	some better / some worse
NY:	short term better / long term probably worse
ME:	worse off, but new rates come out in March that may make utility a better choice

Gas:	probably better off   

Lets discuss what we are doing state by state.  I know we can provide power in TX until 12/14
and in NY until 12/9, but I'm unclear on the status of the other states.

Thanks
Peggy

Good news.  Also, Rich Drom called from PJM wanting to know if someone from Enron was attending the Members Mtg this Thursday (no) and if what did we want to do with the confidentiality of our credit (I think that we should agree - not PJM's to distribute).  Your thoughts - I'll call Drom back tomorrow.

Jim

I'm connected again, so please include me in correspondences, etc.  Christi, if you need to me send the note about NEPOOL decertification status, I can do that now.
 
Thanks

Thanks Ann.  Pls send to me going forward (at least as long as we're here).

Hey Jim,

In case you still wanted to read this publication.  I am sending this to you now because I feel if King Publishing wants to sue at this point they can go ahead and make their case with all the others.  Enjoy. A.

Jeff --

Pls call.

Jeff pls call Bryan Gottfredson at 713-942-7307 to discuss possible job openings in CA.

I agree.  In fact, in the conversation with the Chairman of PUCT, I told him that we were sending all of our pilot load back to TXU before Jan 1.

Jim

Anything or anybody that is pending physical delivery or is being physically delivered to by us needs to be DeDASRed.  We do not want any physical positions in ERCOT, pending or otherwise.  Evan has just called me and let me know that we have Continental Pet Technologies, Owens Corning and Owens Illinois that are either pending or being physically served in addition to the Compaq and JC Penny accounts.  Someone has to have documented information on who has been DASRed by EES to this point.  We don't need meetings to make sure we are straight on this.  Whoever we are showing through internal sources, CSC, or the ISO as being physically deliverd to by EES or any subsidiary of Enron Corp, we need to De DASR them.  DEDASR EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING IN ERCOT.  This point should alleviate any confusion going forward on what needs to be done with our ERCOT customers.  

In speaking to the PUC today, they are under the impression that we are currently physically serving Compaq and JC Penney.  Is this right? If so, don't we want to deDASR them?

Just in case you haven't heard.  The storage monetization project died this week.  The storage group is being or has been disbanded because it was unlikely a deal could be closed prior to the end of the year.

Ok.

No.  They should not say what the credit is, simply that we meet the collateral standard (per the Enron lawyers).

Good news.  Also, Rich Drom called from PJM wanting to know if someone from Enron was attending the Members Mtg this Thursday (no) and if what did we want to do with the confidentiality of our credit (I think that we should agree - not PJM's to distribute).

Hey there Jim.  I'm glad you made it back in one piece.  I'm sure your wife=
 was frantic. =20

FYI:  This past week-end, Becky and I attended NESA's annual conference.  O=
ne of the highlights was a panel entitled "Power Deregulation."  On the pan=
el:  Brad Williams, Sr. VP, Entergy Wholesale Operations;  Michael Schneide=
r, Director, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E); Steve Gillialand, Sr. VP, Du=
ke Energy North America, LLC; and Jerry Winter, VP, Reliant Energy Services=
.  Note: Loretta Lynch, President, CPUC was scheduled to participate on the=
 panel as well, but she was a no-show.  My guess - she chickened out.  It w=
as probably for the best because everyone on the panel "slammed" California=
, the Governor, and the CPUC.

I had the opportunity of questioning Michael Schneider (I asked these via n=
ote cards) of SDG&E in regards to Open Access and where did it look like th=
e legislature was going with it and what was SDG&E's position.  On record, =
he said that open access will pass through legislature but that it would be=
 "segmented."  For example, depending on the size of the customer would dep=
end on if they can participate in regards to open access.  The Large custom=
ers can have the opportunity to participate in open access but supposedly b=
ecause the smaller customers "aren't really educated" on the issues of open=
 access, they won't be able to participate.  (Sounded rather patronizing to=
 me, even if he was rather pleasant.)  How does SDG&E feel about open acces=
s?  He said that they're definitely in favor of  open access and feel that =
it is needed but only for large customers and that the smaller customers ar=
en't "quite ready" for open access because again lack of education.  Suppos=
edly the smaller customers aren't sophisticated enough I guess.

Jim, question - is this something everyone on the Ca. calls already know in=
cluding you or should I send this out to others as a "FYI" ?

Melinda

Christi --

Who in ENA leadership could we talk with about finding a "champion" for Gus Engheim (environmental permitting), Bob Frank and Harry Kingerski?  Steve Kean is talking to Ben Jacoby about Gus.  Who else - maybe Scott Neal on gas for Harry Kingerski and Bob Frank?

Let me know.

As we discussed  today, PJM will be disclosing the attached statement at the PJM Energy Markets  Committee meeting in Wilmington, DE this afternoon.
 
I look forward to  receiving from you a formal notification that you have become Enron's PJM  Members Committee representative and also providing me with a name and address  to forward the November 2001 PJM bill.
 
Thanks.

Diann --

So it is correct to say that EES is responsible for the final bills?  If yes, how much $$ is this?

Jim

I understand now.  Thanks.

The customer is not entitled to the credits.  The credits were transferred, then final DA bills calculated and transferred to the customer.  The customer is NOT responsible for these final bills.  Had PG&E not transferred the Enron credits, the final debit bills would have been taken against the credits.

I am a little confused.  Why would the customers be entitled to a credit on bundled service?  EES owns the credits.

Jim,  as far as we know, PG&E is doing this on residential accounts only.  Remember that residential contracts were terminated in May and all accounts returned to utility service.  Instead of using the accumulated credits to clear the final direct access bills, PG&E transferred the credits, then calculated the final amounts.  These debits were then transferred to the customers PG&E bills.  These accounts were NOT reDASRed, so they are no longer Enron customers.  

I have requested a list of all credits transferred from Enron residential customers accounts, plus a listing of direct access bills transferred to these customers.  In the meantime, I feel we need to submit a formal request.

Diann --

I was under the impression that we had taken all necessary steps to protect our customers?  Is this problem just related to residential customers?

Jim

All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent.   

yes.  also there is one at www.1400smith.com that I helped set up.

Mr. Steffes,

Your email was forwarded to me from Rick Drom that you will be replacing Tom
Hoatson as the primary representative on the Members Committee.  Has Mr. Hoatson
left Enron?  Are you replacing him on all PJM related committees?  Our database
shows that he is also a member on the following committees:
Energy Market Committee
Planning Committee
Tariff Advisory Committee
Reliability Committee
Transmission Owners Agreement - Administrative Committee
MEN Study Committee
Credit User Group

I will correct / update the Members Committee roster and wait to hear back from
you with respect to the other committees.  Thank you.

Comnes	$0 (started late last year)			50,000
Walton		$65,000					50,000
Yeung		$36,000					40,000
Lindberg	$20,000						40,000
Frank		$55,000					40,000

Can we talk tomorrow to finalize?  Pls give me a good time.

Jim

Jim -

The following people have already received something.

Dasovich

Here is the information for the others.

Montovano	$108,000
Comnes	$0 (started late last year)
Walton		$65,000
Yeung		$36,000
Lindberg	$20,000
Frank		$55,000

Thanks for your help on this!

Amy

Amr --

Hope things are well.  I saw a notice for a meeting on Caribbean Energy Jan 31, 2002 in Miami by CBI.  The information is at www.cbiglobalenergy.com.  Thought maybe you'd want to go and flash yourself around.

Take care,

Jim

I don't have her number but call San DIego and ask for Sempra.

Call Greg Sharp

Cpuc sent ltr on switching - I'll fax

I don't know Aldie Warnock.  Thanks for the idea, but I'm going to try and get out of the regulatory world.  Might as well try my hand making $.

I know John Orr and John Meyer.  Not sure about going back to the traveling of RTO world.  Let me think on it.

Let's still do lunch sometime next week.

Thanks.

Jim

Hey Jim,
Thanks for the phone call.  Do you know Aldie Warnock?  He is kind of like
our political whip over here.
Subsequent to this email below, he told me that he was looking for someone
who could serve as a regulatory/FERC advisor to the trade floor - right up
your alley.  He asked me if I knew anyone and I suggested you and gave your
background as an Enron big shot.  He either knew you or knew of you and
said that he wasn't interested.  I really couldn't figure it out, and I
told him I thought the world of you (that may have actually been a negative
though).  I think that he was interviewing a girl from your shop for the
position was her name Christi Nicholae (sp?).  I share this in complete
confidence with you.
So, if you are still interested in talking to us, I would like to set up
lunch with John Orr.  He is an atty who handles most of the RTOs and some
FERC stuff.  John reports to John Meyer if you know him.  He is looking for
someone, but you would be way over qualified.  But, as I suggested before
maybe he could reevaluate what kind of individual he is looking for given
your qualifications.
Let me know what you want to do.

                    David T
Hi Jim -
I sent Mari an email at home about a position that came up here.  We just
had a guy in our regulatory group leave - his position is much below
anything that you would consider, but given the vacancy, they may be able
to create a higher level position for you.  At this point I am really just
seeing if you would even consider talking to our folks and I haven't
presented it to anyone over here either.  Just thought I would bring it up
considering the situation over there.  If you have some interest maybe we
could set up lunch sometime soon.
By the way congrats on the baby.  Maybe it will be a boy this time.

Thanks

Anthony & Evan --

Who should process this?

Jim

FYI.  Note that we even had a meeting which included EES on 9/5 where the responsible party (Kelly Lovvorn) committed to certain tasks, which he obviously did not perform.  (Kelly is a contract employee.)  

Jim - there will be a charge (probably significant, especially for the "emergency" processing) from CSC to produce the required information.  There is some expectation that Government Affairs should be paying for it, especially since it will be a recurring item for several months.  Who should I go to to resolve this?

Unfortunately, no action was ever taken nor followed through on this request originally initiated 8/14/01, which has now 
put EES in a bind.  Suzanne Calcagno and I have decided to take ownership and will coordinate with Brenda Herod 
and CSC.

We're in the process of writing system specifications and will forward an "emergency" request for data to Brenda and CSC
this afternoon.   

Becky Cantrell will submit a request for an extension to FERC as soon as we determine how quickly CSC can produce the
information required.

Please note, no further action from any other group will be required.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Donna Corrigan Greif
713/853-9517

Suzanne,

Please be advised that Kelly Lovvorn (x5-8997) will coordinate the FERC data requirements with IT personnel for the EES Systems.
I passed on all the details regarding data specifications and a high level overview of ENAs plan.

The EES data will need to be pulled from all Settlement applications which include HP9000, STAT, and Altra.  Kelly does
have a few programming resources available in house, yet he may need to request the information from CSC.  If that is the
case, there will be costs associated with the data pull and it will be much more difficult to validate the data.  In addition, there
may also be timing issues (????)....

I have asked Kelly to coordinate directly with you as he has questions/concerns.  You may want to check back with him in a few days to
workout target dates for your team to actually receive the information, who he should forward info to, etc...

Thanks,

dg

(note:  Just as an "extra" thought....as long as we Settle out of Altra/HP/Stat, all FERC data 
 requests (involving pricing w/ volumetric actuals) will need to come from those systems.)

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =

TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.

4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.

5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.

6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.

Jim

Thanks Marianne.  We've been in contact with the PUC but we will need some help next week.  Are you in Monday?

Jim

FYI.  The PUC's rule under which Enron Energy Sservices was certified as an
REP in Texas requires that a REP notify the Commission of any petition in
bankruptcy within 10 days of the filing.  In addition, 10-day notification
is required for any material change in the financial requirements presented
by a REP pursuant to which its application for REP certification was
approved.  A REP has 30 days to notify the Commission of any change in the
technical conditions presented in its application.  Finally, a REP may not
cease operations as a REP without prior notice to the Commission, as well as
to customers and any other affected persons (such as the T&D utility, etc.).

Please let me know if we can assist Enron in any of these filings, and give
me a call if you have any questions.  The relevant rule governing these
requirements is PUC Substantive Rule 25.107.

I don't know of any EES collateral at PJM.  Very small position in PECO territory.  
 
Jim

I can check with PJM, if necessary, unless there is someone else at EES that may know of the collateral situation.  Thanks.

I don't have any knowledge of EES or EEMC posting collateral.  

Ed--Does EES or EEMC have collateral at PJM?  Is it $0?  Thanks.  Christi

Angela --

To follow up on our discusion about TX customers (e.g., Home Depot), are there any other customers that you are going to include in the sales effort (not including CA)?  I want to make sure that we include these customers in our analysis.

Thanks

By "these customers" you mean the non-mass market - ie, Home Depot?

Jim

My understanding is that we are sending out an affirmative consent letter to these customers.

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

Christi & Jim,

	The Wyoming Energy Commission has a meeting on  Tuesday and Wednesday in Laramie.  Since they pay for travel, I am going to be leaving tomorrow and coming back on Thursday afternoon  (driving back to Denver to fly home).  If you need to reach me for anything I will have my cell phone, however, the outside connection for the computer is cut off, so I can only get e-mail when I come into the office.  I will come into the office on Friday morning.

Not at this time, since the language is a proposal.  Separately, I don't think Enron is going to file comments.  I will read EPSA's protest and provide comments, if necessary.  Thanks.

Christi & Sarah --

Do we have to do something related to this?  Thanks.

Jim

Note also that in a separate development FERC
simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section
206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide.
What this means is that, although only three utilities are
mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC
will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes
to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30
companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to
determine if the commission believes they exert market
power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires
power providers with market-based sales authority to amend
their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with
open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission
determines that market manipulation has occurred.

I'm ok with this.  Jennifer will be good for RTO campaign.
 
Jim
Rick:
 
To follow-up with our discussion last week, this to outline for your approval a general shift in my responsibilities, effective immediately, through the end of the year (consistent with our group's changing priorities and my pending move to Portland).
 
30% of my time
 
Provide regulatory support to West Power (Renewables, QFs, market structure issues)

Assist in the coordination of efforts between West Power and Government Affairs 
Report to Elliot Mainzer (and indirectly Chris Calger)

70% of my time
 
Contribute to the RTO campaign

Sue Nord approached me about working on this campaign.  She anticipates that the specific needs of the team will become more clear in the coming weeks. 
Report to Sue?

 
****************
Note: I expect these new responsibilities would necessitate a shift in my focus away from the work I have been doing on California and Price Risk Management, as well the occasional projects/research I do for Jim, Alan and others in this department. 
 
Please let me know your thoughts.
 
Thanks,

We are building a spreadsheet of agreements (transmission, gas transportation, pool, regional council, etc) that may be needed for a Newco Power Marketing Company to do business as a wholesale power merchant.  Attached is a spreadsheet that includes information about EPMI's transmission/pool/etc. agreements.  (use the "TRANSMISSION" spreadsheet).  Please use the current EPMI contracts listed as an example of the contracts that may be needed for NEWCO.  To start, please work on the areas listed below and email your updated spreadsheet to me.  "General..." should include any specific issues, such as AA rated company not required to provide any collateral, etc. (or parental guaranty needed, etc.) or contract must be approved by a regional committee, etc.  Include in "timing" column the estimated amount of time from request to completion of agreement and start of service:

Steve Walton and Alan Comnes -- West
Jeff Dasovich -- California
Charles Yeung -- ERCOT and other regional councils
Suzanne Calcagno -- Gas 
Marcus Nettelton -- PLEASE LET US KNOW THE AGREEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED

Susan and I will divide the rest of the spreadsheet and Bob and Harry could help with the pools that Marcus has not done. << File: Newcocontracts.XLS >> 

Please let me know the status of your review by COB Wed. and we'll proceed from there.  THANKS!!

Or doing some interviewing

Call Jeff Brown - he use to work there

To follow-up on NEPOOL matters --

Last week, the NEPOOL Members Comm did not take any action against Enron. 

I received a call today (that I intend to return tomorrow) from Dave Doot - NEPOOL Secretary.  He would like to have a phone call with Enron's attorneys and credit people to figure out how to manage our credit issues going forward.  The reason there was no action last week was because NEPOOL hoped that they could work something out.  I do not know what the bills are for EES/EEMC/EPMI?

I will call Dave Doot and find a good time for later this week when I can arranage a call with the appropriate people.

Call with any other questions.

Jim

Harry --

Let me write-up some things on this and will send to you.  Hope everyone is well.

Jim

This letter was drafted to respond to questions from Staff concerning EPMI and EES intentions going forward in the TX market.    Specifically, we need to confirm EPMI does not want to preserve REP certification (Doug), and that EES will be able to post collateral and maintain "technical and managerial resources" to comply with TX requirements for certification (Scott - anything substantive you can add?) .  

Please review and provide comments.  Call with questions.  thanks.  
Harry x35786.

 << File: TXPUCHinkle.doc >> 

Maureen --

Thanks for the information on the switching of the "held" customers.  We will process through a standard EDI transaction.

I am trying to find out who would work up the credit amount.  When I find out, I'll e-mail you.

Thanks,

Jim

Jim:

Sorry we have played phone-tag.

The couple issues I wanted to talk with you about are 1) the reference in
your Dec 4 letter regarding re-enrolling customers for switching to Enron,
and 2) the listing of Massachusetts Electric as a creditor in Enron's
bankruptcy filing.

The pending switches of the 1013 customer accounts were canceled based upon
our conversation last week.  This does not put them on 'hold' for a later
switch, since that is not feasible or appropriate.  The customers simply
remain on their former rate (Default Service or Standard Offer) until they
choose otherwise.  When/If Enron wishes to re-initiate a switch for the
customers, you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch
transaction as usual.  If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier,
the switch would be processed.  We assume you'd take care of any contract
updating that needed to be addressed with the customers, as that is a matter
between you and them.  Hope that clarifies.  Please let me know if
questions.

Have you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could
answer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the
creditor section of the bankruptcy filing?  We'd like to speak with someone
ASAP.  Thanks.

Marcus and Ed can we talk today about this.  Is there a good time?

I need to get back with NEPOOL today.  Also, while our business dropped off, I am guessing that NE-ISO has been arranging energy for our UI load and our payable is growing pretty quickly.

Jim

Ed
	
As a first step, please could you check the position as to the bonds we have posted and provide me with details as to the volume of trades we have entered into since December 2 this year and for the same period last year. In addition please could you confirm what our NEPOOL Charges have been for the last 12 months.
	
My initial reaction is that, provided the bond holders have not sought to withdraw the bonds and confirm that to us, then ISO-NE's position is considerably weakened. The fact that they only allege "purported notice" gives me something to work with, in that it is either notice or it is not.
	
The amount that they are seeking does appear to be on the high side, especially having regard to what I am assuming is  reduced activity by certainly EPMI, in NEPOOL since December 2. 
	
I will review the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy to ensure that there is nothing we have missed and subject to the data and information in respect of the bonds posted by us and the activity data I would seek to challenge this as a valid notice and state that we are still in compliance with the Financial Assurance Policy.
	
Regards,
	
Marcus

FYI

Please see attached notice of Financial Assurance Default.

 <<Enron Financial Assur Default 12_11_01.doc>> 

Agreed.  Talk w/ Joe H to confirm that we are consistent with preferred P/L policies.

Jim

I talked to John and he is going to talk with Joe H. about the negotiated rate issues with the pipelines.  If there is a recourse rate, then the ability to negotiate rates seems to (which would most likely have the same Commission oversight to protect the recourse customers) 

All--

See below.  At our request, EPSA is working on a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R. 2814, the Sawyer-Burr transmission bill that contains voluntary RTO/anti-mandatory RTO provisions.  Please see her question about our views on negotiated transmission rates.  When Jim and I spoke about this when Barton's staff asked for our views on the general concept, we told Barton's staff that there needed to be a recourse rate -- i.e., we can't let the transmission owners only have negotiated rates.  Please advise if there are other points we wish to convey to EPSA in response to her question.  I am pushing them to have a letter to Congress delivered next week when they return to session.

John

John:
Thanks for the analysis and talking points ? they're great, and I'm incorporating some of it almost verbatim as I'm working on the letter.  We'll get a draft to you soon, so that we can have this letter ready for when Congress returns.

I have one question regarding the Sawyer-Burr bill: in Section 3, there is a paragraph on negotiated rates.  This is basically the same paragraph that was in the draft legislation we discussed in the DeLay meetings in July, and it is also in the Landrieu draft transmission legislation.  What is your interpretation of this negotiated rates section?  I can't think of a situation in which this would be beneficial to transmission users, and I can't really figure out how this would even work in an RTO.

After talking to a couple of regulatory people, all I can think is that this section is meant for the benefit of transmission owners who are thinking in an Order 888-type system, where it could be possible for individual transmission owners to negotiate a rate deal, if this provision were enacted.

Any feedback?
Thanks,

>>> "Shelk, John" <John.Shelk@ENRON.com> 8/27/01 4:44:17 PM >>>

This note follows up on our discussion at the EPSA Leg. Affairs
Committee meeting last week.  We very much appreciate EPSA's willingness
to send a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R.
2814, the Sawyer-Burr legislation introduced on August 2nd, as part of a
broader effort to educate committee members about the serious problems
with this legislation.

First, as we discussed, while the overall transmission thrust of the
bill is largely acceptable, there are two major problems: (1) there are
anti-RTO/pro-voluntary RTO "nuggets" (see below) and (2) the bill has
the old or old, old NERC reliability language.

The anti-RTO/pro-voluntary RTO "nuggets" are as follows:

	1.	Sec. 3 (transmission pricing) (page 5).  You will note
that the bill says that the required FERC transmission pricing
regulations shall provide incentives to utilities to promote voluntary
RTOs without having the effect of forcing utilities to join RTOs; the
regulations shall limit pancaking, but not during a reasonable
transition period, and in any event, transmission rates can be based on
a single utility's costs.

	2.	Sec. 6 (voluntary development of RTOs) (starting on page
40).  The bill requires FERC to approve RTOs where the participation is
voluntary.  Of particular note is page 40, lines 21-23, which says that
the form, structure and operating entity of the RTO must be approved by
the participating utilities.  At a minimum, this language gives the
utilities a veto over other market participants.  This could also be
read as saying the utilities and only the transmitting utilities make
these critical governance decisions without participation by others.
The section prohibits FERC from conditioning any order under the Federal
Power Act on a utility transferring operational control of facilities to
an ISO or RTO.

Second, we agreed that some talking points are needed to include in the
letter and in our lobbying.  A review of the rest of the bill shows that
we can actually use the general thrust of the bill against the sponsors
as follows below.  We need to let them "save face" by separating the
pro-transmission system features of the bill from the anti-RTO language.
Please let me know if EPSA wishes to write a draft for review or whether
you wish us to supply one.  The suggested talking points are:

	a.	EPSA welcomes the bill's acknowledgment of the
importance of improving the transmission system generally and the
critical role of RTOs in particular (e.g., sec. 7 of the bill has a
central role for RTOs in siting of key transmission lines);

	b.	EPSA agrees that transmission pricing is important to
providing incentives to improve the transmission system;

	c.	However, EPSA also believes that it is inappropriate to
tie FERC's hands on RTOs in the name of improving the system when
reducing FERC's authority will make it harder, not easier, to improve
the transmission system; FERC tried a voluntary approach to RTOs and it
has been painfully slow; RTOs need to be of a size and configuration
that parallels natural trading markets and power flows; and this is not
a federal v. state issue as regions exist and would be encouraged under
the bill, the real question is what type of regions (perhaps this latter
point goes before the one on size and scope);

	d.	Congress can address the transmission pricing and siting
issues without the voluntary RTO language.

	e.	Point out the problems with the NERC reliability
language.

Let me know how EPSA wishes to proceed.  We strongly recommend that the
final letter go out next week so it is received as Congress returns from
the August Recess.

Thanks.

Attached please find Sept's Government Affairs report.

If you would like to discuss, please let me know. 

Thanks,

Didn't know about this.  Have we compared this list to our gas market termination list?

Jane - Can you please send me the list?

Jim

Jim,
Are you all over this?  Is there a chance that we lose operations at these utilities before we can sell the markets?

Don,

Attached is a list of surety bonds which involve EES with expiration dates that range from February 02 through October 02 that we do not plan on renewing.  Notices were received regarding early termination and/or non-renewal.  All of the notices will be forwarded to Carol St. Clair.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further please feel free to call.

Thank you,

I called Molly Harris, she said there wasnt any one left in her dept. and that you should be able to help with the bonds for these companies, if there is someone else I should be contact, please let me know.  

Bill, attached is a list of bonds that our broker (John L. Wortham, LLP) received a notice of cancellation on from  Fireman's Fund and Safeco.   Please determine which obligations will be required in the future.  However our broker has offered assistance in establishing a replacement surety, but you may also want to investigate alternative form of acceptable security.  

Please let me know if you need copies or if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks.

Customers we will start to de-DASR probably next week.  VERY CONFIDENTIAL

This is the list we had Thursday last week.  Please let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,

Evan
The attached list details the California De-DASR status (by customer) as of this afternoon.  This list was prepared using the prior guidance of "...all customers pre-June/August with the exception of PacTel, IBM and UC/CSU".

Please note that there are two tabs to the spreadsheet.  fyi -- You need to scroll to the bottom of the EESO List to see those customers that are not "qued".

We are prepared to launch the De-DASR's but want to confirm via this message that everyone agrees with each individual customer status.

Please give me a call if you need additional information -- or have any edits or changes.

Thanks,

Evan

 

I see that UC/CSU is on this list.  Have any buyers been interested in their load?

Dan, etal --

Someone from CSC was on the call (Allison Hafner).  

TXU said the meters were to be read by Dec 13 with final EDI files sent to ERCOT by Dec 14.  ERCOT would process a REP of Record change on Dec 13.  

Looks like everything is ok.

Jim

Joe - 

We are all under pressure to operate in our current mode, but we are all still on the same team.

Anything that I can do to help?

Thanks - Dan

Who do you think should attend?

Someone from EES needs to be on this conference call.  I will not be babysitting to make sure someone does sit in, so the responsibilty is yours to take care of the drop to POLR.  The desk has done all it can do regarding this subject.

-Joe

We would like to have a conference call today at 11:30 to discuss the Enron Drop to POLR.  The conference call number is:  1-800-430-8190 with a pass code of 7260.  Please let me know if you will not be able to call in.
 
Thank you,

I will review the list.  But I need someone from gas team and someone from power team to help.  Let's talk at 9am meeting tomorrow.

Jim

We definitely need to quickly review this list and understand possible impact to our current strategy. Jim-you got it?
Sure - I talked to Ed Sacks and there are some on the list that he is already working on.  I imagine that we have defaulted under the surety and the CP can now collect, but have not seen the actual notices yet.  I have asked Mary Grisaffi to forward them to Carol St. Clair for review.

Didn't know about this.  Have we compared this list to our gas market termination list?

Can we get together this afternoon to discuss calling NEPOOL?  How about 3pm?

Jim

It appears that the calculation and collateral call is pretty accurate.  Basically, EPMI had made significant purchases from the New England pool to fill the UI, NSTAR and CMP load (approx 1,000 mw/h).  Based on a 42 hour post petition calculation, ISO projects 30 day exposure at $39MM.  Since collateral is calculated at 3.5x, we would owe $137MM in collateral.  Unless we feel that our load/supply shape will change, as per the letter, we can request the ISO to reconsider the collateral amount.  Let me know your thoughts.

Ed Sacks

Let's meet at Christi's desk on ebS5 and find a conference room.

Please let me know where we are meeting if everyone plans on attending.

Suzanne --

Becky Cantrell had entered Enron into a number of dockets before FERC related to pipeline rate and other matters (not sure if there were protests).  I would greatly appreciate you coming over to 47 and going through a number of filings so we can either (a) stay in the case or (b) remove our name as an active party.  Elizabeth Linnell has the papers on 47.

My initial thought is that Enron does not need to continue in these cases, but the NewCo will want to understand what to join after formation.  We may want to talk with commercial types to gauge their thoughts.

Please let me know if you can take care of this.

Thanks,

Jim

Paul --

I have no information as discussed below.

Jim

We are about to make an HSR filing with the federal government regarding the sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural. In that regard, we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our analysis of the transaction. 

I would appreciate it if you would review the attached memo and either provide the appropriate materials to me or confirm that you have no documents responsive to the request.

Please review and respond immediately to let me know whether you have any materials. We are nearing the deadline for filing our HSR. In particular, if you have a copy of any of the following documents, please let me know:

	(1) Draft information memorandum from Credit Suisse dated March 2001
 
    (2) Information memorandum from Credit Suisse prepared in August of 1999
 
    (3) Portland General management presentation dated June 2001.

 

Thanks.

Mary Lynne -- Is this for both EES and EEMC?  Is EPMI in this bill?  Can we pay separately by company?

Jim

We have the following ISO payments for NOVEMBER business:

PJM    $134,457  -Due on Dec. 20

New England ISO $6,465,680 - Due on Dec 20

New York  ISO   $524,506  Due on Dec 18

Are we paying???

We looked at this data and found that if you look at it on a percentage basis you are skewing the story. I explained to her in an email what we did and what our positions had been (generally) so they should put two and two together. This is a mute point at this stage as we no longer exist.

I told them that if they have specific questions then we would be more than happy to answer them.

Doug --

It seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.  I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly. I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?

Let's sit down on Thursday am and talk.

Jim  

I am out til wednesday. I would be happy to answer any qustions they have if they could send them over. I am not going to educate them on anything else.

PJM sent a bill for the 2002 Annual Fee (for $5000).

Upon paying the fee, EPMI will be able to access E-Schedules.  

PJM is looking for payment on December 20, 2001 along with our November grid payment.

I assume that no Enron company will need the E-Schedule system after January 1 and therefore we will not be making this payment?

Please advise.

Jim

Also have we returned our physical PJM customers yet?

Jim

Jim -

The only thing I can think of is how it will affect some of the bundled deals still under review - if they have sites in PJM.

With the cancellation of a number of Surety Bonds by our providers, we are faced with a potential credit crunch in NEPOOL.  

Also, it is my understanding (although I haven't seen anything) that our Nov 2001 bills are due in all of the markets on Dec 20, 2001.
 
Christi and I are trying to work out our payment plans (if any) and other requirements to keep our books afloat.  

We need to have support on understanding any payment obligations (and bills if we have them) and issues (e.g., Annual Fees).  Who can we talk with for each market?

Joe / Thane

TXU was not able to send ERCOT the files as they had stated earlier this
week.  Here is the meter read information for 7 of the 11 meters.  The
other 4 will be read today.  The files (867_03) will be sent on Monday,
all still with a meter read date of 12/13/01.  This will update ERCOT's
system to show that Enron is no longer the REP of record for these 11
ESI IDs, once the files are processed.

Thane, please note, if I am correct, when initials are run for 12/14,
12/15 (as they are run 3 days later) the load may still show for Enron,
however on final statements, it will be fixed, as the meter data will
have been run through our system to update correctly.

Please call me if questions.

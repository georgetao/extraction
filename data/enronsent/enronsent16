Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name?

	
	

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Samuel

   

	
	                           
	

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie    

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Any GCP adjustments will be highlighted in red.

Attn. GCP_London:
There's a new EOL Counterparty listed in the UK. Please respond.

To summarize and in response to our meeting last week:

1.   I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the 
Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.  Please 
let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes 
you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team 
Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people 
you would like the list circulated to.

2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed 
to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by 
email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company 
and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for 
EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I 
prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the 
dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so 
an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some 
other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).

3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to 
circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate 
the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed 
with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should 
also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, 
except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).

4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she 
has prepared that should be added to the list.

If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please 
call me at x33399.

I wanted to thank you and your team for getting this done so quickly.  I 
really appreciate it!

Tana - It has been some time since we have spoken/emailed/voice mailed ....  
How y'all doing? Things are good in Toronto now that winter is almost over.

Will you help me out with something?  I need to know if we are able to do a 
power swap under the ECT ISDA with National Bank of Canada.  I looked it up 
on the database and do not see any restrictions but I wanted to make sure.

See you in San Antonio.

As a further to my previous email, the EOL Group will code the weather 
transactions to fall under the financial master, and the Confirmation Desk 
should confirm the weather trades under the current form of confirmation.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, Bob Bowen, Mark Taylor and Brant Reves, 
we are going to open Aquila Risk Management Corporation to trade weather 
under the EOL GTC's. 

I'm sorry about not turning this around sooner.  I thought I might be getting 
other comments from you.  If it meets with your approval, please sign it and 
return it via fax no. (713) 646-3490 and I will have it signed by Enron and 
return a copy to you by fax.

We can find no record that the above entity has filed market based rates with 
FERC as required by the Federal Power Act. Suggest that we notify them that 
we can find no record of any such filing and as a consequence of which will 
need to turn them off from the being able to sell on EOL, however they can 
continue to purchase and once they have made, or can demonstrate to us that 
they have made the requisite filing with FERC, we will open them up for sell 
transactions as well.

Bill,

I think you are about to become my new best friend!

We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on 
EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  The 
Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled:  Koch Industries, Inc., 
acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  (Which also happens to 
be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this 
Counterparty.)

They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already 
set up:  (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a 
division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty 
and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal 
incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully 
did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.

Can you help us?!!!

Can you help me with this?

Clem,

Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.  Carolyn started 
working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in 
1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!).  
Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas 
Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key 
contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the 
primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB 
relationship for the law firm.

Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be 
around.  I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate 
Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and 
Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc.  I 
think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron.

tana,
to whom does my attorney have to talk to about legal issues?

Sorry about that!

With respect to the amendment to the list for 4/18/01, the approval I sent 
down earlier should still be good since I'm the one that figure out she said 
approve for financial and then had them shut down for financial.

Per verification recd below and pending letterhead documentation from the 
counterparty, CP# 95964 Western Area Power Administration - Desert SW Region 
will be inactivated in GCP.  CP# 47358 will involve a name change procedure

Bernice, here is the information on WAPA counterparties.  I will send you a 
specific request on each of these entities when I can get to it.  In the 
meantime, can you please change the name for WAPA phonenix to WAPA-Desert 
Southwest Region so that we do not have duplicate records and tell EOL about 
the changes.  Let me know if you have questions.  EOL is waiting for me to 
populate a contract for the new record that you set up for desert SW region 
and we need to get this resolved.  
These offices are members:

WAPA-Colorado River Storage Project Manangement Center (CRSP)  (This office 
is in Salt Lake City and was formerly known as Salt Lake City Area or Upper 
Colorado)

WAPA-Desert Southwest Region (This office is in Phoenix and was formerly know 
as Phoenix Area, or Lower Colorado)

WAPA-Rocky Mountain Region  (This office is in Loveland, Colorado and was 
formerly known as Loveland Area, Loveland-Fort Collins Area, and Lower 
Missouri)

WAPA-Upper Great Plains Region (This office is in Billings, MT, and was 
formerly known as Billings Area, Upper Missouri, and Pick-Sloan Missouri)

You can find information about all these offices at our website:  www.wapa.gov

Thanks,   Mark Meyer

I work for Enron and am trying to determine (1) which of your offices are
members of the Western Systems Power Pool and (2) what the current names
are for your entitites.  I need the full legal name for each.  Below is a
list of the names I have in my database of names.  Can you please confirm
if these are current and/or if any names have been changed.  The WSPP
Administrator sent me the attachment, which indicates the Phoenix office
houses "Lower Colorado".  I'm not sure if this is accurate.  Thank you very
much for your help.

WAPA-Salt Lake City
WAPA-Desert Southwest Region
WAPA-Lower Missouri
WAPA-Pick-Sloan Missouri
WAPA-Rocky Mountain

To all,

The new Enron Center Garage has opened and if those of you that have accepted 
spaces at the new garage would please return your Met and Allen Center 
parking cards ASAP,so that we can back fill your spaces with others on the 
waiting list.  The Allen Center and Met cards will be deactivated 
immediately. Please contact Parking and Transportation if you have any 
questions.  You may hand your old card to the security guard at the garage 
exit through the end of this week.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Legal is OK to open the above counterparty immediately for US east physical

up in GCP or in the agency name.  There are deals in Enpower under the 
corporate name and they are confirmed under the GTC.

Our only concerns are that we have the appropriate tax forms signed and 
in-house before they start trading.   If they trade U.S. products from the UK 
we will have to get the appropriate U.S. tax forms in, and Edmund can address 
any UK tax forms they might need on UK products traded from the UK.

I have revised the list to add a few more NDAs that have come to my 
attention, and then am also sending the regular Net Works NDA List as well.  
I hope these are helpful.

You are the best!

Tana,

As per conversation, attached are two forms of letter that we have used in 
the past when requesting legal advise from local counsel.  The long form is 
the letter that Alan and Sara worked on with Allen & Overy back in 1996.  The 
short form is the letter that Mike Robison has used when dealing directly 
with local counsel requesting advise in connection with physical trading 
matters.  I hope this is helpful.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks.

Would you like to set up this meeting or would you like me to?  I would like 
to get this Koch thing resolved ASAP, so I think the sooner, the better.  
From Legal's side, both Mary Cook and I need to be included, I spoke to 
Credit and both Walter Guidroz and Tom Moran would like to be included, 
probably Joe Hunter from the Confirm Desk as well, and anyone else you're 
aware of.  Let me know how you think we should proceed.

With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to 
follow):

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent 
for three listed utilities

Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and 
Sam know then Sam can get them set us.

Thanks for your help!

Hi guys,

This came up in the conference call today... but I forgot who it actually was 
who requested the information.  Please disregard (or use) as necessary.

Lara
Reminder on the rules for Credit Default Swaps and Bankruptcy Swaps (see 
Anna's email from earlier this morning as well).

Hi guys,

We're launching (new) Bankruptcy Swaps and brand new Credit Default Swaps on 
Monday.

As usual there are 'special' rules that surround these products.  I'm in the 
process of setting all the Guest Profiles to reflect these rules but wanted 
to pass the information on for PAs that we receive.  
Houston- can you please forward to your appropriate Legal teams?  if they 
have specific questions regarding these products or the legal framework 
surrounding them, please refer them to Denis O'Connell, the London lawyer who 
has worked on the GTCs etc.

 Credit Default Swaps
You have to be a special kind of counterparty to trade these products (please 
see Denis for required documentation needed) and they are taking a very 
targeted marketing approach to their customers.  Because of this (for now) 
only US and UK counterparties can have View access.

Bankruptcy Swaps - we used to have 5 product types for Bankruptcy Swaps (Nor, 
UK, US, SE, FI) but these have been consolidated under new terms into 1 
(Global) Bankruptcy Swap.  The other 5 product types will be moved to 
Inactive as they have never traded.

Also, a new Web Filter will be used to pull in the new Bankruptcy and Credit 
Default Swaps - Global Credit Instruments.  Please advise any customers to 
use this web filter to view the products (provided they are in a country who 
has been approved to View/Trade them).  

Please reference the table and the list below for information on Guest Access 
for the different Countries.

If you have any questions at all, please give us a call.

Lara
Hi Denis,

I'm trying to figure out what the 'Rules' are for the Bankruptcy and Credit 
Default Swaps go as far as Guest Access to EnronOnline.

Based upon your profile spreadsheet from Wednesday, here's what it looks 
like.  Please let me know if there are any differences as I will be 
communicating these rules to the London and Houston Product Control Groups.  

Also, can you please tell me which countries Could and Could Not trade the 
two products (with proper certification in place of course).  As discussed 
earlier this week, I believe you will be communicating this to the Houston 
Legal team directly... so I'm just asking as an fyi.

Thanks,
Lara

In the table below - 'N' means the country can Not View the products, 'R' 
means the country can View the products

Also can you please tell me what the rules are for the following countries 
for both Bankruptcy and CDS:
Per Denis O'Connell, none of the below Countries can have VIEW access to 
either CDS or Bankruptcy Swaps

Please change your records to relect that Legal has agreed to open the 
referenced counterparty to trade any financial products.

At Wendi's request, I have submitted a request to get you both edit access to 
the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  In the meantime, below is the icon 
that will allow you to have view access to everything but the comments.  I 
will let you know when your edit access is approved (at which time you will 
be able to input changes/comments, as well as be able to see comments).

Just a note so we are all on the same page... I just had a superseded and 
replaced Enron Corp. guaranty that the counterparty returned to me, and I 
asked Clem to verify what he wanted me to do with the old original guaranty, 
and he said to send it back to him and he would have Cindy mark it 
"canceled".

I havent heard anything back from them, Mark, have you?

suggestions..., but at least we'll have something!

Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the Swap Group, Doug Friedman was

Bill,

I think you are about to become my new best friend!

We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on 
EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  The 
Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled:  Koch Industries, Inc., 
acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  (Which also happens to 
be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this 
Counterparty.)

They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already 
set up:  (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a 
division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty 
and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal 
incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully 
did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.

Can you help us?!!!

Are you ok with this (they would not be listing, as agent for 3 listed 
utilities)?

I have checked with Kim Theriot and if no one has any objections, we would 
like to be consistent with the way we have handled agency situations 
previously.  Set the name  up in Global as Alliant Energy Corporate Services, 
Inc. , as authorized agent .  I will make a counterparty specific template 
that includes the rest of the legal name of the counterparty.  We have sent 
this format to other agency entities and it was accepted.

Please let me know when this has been done.  We will have to move records in 
the Enpower system because a new record was set up.

Thanks!

Tana,

Could you please email Angela Chen the link for the Financial Trade 
Agreements Notes database?  Thanks very much!

Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company shouldn't be a problem for 
weather transactions.  The Master Agreement we have in place with them is an 
ISDA Local Currency.  The only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation 
adding the trade option rep for weather, since weather wasn't covered way 
back then.  Otherwise, they are already approved for all products for online 
trading.  Since the master is a Local Currency form, we might run into some 
problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products, or use any other 
currency other than U.S. $$.  If either of those issues come up, let me know.

As a follow-up to a recent discussion with Tana Jones concerning counterparty 
divisions, a meeting is being setup for Monday, April 30, from 1:00 PM thru 
3:00 PM, to discuss counterparty naming conventions for Divisions, DBA's,  
Agencies and the requirements of downstream systems.  A few examples of 
encountered naming variations are as follows:
 1) Koch Industries versus Koch Industries, a division of Koch Corporation
 2)  Doing Business As, Koch Industries versus Koch Industries Inc. 
 3) Hess Energy Trading (UK) Limited versus Hess Energy Trading (UK) Limited, 
as agent for Hess Energy Trading LLC
 4) Legal structure change i.e. a counterparty changes from a corporation to 
LLC 

A few of the questions or issues surrounding counterparty name variations are 
as follows:
 1) Counterparties that are shared between Enron companies 
 2) Duplicate counterparties 
 3) Confirmations needs
 4) Credit roll-up
 5) Contract needs
 6) Netting Issues
 
I have attempted to describe the most common of situations encountered 
involving naming conventions but if any further consideration or 
clarification is needed in regard to this matter, please feel free to add to 
the above examples/ issues list or telephone me at ext.39249.

Julissa Marron, ext. 5836 will send out the meeting invitation with the room 
location.

Hi Tana -  

We need your assistance in preparing termination letters for the transactions 
listed on the attached spreadsheet and described as follows:

On Friday, April 20, 2001, four transactions occurred on EnronOnline that 
were in error.  One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L.P. and three 
transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  As mutually agreed 
to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties, it 
was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and 
should be terminated.  

The exact specifics are detailed as follows:

? The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual 
production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member, Melba 
Lozano.  Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline 
test system of EnronOnline.  

? The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis.  However, 
in his absence on Friday, the product was managed by Matt Lenhart.

? Steve South, trader on the West Desk, called and notified both Morgan and 
Coral that the product had been posted in error.  All parties agreed that the 
transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing.  As a result they 
further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that 
the deals would be "killed" on all sides.  (For reference of any telephone 
tapes that may need to be pulled, the conversations with the counterparties 
occurred around 2:00 pm.)

? No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the 
transactions in TAGG.

? I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday (April 23, 2001) and advised him that 
termination letters may be required by Legal.  He responded that he had no 
problem with that.

Tana, please advise if additional information is required to complete the 
termination letters or if another course of action is warranted.

Thank you,

Rob Cass

I really don't know.  Maybe the icon, which is just a shortcut to the

to make sure we protect both parties.  The NDA is attached below and can
be faxed back to me at 866-488-4646.  If you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to give me a call.

Best regards,
Kathy

Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company shouldn't be a problem for 
weather transactions.  The Master Agreement we have in place with them is an 
ISDA Local Currency.  The only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation 
adding the trade option rep for weather, since weather wasn't covered way 
back then.  Otherwise, they are already approved for all products for online 
trading.  Since the master is a Local Currency form, we might run into some 
problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products, or use any other 
currency other than U.S. $$.  If either of those issues come up, let me know.

marcus is ok with the name change without the "for 3 listed utilities", so 
let it fly!

agency type arrangements. Credit are fully aware of this and will manage the 
exposure accordingly.

The nonsolicitation clause is one way (rest is bilateral)  so if it is 
included you have to remember to fill in its blanks.  (You probably would 
remember this anyway!)

As an FYI, from time to time I will be preparing NDAs for the Networks team 
headed by Mark S. Palmer working with Travis on "Project Offline".  Project 
Offline has evolved a form of NDA and added a non-solicitation clause and a 
residuals clause.  I wanted you to be familiar with the form in case Travis 
is not here, you,as are my backup lawyer for the Networks team.  The form, 
like all my Networks forms is kept in my "Confidentiality Agreements" 
subdirectory under "Forms" (in case you ever need it and I'm not around).

Do we have any NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty?

Thank you for submitting your form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  However, 
Enron prefers to use its form of Non-Disclosure Agreement in these types of 
transactions.  In that regard, I am attaching our form of agreement.  If you 
have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at 
(713) 345-8897.  We look forward to hearing from you.

Attached for your review is a list of the NDAs we either have executed or 
have sent drafts to the customer.  Please take time to review this list to 
make sure that the status of any NDA you are interested in is correctly 
reflected.  Call me at x33399 with any comments or questions.

Topic:
Using Enron's back office services to process their energy deal transactions.

This has nothing to do with EnronOnline.  Please do not include EnronOnline 
terminology in the NDA, as it will only delay this effort.  Thanks in advance 
for your timely response.

Do we have any NDAs in place with the referenced counterparty?

Per the request of Lucy Ortiz, I have reviewed the current list of weather 
counterparties we are trading with, and have targeted four counterparties 
that we have open for trading weather offline that  I am now going to open 
for online trading.

1.  El Paso Energy Marketing Marketing Company, name change as of 12/1/99 to  
El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company - previously approved for all products, 
except weather, now add approved for weather also.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement 
in place.
2.  Madison Gas and Electric Company - previously not approved for any 
financial products, now approving for all financial products.  No Master 
Agreement in place.  Credit, we need to pursue this financial master.
3. Swiss Re Financial Products Corp. - we previously did not approve this 
counterparty for any financial trading - now open for weather financial 
trading only.   No Master Agreement currently in place; however, we are 
getting close on the negotiation of this ISDA Master.
4.  Vitol N.A. - we previously had them approved for all products, but 
weather, open them up for weather, as well.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement in 
place.  Steve Douglas, counterparty is a Swiss corporation and have never 
sent us their tax forms.

Quick Draw...!!!

To all,

The new Enron Center Garage has opened and if those of you that have accepted 
spaces at the new garage would please return your Met and Allen Center 
parking cards ASAP,so that we can back fill your spaces with others on the 
waiting list.  The Allen Center and Met cards will be deactivated 
immediately. Please contact Parking and Transportation if you have any 
questions.  You may hand your old card to the security guard at the garage 
exit through the end of this week.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

We've picked up two more diners for La Fogata in San Antonio, Andrea Calo and 
Yao Apasu.  Can you call back the restaurant and switch our reservation to 
two tables of 8 people, instead of one table of 14.  I think a table of 8 
will be more manageable than a table of 16.  Thanks!

As we discussed, attached is my "Cheat Sheet" which I use to guide me when 
approving non-US counterparties that come in through EnronOnline via Houston 
Credit.  London Legal and I try to coordinate our responses but I cannot 
speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties 
to trade online.  They also frequently deal with different countries than 
us.  You may want to speak to Justin Boyd.  Generally, with respect to most 
physical trading, except power trading, there are no legal restrictions to 
trading.  Most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial 
products.  Physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence 
outside of the US and the UK and bandwidth is therefore not open to non US 
and UK counterparties.

With physical power, generally, in most countries they require some sort of 
power marketing license so I look to the power lawyers to guide me.

As I also mentioned, for Japan or Australian based counterparties I wait for 
David Minns or Jane McBride to advise me.

A group of us have decided to gather for dinner on the Wednesday night before 
the legal conference and wish to extend an invitation for you to join us for 
good food and fellowship and maybe a few drinks.  We have reservations for 
8:00 pm at Delores Del Rio, which is a small Italian restaurant on the 
river.  They have excellent food and live Jazz music.  Very small and quaint 
little place and away from the crush of the party places on the river.

I will need to give a final head count to the restaurant on Wednesday.  If 
you can join us, or know of anyone who would like to, please let me know and 
I will get directions, or we can all walk over from the hotel.  It is a very 
short walk.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Thanks,

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

To summarize and in response to our meeting last week:

1.   I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the 
Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.  Please 
let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes 
you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team 
Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people 
you would like the list circulated to.

2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed 
to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by 
email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company 
and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for 
EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I 
prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the 
dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so 
an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some 
other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).

3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to 
circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate 
the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed 
with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should 
also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, 
except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).

4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she 
has prepared that should be added to the list.

If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please 
call me at x33399.

ISO9.com and ANSI Establish Reselling Agreement for the ISO 9000:2000 
Standards 
New York, NY and Oakland, CA, December 11, 2000 - ISO9.com and the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) have announced an agreement regarding 
U.S. distribution of the ISO 9000 series of quality management system 
standards, including the soon to be published ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 
standards. ISO9.com sells electronic versions of the Standards on the 
Internet at http://store.iso9.com. The new version of ISO 9000 will be 
available on December 15.

"Distribution of the ISO 9000 standards is an important step for our 
organization," said Glenn Kohner, Founder and CTO of ISO9.com. "Customers on 
the Internet expect instant delivery of information. Users on our site are 
learning about Internet ISO 9000. It's only natural that they would want 
access to the actual Standards."

There are two ways to procure the ISO 9000 standards from ISO9.com. The 
Standards, which a company is required to own to be in compliance, will be 
offered both independently and bundled with the ISO9.com application. With 
the integrated version, companies will be able to view the Standard alongside 
their QMS, in a seamless format. 
"ISO9.com is one of ANSI's more unique value added resellers in that it has 
actually integrated the ISO 9001:2000 standard into its application," 
commented Bob Feghali, ANSI vice president of business development and chief 
information officer. "We are committed to fast action in the delivery of the 
new ISO 9000 revisions; partnering with ISO9.com will greatly assist ANSI in 
our ability to insure a widespread distribution of the complete ISO 9000 
family of standards."

Sergio Mazza, past President of ANSI, Appointed to Board of Directors

Oakland, CA. November 21, 2000 - ISO9.com, the world's first Application 
Service Provider to the ISO marketplace, announced the addition of Sergio 
Mazza to the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Mazza served as the president 
of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) from 1993 through 1998. 
ANSI is a private, nonprofit membership organization supported by a diverse 
constituency of private and public sector organizations which has served as 
administrator and coordinator of private sector voluntary standardization 
systems in the United States for more than 80 years. As a member of the Board 
of Directors, Mr. Mazza will bring his depth of experience and knowledge in 
both international standards and high technology to help the Company achieve 
its corporate vision.

"We are truly excited to have Sergio Mazza join our team," said Fred 
Hornbacher, CEO of ISO9.com. "He has tremendous depth of experience in our 
highly specialized field, and is uniquely qualified to help us bring our 
online vision for the quality and standards industries to fruition."

Mr. Mazza's 21 years of proven leadership experience with high technology 
service businesses and his six years as the president of ANSI will both be 
instrumental in his new role with ISO9.com. His corporate career and 
leadership experience ranges from his activity as a software entrepreneur to 
his service as president of Memorex North America and Memorex Computer 
Supplies Worldwide. Mr. Mazza has recently been working as an advisor to 
online companies. He has extensive international experience, is fluent in 
four languages, and holds a BS degree in economics from the University of 
Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

organization," said Glenn Kohner, Founder and CTO of ISO9.com. "Customers on 
the Internet expect instant delivery of information. Users on our site are 
learning about Internet ISO 9000. It's only natural that they would want 
access to the actual Standards."

There are two ways to procure the ISO 9000 standards from ISO9.com. The 
Standards, which a company is required to own to be in compliance, will be 
offered both independently and bundled with the ISO9.com application. With 
the integrated version, companies will be able to view the Standard alongside 
their QMS, in a seamless format. 
"ISO9.com is one of ANSI's more unique value added resellers in that it has 
actually integrated the ISO 9001:2000 standard into its application," 
commented Bob Feghali, ANSI vice president of business development and chief 
information officer. "We are committed to fast action in the delivery of the 
new ISO 9000 revisions; partnering with ISO9.com will greatly assist ANSI in 
our ability to insure a widespread distribution of the complete ISO 9000 
family of standards."

At the request of Mark Palmer, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   I have also attached a blacklined draft showing 
the changes from the iPlanet draft.  If the enclosed meets with your 
approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 
646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments 
or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or 
me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.

kim,

below are the four "oops" trades the prompted my changing of the procedure.  
I left a voicemail for the trader to provide me with the phone number and 
name of the person who he spoke to but he never returned my calls.  I guess, 
if someone from Joe's group could please prepare the two termination letters 
and get them signed...

Thanks.

Tana -
This e-mail includes the attachment.  It "fell off" my e-mail from last night.

Thanks -

Hi Tana -  

We need your assistance in preparing termination letters for the transactions 
listed on the attached spreadsheet and described as follows:

On Friday, April 20, 2001, four transactions occurred on EnronOnline that 
were in error.  One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L.P. and three 
transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  As mutually agreed 
to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties, it 
was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and 
should be terminated.  

The exact specifics are detailed as follows:

? The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual 
production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member, Melba 
Lozano.  Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline 
test system of EnronOnline.  

? The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis.  However, 
in his absence on Friday, the product was managed by Matt Lenhart.

? Steve South, trader on the West Desk, called and notified both Morgan and 
Coral that the product had been posted in error.  All parties agreed that the 
transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing.  As a result they 
further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that 
the deals would be "killed" on all sides.  (For reference of any telephone 
tapes that may need to be pulled, the conversations with the counterparties 
occurred around 2:00 pm.)

? No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the 
transactions in TAGG.

? I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday (April 23, 2001) and advised him that 
termination letters may be required by Legal.  He responded that he had no 
problem with that.

Tana, please advise if additional information is required to complete the 
termination letters or if another course of action is warranted.

Thank you,

Rob Cass

Stacy,

I don't know anything about this, I guess it's yours?
Dale Neuner on 01/11/2000 01:50:27 PM
I'm not sure who the best person to address this issue to is. Please let me 
know if this is something you can answer:

Canada has inadvertently created two products, one 29-day (Feb) and one  
31-day (Mar) in the > 1 Month < 1 Year category, and wants to move them to 
the < 1 Month category. As you can see below, the GTC's are the same for 
either category. Can you check and make sure that the Master Agreements don't 
prohibit this?

David Forster

Looks like I was confused. There is only one Canadian GTC. The split was done 
solely to accomodate the different Master Agreements.

I don't have a problem moving 31 day deals into the <1 month category, but 
you should check with Contracts first, to confirm that the <31 day Canadian 
Master Agreements do not prohibit this.

Dave

Edmund: Here is the latest Canadian GTC.

Mark/Elena:  We have two kinds of Master Agreement in Canada: Less than 31 
days and greater than 31 days. As a result, we will need the two product 
types for Western Canadian Gas. However, the same Canadian GTC can be mapped 
to both product types. Could you two please coordinate on making the 
necessary changes to the system and spreadsheet?

If this is not clear to anyone, please call.

Thanks,

Dave

Just a note to always remember to check "ERMS", we are frequently amending or 
updating and replacing old ERMS masters with ISDAs and ERMS should always be 
added as a company when you prepare the legal credit list.  Thanks.

letters of credit, certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by=

consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX=20
Divisions.

! Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit=20

! Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20

Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=

as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =

TO:
All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Use of Letters of Credit, Certain Securities and Deliverable Warehouse=20
Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and COMEX Transactions

DATE:

! Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved changes =
to=20
NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Association rules, which have also been filed with=
=20
the CFTC, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may depos=
it=20
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

! Specifically, the rule changes, which are attached below, permit the use =
of=20
letters of credit, certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by=
=20
customers to meet their margin requirements. The rule changes provide for=
=20
consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX=20
Divisions.

! Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit=20
(LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

! Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a =01&pass-through=018 basis =
on both=20
divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able=
=20
to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. =
It=20
should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a=
s=20
detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m=
ay=20
not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin=
=20
obligations with the clearinghouse.

! Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim=
e=20
on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer=
s=20
to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member=
s=20
on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the=
=20
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter=
=20
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve=
=20
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=
ne=20
issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20
value.

! Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=
=20
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted=
=20
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =
no=20
more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

! Effective Date. These rule changes will go into effect on June 1, 2001.

! Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit.  A follow-up Notice to=
=20
Clearing Members will be distributed shortly that will include a form=20
prepared by NYMEX that will serve as the authorized  uniform form for=20
irrevocable letters of credit for use on a pass-through basis at the Exchan=
ge=20
.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)=

We have had an overwhelmingly favorable response to the May19 Church 
Gourmet.  I have already added one extra party to accomodate the additional 
guests.  We now have 48 participants and need a place at the table for 2 or 4 
of them.  Is there any way that Tana or Kleta could add a couple of chairs to 
their tables to squeeze in two more?  Poor Lisa Kennedy has found herself 
with a potential for 16 guests in her townhouse and is not sure where they 
will all fit.  

If Henry and I could move to Tana's house and Kleta could pick up Dan and 
Andrea Goodwin, this would solve the problem.

This is a great problem to have - more than half of the participants in the 
dinner are new members at CTK - I hope you can help out.

ALG

P.S.  We can loan you extra chairs if necessary..

We have received a faxed copy of the Amendment to the Electronic Trading 
Agreement between ENA and the referenced Counterparty dated January 11, 
2000.  The original will follow by Fedex.

Copies will be distributed.

Any conflicts?

At the request of Dave Forster, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will

call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 
853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.

Sheri,

I need to know the nature of the discussions we will be having with this 
company so I know how to word the decription in the agreement.  Also, usually 
I email the agreements directly to the counterparty, so unless he will be 
delivering this in another manner, I will need an email address.

Ken Keefer is not sure who will sign on behalf of Ajilon.  David Berberian

John has a meeting with them the week of May 14.  Please let me know if you 
need any additional info.  

Thanks!

So long as there is a copy of the notice in the appropriate files then I do

Jeff,

I recieved a notification from CMS Field Services, Inc. indicating that 
effective 5/15/01 they will begin recording purchase, sale and derivative 
transactions for natural gas between our companies.  I have sent a copy to 
the fileroom, should I forward a copy to you also?  I spoke with one of the 
Adminative Assistants on the Trading floor and they thought that I should 
contact Legal.  Please advise.

Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,=
=20
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018) will go into effect.

! In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will=20
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing=

brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

! The term =01&executing broker=018 as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the reg=

! Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up=20

exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer=
=20
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule=

Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018)

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the=
=20
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing=
=20
Members, the following rules shall define the respective=20
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The =01&executi=
ng=20
broker=018, as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member =
Firm=20
or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)   Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its=20
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up f=
or=20
a customer=01,s account from an executing broker, provided however, that th=
e=20
executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the=20
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be=20
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice=
=20
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (=01&DK=018) a trade on=
ly if: =20
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of=
=20
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing=
=20
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for whi=
ch=20
the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for=
=20
rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions o=
f=20
Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred=
=20
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and=
=20
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. =
=20
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing=20
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1) Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once=
=20
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker=01,s clerk must:

(a) confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b) accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as=20
practicable; and
(d) transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as=20
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2. Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing=
=20
broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with=
=20
the broker=01,s obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remain=
s=20
responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules.

3.  Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member =20
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order=
=20
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the=20
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g) the account number;
(h) the brokerage rate;
(i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with=
=20
the executing broker for that account; and
(j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifi=
cs=20
of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time,=
=20
and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information=
=20
shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4. Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed=20
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in=
=20
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker=01,s discret=

reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  T=

=20
such rejection.

Marilyn,

Do we have some documentation from the City that shows the City of Long Beach 
with a "Inc." at the end of their name?  I have never seen a city with an 
Inc. at the end of their name before, that is a corporate thing, not a 
municipal thing...

Per my voicemail, attached is the assignment of the FPL trade.  If you could 
please attach as Exhibit A, the specifics of the trade and then fax the 
assignment to the counterparty.  When the counterparty faxes the signed 
Assignment back we will have to have it initialled by a lawyer since it is a 
contract, and send it up to me and I will get someone to sign it.

I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking at 
my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.  Some of us (I won't name names!) are 
hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and 
attached below are the recipes for the evening.  I will provide beer, wine 
and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with 
the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to 
prepare.

Laura Johnson (1)
Charles and Janice Thompson (2)
John Hagood (1)
Ann Hutson (1)
Henry and Alicia Goodrow (2)
Beryl and Ray Mack (2)
Tana Jones (1)

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church)
2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first 
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the 
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 
59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on 
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks
7.  My phone number is (713) 529-1038

Matt,

The only people that can have full view and edit capability are Legal and 
Credit (for legal/client confidentiality purposes).  Attached is the icon, 
which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to 
any Enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in 
the database except the legal and credit comments.  I will make a request to 
add the legal and credit people to get edit capability.  I think Denis 
O'Connell already had edit access, send him the link and let me know if he 
has edit access.  (you can just copy this link and add it to emails to 
people, however, I'm a little afraid it might not work from London, because 
it is just a shortcut, if it doesn't, you might need your computer people to 
create a shortcut link for y'all, let me know).

Back office - Gail Hill, Carol Findlay, Pavi Sail, Raju Dattini (inc access

Apologies for the confusion.

Matt
Edmund Cooper

Matt,

Back office should have access to insert confirmations comments.  Yumi Takei 
needs to be on the back office list (not the lawyers list) - Gail Hill and 
Carol Findlay also need to be added; you should also ask ask them whether any 
other back office staff need access to add coments.

Credit need to have edit access for inserting credit comments. 

Add Denis O'Connell and Paul Johnson to the lawyers list.

Note that I am the only person in London with delete capability.

Thanks, Edmund

Hi Tana-as discussed, here are the names of folks who need access to the swap 
agreements database (please forgive me if some included already have access.)
 Janet Wood, Michael Slade , Ian Brungs, Robert Quick, Justin Boyd, Michael 
Schuh, Martin Rosell, Yumi Takei, Mark Elliot,   Rahaul Saxena, Adam Duguid, 
Paul Simons, Marcus Von Bock

Read only access- Debbie Nicolls, William Morely , Chris Sloan, Diana 
Higgins, Hamish Skutt, Lindsay Edmunds, Rod Nelson, Anna Reich, Paul Maley, 
Minna Tapponen, Oliver Harrison.

Thanks for arranging and if you need any more info please let me know.

Ed- Is there anyone else who you think we should include?

Matt,

Justin Boyd, Mark Elliott and Paul Simons already had edit access to the 
database.  From London, Nicola Beales, Robert Quick, Tracy Foy  & Robert 
McGrory (is he in Legal?) already have edit access (also yourself & Edmund).

Are All the other People you have requesting edit access in Legal?

On read access, Rod Nelson from Credit already has Edit access from his days 
in London.  You can send all those other people the Link (if it works) and 
they should be able to get in.  If they are in Credit we will want them to 
have edit access because they can read the comments so they can see more 
detail about the negotiation.  And hopefully, input their comments about 
their negotiation to keep Legal apprised (we can always hope!).

In response to a RUSH request from Frank:

FINANCIAL TRADING:  El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. is approved to trade 
all financial products under with the existing El Paso Energy Marketing 
Company (now known as El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company) Master Agreement 
dated as of 04/20/95.  Such Master Agreement and the Transactions thereunder 
we assigned to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P, pursuant to an Assignment of 
Agreements dated as of 12/1/99.

Confirmation Desk:  with respect to weather confirmations, they should 
continue to follow the existing format of the El Paso Energy Marketing 
Company weather trades (changing the name, of course).

We are in the process of replacing the old "ERMS Style" Master Agreement with 
an ISDA Master Agreement and will notify you when the new agreement is 
executed.

PHYSICAL TRADING:  Approved for all products.  Global Contracts:  talk to 
Stacy Dickson about which contracts to use (EL Paso, Sonat or GTC).

EMERGING PRODUCTS.  Approved for all products.

POWER:  Not approved for trading.  All power trading should continue under 
the old El Paso Power Services Company entity until we receive documentation 
that evidences the approval of the assignment of their power  license.

No time out for Tana.

Every time I see a picture like this, I'm more ready to bring one of these
critters home, but I am sure J & L would put me out and change the locks,
too.

Do I have cat duty this month when you head to the wine country?

Notice # 01-162
May 11, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions

DATE:  May 11, 2001
===========================================================
Reminder
Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End of 
Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, 
for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading range for 
all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above 
(below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that 
this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price 
fluctuation limits then in effect):
Crude Oil  20 ticks
Heating Oil   50 ticks
Unleaded Gas   50 ticks
Natural Gas  50 ticks

 Clarification
Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the 
closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted 
the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the close, 
there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible to trade 
that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above, the 
post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an expanded 
version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the following 
clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded during a 
post-close session (on any day of the week):

1. Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading in 
the post-close.

2. If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session, it 
may not be traded during the post-close.

3. It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in 
order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the RTH 
session.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George 
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob 
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

Ian,

The confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to 
provide the agreement to affiliates.  I will need some direction from the 
counterparty either via email or phone before I can send you a copy of the 
agreement.  Sorry...

Hello Tana,

I was wondering if you could provide me with a copy of the ISDA in place with 
Alcoa Inc. today. It would be greatly appreciated if you could send this 
document either by email,  or to me by fax at 0207 783 1171.  Sorry about the 
rush on this.

Thanks in advance, 

Ian

I had a rush approval on this list, so while you were out having a baby 
(well, actually Louise was doing all the hard work!), I called Leslie at home 
at Elizabeth's direction because I had to get Sierra Pacific Holding Company 
approved.  We are currently purchasing power from them and Ed Sacks said we 
just gotten an EEI in place with them so Leslie approved them for both the 
bid and offer on west power (even tho Credit is going to open them up for 
purchases only).

No one has approved any other lists while you were out, so I have been 
patiently been waiting your return...sniff...sniff...

Can you please put this counterparty in profile manager for me.  We had a 
really old ERMS Master that restricted the types of financial products they 
could trade under it, and I want to take a look and see what we've got them 
approved for.  They should be able to trade any financial products now.  
Thanks!

On the ISDA replacement front, just a reminder that we want to put Morgan 
Stanley Capital Group at the forefront, we have an old Energy Price Swap 
Agreement in place with them, and then there's always our favorite, the old 
AIG "Master Master", now with Sempra, that raises a whole host of other 
issues...you were going to talk to Bill about that one...

Do you want me to put them on the list for the Legal/Credit meeting as a 
reminder?

As of this week EnronOnline has just started offering US/Canadian Dollar 
Swaps Online.  As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can 
transact these products online I look at the Financial Trading Agreement 
Database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master 
swap agreement, and I am also looking at any Board Resolutions we might have 
received when we got the master agreement executed. 

What I am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions 
evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative 
transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to 
enter into currency transactions.  Since transacting these currency 
transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us I 
just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to 
rely solely on the "Restrictions" contained in Lotus Notes.

We have received the following certificates:

1.  Certificate of Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on 
November 24, 1999, evidencing the name change, which is effective December 1, 
1999, of El Paso Energy Marketing Company to El Paso Energy Merchant-Gas 
Company.

2.  Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on 
November 24, 1999, evidencing the merger of Sonat Marketing Company L.P. with 
and into El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P.

3.  Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on 
October 25, 1999, evidencing the merger of Sonat Inc. with and into El Paso 
Energy Corporation.

Copies of these documents will be distributed.

You are absolutely the best!

FYI, following-up on this matter, after discussing the matter with their 
counsel and confronted with a $3.5MM lawsuit, Lakeside acknowledged the deal 
and executed our paper.  Regards, Peter.

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year 
fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM 
(US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by 
that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of 
Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was 
subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that 
basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on 
guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put 
in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the 
guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique 
who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good 
understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  
Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is 
currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good 
understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than 
Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired 
last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.

I think we should stick with the standard so people can cook it at home if 
they like it.

call. The customer will be liable for any loss or deficiency resulting=20
therefrom.

 (H) The margin requirements established by the Board or its designee may=

 (I) Arbitrage

(1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position=
=20
is a purchase or sale of an Exchange futures contract in one delivery month=
=20
which futures contract is offset by a futures contract to sell or to purcha=
se=20
a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different delivery=
=20
month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject to the=20
rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage position=
,=20
each contract long and short must be carried by the same member firm for th=
e=20

Below is the ISDA in electronic format as you requested.  This draft is 
several years old and if you are putting a new one in place I would suggest 
you start from the newest version of the form and just use this to use as a 
blackline version.

Hello Tana,

I have spoken with the lawyer from Alcoa and she is fine with us viewing the 
ISDA in place. In fact we already have a copy but I need it in Electronic 
format. If you could send an electronic copy it woud be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Ian

Is the counterparty known by the above ID Lyke Corporation or Ripon Community 
Printers, I'm confused?

Attached is the NDA for Cargill you requested.  At the direction of Mark 
Greenberg, I have added a non-solicitation clause.

We have received the executed Amendment executed as of 01/11/0, to the ISDA 
Master Agreement between ENA and the referenced Counterparty dated as of July 
13, 1994, This Amendment adds FX and Currency Option provisions.

Copies will be distributed.

How has the GCP been set up?

Hello Tana,

In answer to your question - - both. Ripon Community Printers is a Tradename 
for Lyke Corporation.

Is the counterparty known by the above ID Lyke Corporation or Ripon Community 
Printers, I'm confused?

I forwarded a guy down to Credit on 5/9/01 from the referenced counterparty 
who wanted to get an ISDA in place with us.  I told him he would have to 
speak to our Credit Dept. first, and from the tone of his voicemail it 
doesn't sound like he's heard from anyone.  Can you make sure that someone 
calls him so he doesn't call me again.  His name is Greg Bass and his no. is 
619/696-3177.  Thanks.

Is this an individual?

Anna's information is not completed and I bet her cost center is different 
from yours (company the same?).

I've got everyone's access submitted except Martin Rosell and Anna Reich and 
Oliver Harrison whose company codes and cost centers I will need.  Justin, 
Mark Illiott, Robert Quick and Paul Simons already had edit access into the 
database and does your assistant Nicola Beales who should be checking that 
when she approves counterparties for EnronOnline (although I don't think the 
UK agreement are currently up-to-date, although they need to be for 
EnronOnline, it will save her a lot of time).

I'm a little worried about your Credit people making changes.  When you 
approve Credit people, warn them that they are should not make any changes 
except to Credit comments.

Edmund will need to go in and add your Legal and Credit people to the 
Database Keywords as only he should have access to add Keywords.  You might 
want to get him started on that because you have a lot of people to add.  
It's taken me quite a bit of time get all these approvals done!

On or about 5/2/01we opened the above counterparty to transact Canadian/US 
Currency Swaps on EnronOnline (which they cannot transact under the old 
Master Energy Price Swap Agreement, they would have to transact udner the 
GTC).  After discussing this counterparty w/Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
the swap group, it appears that Sara has been talking to Morgan Stanley and 
Morgan Stanley does all its interest rate & currency business out of Morgan 
Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  We can keep Morgan Stanley Capital Group open 
for currency swaps, but if they don't trade currency swaps out of that 
company we'll know why.  Sara is already working on an ISDA Master for 
Capital Services for Gary Hickerson's group.

New NDA for the Online Team, this time relating to ecommerce and business to 
business strategies.  Any conflicts...

Mark,

Your header is wrong on the 4th page.  The other pages say "David Berberian"

Linda -

I have reviewed the below agreement that Stephanie forwarded.  It is 
acceptable.  

Please have Mr. Cosey sign the necessary originals and have them forwarded to 
me or to Tana Jones at Enron.  Our address is 1400 Smith Street, Houston, 
Texas 77002.  We will ensure countersignature by Enron.

If you should need anything, please call me or Tana (at 713-853-3399).

Mark,
Per our discussion last Friday, I am attaching a revised NDA which has your
proposed changes (not revision-marked) as well as the changes we propose to
make in additon to those (which are revision-marked).  The only
revision-marked changes are in the second paragraph regarding written and
oral disclosures.  After speaking with Linda Milfred (an attorney I work
with), we thought the change we made regarding oral disclosures is more
appropriate than what you and I discussed last week.  I will be out of the
office for the rest of the week, so:

1.   If the changes are acceptable, please call my assistant Maria Wheeler
and she can accept the changes and prepare originals for Jackson Cosey's
signature; or

2.   If the changes are not acceptable, please either call Linda Milfred at
(404) 676-6631 to discuss or leave a message for me and I will call you
back at the first of next week.

Regards,

Stephanie Allred

(See attached file: Enron NDA.DOC)
 - Enron NDA.DOC

So I don't forget when you get back, I just spoke to John Allario, and we 
either need to amend or draft a new NDA for General Motors to deal with some 
new business approaches Net Works is making with them.  We'll need to 
possible add in 3 other Enron companies, so when you get back give me a call 
and I'll bring my notes around and we can discuss this.

It depends on the sophistication of the counterparty.  I think Tembec is 
fairly sophisticated based on the resolutions from them I have already seen.  
For a counterparty that isn't, we have sample board resolutions we can send 
them, or we even prepare them for some counterparties because sometimes they 
can't even figure out how to fill in the blanks.

	Chris Gaffney
	05/17/2001 07:39 AM
		 
Tana - thank you for your messages.  I will advise Jan and Randy that in 
order for Tembec to do gas transactions under this ISDA, they weill need to 
provide us with a board resolution authorizing the same.  Do counterparties'  
typically prepare their own resolutions or do we provide them with a 
precedent?

Thanks
CJG

Andrea,

I had Mark Greenberg, an attorney that works on EOL matters, review Green 
Mountain's form of CA and he much prefers ours.  What he suggested is that 
you send the counteparty back our form and say something to the effect that 
EnronOnline has a standard form of Confidentiality Agreement we prefer to 
execute our form.  If the form meets with their approval we're golden.  If 
they don't like it have them call me (and I'll just refer them to Mark!).

Attached is our preferred form.

I wanted to forward you directions to my house for dinner this Saturday.  
Alicia left me a voicemail and also suggested you bring your friend 
Kimberly.  Please feel free to do so, the more, the merrier!  I hope you will 
be able to make it.  Everyone has responded yes, except John Hagood.

I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking at 
my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.  Some of us (I won't name names!) are 
hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and 
attached below are the recipes for the evening.  I will provide beer, wine 
and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with 
the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to 
prepare.

Laura Johnson (1)
Charles and Janice Thompson (2)
John Hagood (1)
Ann Hutson (1)
Henry and Alicia Goodrow (2)
Beryl and Ray Mack (2)
Tana Jones (1)

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church)
2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first 
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the 
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 
59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on 
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks
7.  My phone number is (713) 529-1038

They should be approved today.  They were on last night's list.

This is the response I got from Green Mountain.  

Tim Smith said you  had a form of confidentiality agreement you had sent to 
him.  We have  taken the time to prepare and provide you a confidentiality 
agreement which  contains substantive provisions that have already been 
reviewed by your counsel  in our other dealings.  Many of the provisions are 
very similar both  agreements.  Therefore, please have your counsel review 
that document as  soon as possible.

As long as we're all talking about vacations, I'm going to get mine on the

Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I

I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will return
it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it
fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to

Tom/Tana-

Genesis ventures migrated last night. The counterparty needs to be retouched 
on the 5 European products (read only) and also US Recycled ONP Physical 
(trade).  

I would appreciate it if you could revisit this counterparty when you get a 
chance.

Per the attached memo from Mary Cook, an attorney in the Swap Group, and our 
meeting with members of Global Counterparty where we discussed problems with 
utilities of cities not being clearly identified, may I suggest the we rename 
GPP 98029, Norwich Public Utilities, something like, The City of Norwich, 
Connecticut?(which state?), by and through its Public Utilities Department.  
(The city utilities are at the bottom of the list.)

Stephanie, we will also need them to resubmit their PA.  Cheryl, we may need 
to confirm how we want to set this counterparty up before Stephanie send out 
the PA.

Cordially,

to do so.  Is there any special place you want to go???

I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will
return
it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it
fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to
come by anyway to see what else you have done to it.

I will call Carol, too, if you don't care.

Breakfast at 10:00 sounds great!  Wherever you want to go...also, I need to
get my bike back from you, I might be doing some biking.  I've been
thinking about you.  Hope all is going well.

                    "Patti Young"
Miss Tana,

Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I
thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available.

I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at
10, or whatever...

Let me know.

Patti

We have received the originally executed Password Application and Amendment 
to Electronic Trading Agreement dated as of 1/5/00.  The originals are being 
walked down to you.

Another request for the EnronOnline Team.  Any conflicts?

Attached is "Annex B.doc" which we use to prepare Annex B which contains the 
credit provisions we attach to a Confirmation when such is requested for 
omnibus financial confirmations.  About mid-way through the US Annex B is 
about 4 selections of collateral annexes depending on whether the credit is 
one-way or two-way and whether the collateral requested is letters of credit 
only or letters of credit and cash.  Following that is form of letter of 
credit.  We have an Annex B form for US counterparties and Canadian 
counterparties.  I have attached both.   The law in Canada currently does not 
favor taking cash in Canada and WE DO NOT TAKE CASH (this obviously is quite 
problematic for us!).  Our current advice from Canadian counsel is that Cash 
must be perfected in a way similar to filing a UCC.  The Canadian and US 
lawyers are re-reviewing this situation and I will let you know when/if this 
advice changes.

Does a Credit Support Annex exist for transactions perfected on the long form 
(omnibus) confirmation?  Is there such an animal?  If you have something like 
that, can I get a copy?

Thanks again, Karen

Tana-

We have a few counterparties that have been in the work queue for a while.  
When you get a chance, would you mind taking a look at the counterparties 
listed below:

Cascades Inc.
Capital Paper Recycling, Inc.
Storm Mountain Publishing Company
Jeffrey Acquisition Group
Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd.
NLK Consultants Inc.
Plateau Forest Products, Inc.
Southwest Paper Stock Inc.

We also need to get together and go through the work queue again for a few 
old counterparties I still see on the list.  Give me a call when you get a 
chance and we can run through that.

Thanks Tana!

Hi

I just found your e-mail and decided to see if you actually read
them.  Actually I also have a request.  I want to put your name down
as having talked to you about a job at ENRON.  This is for my
unemployment benefits.  They theoretically say they can call contacts
but they never have.  Anyway, anyone I talk to about whether a job
might be available in their company is appropriate.  I will put down
that there is nothing available for me, as I assume would be the
case.  It looks like I will get the job at Landmark.  I will probably
be coming down for training soon.  I'll keep you posted on when.

Hi Tana,

We did have it set up in the system without "Inc." but I got a request from 
the settlements group to add "Inc." to the name.  I personally verified it 
with the counterparty, and changed the record in GCP.  Lexis-Nexis shows that 
it was incorporated in California in 1984 as Pacific Forest Resources, Inc.  
Yes, please fax the articles to 713 646 5797, so I can get this clarified 
once and for all.  

Thanks,

(like my address and phone number which I don't like to give out) and they 
won't accept the referral without it.

You Bet!!!!

Can I expect any kind of payback from my contractor for giving him such a
high rating?

Tana when you have a  chance could you do me a favor and go to
www.contractor.com and do a search for  contractor by name then enter my
name and then my company name will come up and  then click on the link to
rate this contractor. Then fill out the form and rate  your favorite
contractor and of course you must give me high  marks.

How are you  doing?

I do not agree and I am discussing this with Justin Boyd in London before I 
(or Justin) responds to this Counterparty.  Joe, can you take a look at their 
EOL trades and see if there is any particular reason why their trades might 
be taking more than 24 hours to get a confirmation out?  Thanks.

Glencore claims that the Governing Law in their EOL GTC's should be English 
Law.  Do you agree?

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

Tel: 44 20 7412 3190

Regards,

Debbie

Justin,

Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make 
sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to 
choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.

I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is 
one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you!

I don't know where we stand on reviewing the derivatives situation for the 
referenced counterparty, but Frank Davis with EOL just called and the 
counterparty is applying for a password, so he wanted to refresh his memory 
why we wouldn't open them up for derivatives trading.  I told him that we 
were just looking at their situation last week, and to give your name & # to 
the counterparty if they question why they can't trades derivatives.  It 
isn't clear to me that we're ready to change our opinion on them yet.

Thanks for the email.  Looks like we're not bad in getting their confirms 
out.  After I hear from Justin I'll give them a call, hopefully tomorrow.

FYI
	
	

Hi Debbie.  

I left a message for Miriam - but to keep you in the loop - I have researched 
our deals done
with Glencore Commodities Limited for the last four months, finding that 
every deal was faxed
T+1 except two instances where a deal went out T+2, and the three deals from 
last Thursday 
which fax failed on Friday( I've signed and sent them this morning.). 

Also, considering the time difference, ENA may fax out a deal on T+1 after 
Europe
has gone home, so the counterparty will not see the confirm till the morning 
of T+2.  

Glencore should also get themselves set up with back office user access to 
EOL, so they
can peruse their deals while awaiting the confirm.  

I have also sent word to our legal department asking them to look into 
Glencore's
governing law status.  

I'll convey this to Miriam when I speak with her.
Thanks,
Diane

Just something I noted as I got in to approve Edison Mission.  West power was 
also in the queue for approval.  We had previously had them approved for all 
power, and Credit had shut them down for power because Credit has been 
worried about their financial condition ala PG&E, but now is willing to open 
them up for all power.  I thought it was OK to open them up for all power 
since we had them open for all power before, but I just wanted to run it by 
you just in case...

Hi Tana

Thanks for the note.....!

I am looking for the original letter we signed with Glencore, but from my 
recollection, all we said to Gencore was that the choice of law under any 
master or other trading agreement between Enron and Glencore was unaffected 
by the choice of English law under the UK PA or ETA.  This of course is not 
quite the same as Glencore's view below!

Laurie/Nony,

I wonder if you can find out for me from the data base, what the status is 
with Mitsui Corp. ISDAs re all Enron companies?  

***************

Alan,

Mitsui Corp has hinted that it doesn't want to have separate ISDAs with 
separate Enron entities.  What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.  
Seems to me that from the customer's perspective, this makes sense.  I wonder 
what sort of internal issues this raises though.

Thanks all.

I told Paul Radous, the Credit guy that you had already said that these guys 
could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing 
license.  It perhaps might be possible for them to purchase US power only.  
If they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you 
a name and phone number of someone at Engage that you can talk to to get 
evidence of their power marketing license.

The agreement would be entered into by The Chase Manhattan Bank.  It is
expected that Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York will merge with and
into The Chase Manhattan Bank in October.  (Their respective holding
companies have already merged and operate under the name J.P. Morgan Chase
& Co.)  Chase's address is 270 Park Avenue, NY NY 10017.

I have 98% chance of complete cure!!!!!!  They are not going to take any 
lymph nodes at this time.  The surgeon said it didn't matter whether it was 
over my lymph nodes or not.  My surgery is outpatient on June 19th.  It was a 
"Clark's grade 2" out of a possible 5.  They are going to take more out of 
the one on my stomach also to make sure there are clean margins.  They took 
another mole off my arm but of course don't think it is a worry!  

Per our conversation, it appears that the two companies are going to merge in 
October?  Looking at Lotus Notes, I don't think we could pick two bigger dogs 
of masters to have in place.  I don't think we want either master to be the 
survivor master.  With Chase we have an old 1987 Interest Rate and Currency 
Exchange Agreement and with Morgan we have a Master Energy Price Swap 
Agreement.  Yuk, yuk.  If I had my druthers I say, LET'S START OVER.  I know 
it's far reaching, but maybe we could make it our goal to have this master 
replaced by October.  Do you think that's do-able?  Do we have a contact at 
Chase/Morgan we can start dealing with?  I'm going to add chase to the 
Legal/Credit list just as a tickler for us to get this thing rolling.

Much thanks!

Dear Legal Lady's

I would like to further reinstate my status of favorite Credit Person, I know 
as of late my status had been slipping and I must confess I have no one to 
blame but myself.  I want you to know that after a lot of deep thought and 
pondering of my potential status downgrade, I have resolved myself to pull 
from deep inside and work to maintain my status.  Although my mates in credit 
have provided some strong competition to remove me from favorite credit 
status, I am here to tell you that I am committed 150% to remain as your 
favorite credit person!!!!!

Yours Truly,
Russell

Now, that being said, my commitment is demonstrated by the submittance of the 
Sempra Energy Solutions Credit Worksheet.

Thanks again,
Russell

Whilst speaking to Koch about the Koch Hydrocarbons/Industries trades, they 
asked if they could get ISDA Masters in place with two other Koch entities we 
are currently trading with.  The two companies are:

Koch Petroleum Group L.P., Credit Contact at Koch is Arnold Lenz at (316) 
828-8479

Koch Refining International Pte Ltd. a Singapore company, Credit Contact is 
in Singapore and can be reached at  65 835 20 27 (I don't know if Houston 
Credit or London Credit wants to handle this, I looked in the Master Swap

Notice # 01-186
June 1, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain Securitie=
s=20
and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and COMEX Transacti=
ons

DATE:
June 1, 2001
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to=
=20
Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX=20
Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1,=20
2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit=
=20
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are=
=20
further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will ser=
ve=20
as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use o=
n=20
a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained from the=
=20
Exchange=01,s Clearing Department.

3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint=
=20
Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard=20
Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for Joi=
nt=20
Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used =
as=20
margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint=20
Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used a=
s=20
margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association =
as=20
one of the Joint Beneficiaries.

4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under =20
applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidia=
ry=20
or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing=
=20
House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank parent or=
=20
affiliate bank.

As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule=20
changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and=20
deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin=20
requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use =
of=20
such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions.

Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit (LCs=
)=20
now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a "pass-through" basis on bot=
h=20
divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able=
=20
to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. =
It=20
should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a=
s=20
detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m=
ay=20
not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin=
=20
obligations with the clearinghouse.

Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim=
e=20
on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer=
s=20
to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member=
s=20
on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the=
=20
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter=
=20
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve=
=20
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=
ne=20
issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20
value.

Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=20
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted=
=20
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =
no=20
more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)=
=20
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,=20
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice=20
President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.

(g) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account*, =

into consideration and combined with any other monies available, enable the=

customer's margin to equal or exceed the then prevailing initial margin=20
requirement.

 (F) Withdrawals of margin from a customer's account may only be permitted =
by=20

are equal to or in excess of the then prevailing initial margin required of=

se=20
a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different delivery=

month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject to the=20
rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage position=
,=20
each contract long and short must be carried by the same member firm for th=
e=20
same account.

(2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures=20
contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a differen=
t=20
exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an arbitrage position=
.

(3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for=20

All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder on Use of Money Market Funds as Original Margin Deposits on the=20
NYMEX Division

This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy=
=20
guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.=
 =20
The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division=20
allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for=20
purposes of original margin deposits.

Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved =
by=20
the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for the=
=20
COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date.

 Rule Amendments
The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose,=
 a=20
money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply=
=20
with CFTC Regulation o 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the Exchange=
=01,s=20
Clearing House will value such money market fund shares at 95% of their=20
market value.  In addition, a Clearing Member=01,s participation in any app=
roved=20
fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer shall be=20
limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member=01,s total=
=20
original margin obligations. Finally, no more than 25% of the total assets =
of=20
an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin=20
obligations at the Exchange.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional=20
guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further noti=
ce=20
from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of money=20
market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board will=20
require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a=20
minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for=
=20
same day payment if notification is made by 3:00 p.m. on that day.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)=
=20
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,=20
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Joseph Sanguedolce,=20

Debbie Brackett and I met this week and reviewed the various Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the 
division issue with respect to this counterparty:

The following entities exist in GCP:

1.  Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (GCP #36680):  We would like this entity to remain 
OPEN and to be renamed "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch 
Hydrocarbon Company Division". 
2.  Koch Hydrocarbon Company (GCP #57853):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appears to be one trade under this entity 
and this trade should me moved to GCP 36680.
3.  Koch Hydrocarbons Inc. (GCP #26197):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appear to be no trades under this entity.

With respect to the current financial trading being done by Koch Industries, 
Inc. (GCP #126) (not under a master agreement), I spoke to the Legal 
Department at Koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with 
Koch that will put all financial trades done by Koch Industries, Inc. under 
the existing ISDA Master Agreement we have with Koch Industries, Inc. acting 
through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  I will let you all know when 
such side letter agreement has been executed.

As soon as GCP #36680 has been renamed we can re-submit them to EnronOnline 
and open them up for trading.

I have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the 
"Other Agreements" subdirectory of the Financial Agreement Database.  That 
approval usually takes about a day, as soon as it comes through I'll let you 
know.  You will of course, still need to solve how to get into the directory 
with Mike Neves.  Let me know when you can get in.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional=20
guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further noti=

from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of money=20
market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board will=20
require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a=20
minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for=

Mark,

Can you please review the changes made by Susan Chang at Microsoft to the SQL 
2000 SP1 JDP MOU for our Unify application.  Bob Ward is out of the office 
until June 4th, and this application is going into production on June 11th.  
We need to ensure the MOU is finalized and signed prior to going into 
production so that we can receive the appropriate support from Microsoft when 
we go live.

If you need to contact Susan her telephone number is 425-703-6394.  Her email 
is schang@microsoft.com.

Thanks for your immediate attention to this matter,
Corinna Bolender
Desk: 713-345-4388
Cell:   512-632-4285

Bob and Corinna,
Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
change.  Specifically:
an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
(though this hardly matters now considering the date).
The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
#4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
good addition.
#10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
customer.

If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
included.  Please print, sign and return.

Thanks!
JamMo!

James - per our phone call this afternoon, I've revised the MOU.
Attached is the redlined version as well as the final doc.  Please let
me know if you have any questions.

Susan

Susan,
I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come
back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced.
Thanks for you help!

Hi, James.  I've attached a copy of the MOU which contains some minor
changes suggested by one of our attorneys.  Let me know what you think.
Thank you.

 Is O'Ryan Power Holding (formerly Duquesne Light Company) in the process of 
setting up an ISDA ?

Bob and Corinna,
Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
change.  Specifically:
an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
(though this hardly matters now considering the date).
The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
#4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
good addition.
#10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
customer.

If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
included.  Please print, sign and return.

Thanks!
JamMo!

James - per our phone call this afternoon, I've revised the MOU.
Attached is the redlined version as well as the final doc.  Please let
me know if you have any questions.

Susan

Susan,
I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come
back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced.
Thanks for you help!

Hi, James.  I've attached a copy of the MOU which contains some minor
changes suggested by one of our attorneys.  Let me know what you think.
Thank you.

A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up 
counterparties under division or trade names.  If the counterparties insist 
on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of 
the counterparty's name in GCP.   For non-swap team members, you may want to 
forward this email on to your groups as well. 
	Marilyn Colbert/ENRON@enronXgate
	06/06/2001 05:47 PM
		 
In accordance with the suggestions provided by Mary Cook in our Legal Dept., 
we have come to an agreement in regard to the naming conventions for 
divisions and trade names. For both divisions and dba/trade names, the 
counterparty name will be formatted to lead with the sub-entity name, 
followed by the parent legal name.

 i.e. division name, division of parent legal name  or  trade name, a dba of 
parent legal name

 Ex. Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy Corporation

This layout will make it easier to choose the correct counterparty name and 
avoid the misconception of duplicate records. Also the legal requirements 
will be met.

Please notify me by Friday, June 8th, if there are any issues with this 
format. Otherwise, the GCP group will commence using this proposed layout on 
current and future requests. 

Cleanup of existing records in GCP and Contracts will be accessed. In cases 
where the requested name could exceed the 90 character length maximum there 
will need to be an evaluation.

If there are any questions, please contact me @ 3-6517.

Thank you,
Marilyn

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching my list of North America 
"utility" counterparties.  My given task when I compiled this list was to 
identify "utilities" and determine if there was a reason we should not 
approve online trading for the counterparty.  We originally denied approval 
for all utilities unless we had a Master Agreement in place or an overriding 
commercial reason to transact.  We are now taking the position that investor 
owned utilities (IOUs) and related corporate entities should be approved for 
trading.  However, we will not approve online trading for governmentals or 
cooperatives when we do not have a master in place, so those counterparties 
identified as such do not need to be included in your review.  Obviously, if 
you are aware of a municipal or cooperative I failed to detect, please let us 
know.  In addition, your review does not need to extend to the Canadian 
counterparties.  We will run those by Canadian counsel.

Please review the list to help us identify the IOUs.  You may ignore the 
"Approved for Trading" column.

For your information, the list was compiled from information provided from 
our Credit Department, from the Company's financial statements which I 
obtained from EDGAR, from the Company's web site, from 
www.utilityconnection.com, or from web searches of the Company when I could 
not locate  information from any of the other sources.

Please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly.

You should have read access to our Financial Trading Agreements database=20
which should allow you (since you are in legal and can view the confidentia=

Per our earlier discussions, I am attaching the language we would like added 
to the definition of Index in the long descriptions for all US physical and 
financial pulp, paper and lumber products.  If you have any questions, please 
give Mark or me a call.

Justin, as an FYI, is this something you might want to add to your European 
products as well?

Per our meeting, we need you to (i) check whether you had "Total Premium" or 
"Premium" in your online confirmation, and (ii) give me some language re: 
online trading procedures for the confirmation procedures section.  Thanks!

Anthony,

Unless your questions relate to an online problem, can you address your 
master questions to either of the two Susans.  Thanks!

At the request of Carol St. Clair, I am attaching our form of EnronOnline 
Password Application, Electronic Trading Agreement, and a sample of each of a 
financial and physical online GTC.

We received a Notice from the NYMEX today that they have set March 2 as the 
date for power to go ex-pit.  I will send each of you a copy of the memo.  
Copies are also being immediately hand delivered to Jim Fallon and Tim 
Belden. 

 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an 
ISDA Master Agreement.  This Guaranty will supersede and replace the guaranty 
previously given to Counterparty (formerly known as Enserch Energy Services, 
Inc.) dated as of December 16, 1996.  We will need the standard executed copy.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of 
Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Checking your mail, a Confidentiality  Agreement came in from Greg Bruch, I 
gave him a call to see what his timing was, he said ite wasn't urgent, but if 
we could get an attorney looking at it, to get it final maybe next week.  It 
is counterparty's form, they would be the disclosing party, for a potential 
fiber source deal.  I am going to pass the agreement on to Carol for review, 
and will leave you a copy.

Why won't they let you go to the Corp. conference?  It's too bad, this new 
resort across the was from the Hyatt Hill Country where we stayed that last 
time it supposed to be even nicer.  Bummer!  It appears the ECT one is 
probably always going to be at the Woodlands Resort, which is real boring...

FYI

Cross Timbers Oil Company has requested that we consolidate our entire 
trading relationship at the above referenced entity.  They have also asked 
that we consider a netting agreement for margining purposes that will allow 
netting of not only financial and physical mark to market, but receivables 
and payables with the combined mark to market. They have offered a parent 
guaranty from Cross Timbers Oil Company to cover existing exposure with a 
built-in cushion to cover future transactions.

As I see it, there are several credit and legal issues within their request.  
First, is credit comfortable wearing the aggregate amount of exposure, and 
does an enormous guaranty from a BB- company get us there?  If so, is legal 
comfortable with the concept (as in Torch Energy Marketing's case) of an 
overall netting agreement across products, receivables, payables, and mark to 
market?  Finally, are we comfortable transacting with the entity that has no 
assets, but rather is simply backed by a guaranty.  

If we do figure out that we can accommodate their request, we will need to 
assign the master agreements and all transactions under the agreements from 
Cross Timbers Oil Company to Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc.  We will 
also need to amend the outstanding guaranty, extend its tenure and increase 
its amount.  

I will address the credit issues within our group, and I think we should try 
to schedule a meeting between legal and credit to discuss whether or not the 
netting agreement requested is possible.  I will make a call up to legal 
later this morning to compare schedules and try to set up a time to meet.  
Meanwhile, please call me with any questions, concerns or suggestions.

Regards,

John

Can whoever is working on the revised confirms for the referenced 
counterparty let Doug know the status?  Thanks!
My friends at BC Gas now have the ISDA amendment.  Thanks.  What about the 
revised confirms?

When you have a minute, I've been inputting data all week and have 
fixes/upgrades we need to the database.  In particular, the EOL people are 
about to introduce a new product any time time now, and I need that sort the 
shows "Approved, approved with limits, not approved" to work so I won't have 
to look at each of 1500 entries to determine what limits are in place.  When 
you arrive Monday can you let me know how long it will take you to have that 
sort working.  Then, maybe we can get together and discuss other changes we 
need to make.

Much thanks!

San Diego has applied for a Password Application and wants to trade 
financial.  Per them, they have already been trading financial off-line with 
us, and I check with the Confirm Desk and that statement is true, Craig 
Breslau has done financial trades with them (I thought they weren't allowed 
to trade financial?!).  Anyway, can we now open them up to trade financial?

Do any of the other trading groups have any masters in place with 
Transammonia, Inc. or any of its divisions, such as Trammochem, Trammo Gas or 
TrammoGas & Petrochemicals?  Can you let me know ASAP.  Thanks!

I am meeting with the exterminator tomorrow a.m.  He said he would arrive 
between 8-9 am, if he shows up more toward 9 I might not be back yet, if he 
shows up more towards 8, 10:00 will probably be fine.

This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues 
related to EOL trades with Aquilia 

The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team 
regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia 
Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia 
Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, 
Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been 
notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk 
will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the 
counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these 
were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed.  

Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) 
Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues.  

Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia 
Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the 
effort to getting the invoices to the correct office.  

I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia 
Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like 
clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for 
Physical deals.  

Thanks,
KC

Attached is the list for 1/24/00. 

 For the list dated 1/25/00 which only had one amended counterparty, First 
Energy Corp., I have a change in my earlier approval, from the Power Group.   
I don't have a code for this, so I'll just tell you, for this Counterparty 
Enron call SELL power only to them pursuant to an on-line GTC.  This 
Counterparty cannot sell to us via EOL.

It appears that you are signed up for this class, and the confirmation and 
approval should go to you & Scott.  Remember that you will be charged if you 
do not cancel if you are not going to go (and the charge for canceling is 
pretty high, about $1000.  There is no charge if you attend.  Also, let me 
know if you don't get the proper approval forms.

We have received the executed Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement between ENA

amends the Threshold levels in the Credit Support Annex.  Copies will be 
distributed.

We have no record of such an ISDA Master or any other financial master being 
in place with this counterparty.  Could it be drugs?!!

I hope you know I was joking with you...I was a little hesitant about sending 
that message...

I'm glad to hear from you!  I guess I'm a little confused.  I thought you 
were going to send me your form.  I would be happy to send ours.  I can draft 
one up in a jiffy.  Just let me know what you prefer.

P.S.  Isn't email wonderful!

The Lower Colorado River Authority has called and is ready to do financial 
business with us and wants to get a revised draft of the ISDA.  The credit on 
the draft I sent them before is quite old, so I need someone to get me new 
credit or tell me if the old credit is still ok.

Respectfully,

We are going to open San Diego Gas & Electric to transact the following 
financial products, but are going to limit the length of the trades to 3 
months or less.  The approved products per the Master Agreement are any 
"swap, cap, floor, collar or option...based on the prices of crude oil, 
petroleum products, natural gas, or electric power...".

I have previously not distributed the executed Master Agreement because of 
unresolved issues with the counterparty, but will send copies today to the 
usual distribution.  We have an executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement 
in place between ECT and the counterparty dated as of February 25, 1997.  All 
financial trades for this counterparty should go under the master.

Gracie,

Thanks for your help!

FINANCIAL:

We have an ISDA Master in place, originally through Transammonia, Inc., 
acting through its division Trammochem.  That master has since been expanded 
to allow trading through additional divisions, Trammo Gas Division and Trammo 
Gas & Petrochemicals Division.  All trades and confirms can be done as 
follows:

Transammonia, Inc.
Transammonia, Inc. acting though its division Trammochem
Transammonia Inc. acting through its Trammo Gas Division
Transammonia Inc., acting through its Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division

Obviously, Transammonia, Inc., the body corporate, needs to always be on the 
confirm.

PHYSICAL:

My reports from the other Legal trading groups are that they have no 
contracts in place, although it is somewhat unclear on the physical gas side 
as to whether Global Contracts as to whether we have any physical gas master 
in place.

Mark just had to run down quick to a meeting.  When he gets out we'll give 
you a call & go over this stuff.  We really appreciate your help!

If you are in Houston on Feb 10 and HAVE NOT PLANNED ON HAVING DINNER WITH

about that hotel by the airport, I'm gonna take it real personal if the only 
hotel room you can get this time is in Pearland.  Ya know what I mean...

Anyway, I have been thinking about you and wondering what you're up to.  For 
the Enron Corp. Legal Conference, real cool people (like me) are signing up 
for the raft trip, so as long as the weather's nice we're going to be

a few calls out to see if I need to restrict their access to Enron Sales only 
and will let you know in a bit.

Leslie

Here is my revised list incorporating Leslie Hansen's power comments.

Attached please find referenced list.  The only amended counterparty with a 
change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.  I wonder, when 
we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my 
prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?  Right now I have to go 
find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see 
if I have any problem with the change.  So usually, unless I have - change 
next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.  Does that 
make sens?

I am actually working on the pieces of the project, but the overall "system" 
still needs to be designed.  I've been working with our computer people to 
upgrade our master swap agreement database.  We will be capturing some 
additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the 
autoconfirm process.  Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating 
to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the 
database to all interested ENA employees.  

I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of.   
First is our" jurisdictional database", which will summarize the swap laws as 
they relate to each country.  Our international business is growing and its 
becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  I've actually got the 
database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start 
briefing the country information soon.

Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been 
online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the 
business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract 
information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and 
on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties 
we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We 
have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.

The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal 
advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, 
power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has 
in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them 
is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they 
want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among 
other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, 
all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from 
outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this 
Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being 
scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the 
documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents 
available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although 
compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might 
be more of a problem.

The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all 
these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces 
before the overall system. 

Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this.

Bob Klein from Salomon Smith Barney would like to arrange a conf. call

him that was OK and that we would call him.

I have been faxed a proposed form of assignment from El Paso with respect to 
certain trades transacted between 1/14 and 1/25 which they would like 
assigned to their affiliate, El Paso Energy Marketing Canada Inc.  I am 
having a messenger walk a copy down to each of you and need your direction as 
to whether we should consent to this assignment.

I have had to revise the list I provided to you earlier.  The change was 
shutting Kimball down for financial as well.

Shari, how do you want to handle this?
The commercial person from BC Gas called me today to complain about the 
securities rep and warrant that we put in the confirm.  I thought I had 
resolved this by having you guys amend the ISDA and then we could remove it 
from the confirms.  She now tells me their position is that the rep and 
warrant was not pre-negotiated and was not in place at the time they entered 
the trades so they will not sign any confirms containing the rep & warrant 
and further they will only "consider" signing the amendment.  I tried my best 
to explain that there corporation could be harmed if they did not make the 
representation and she seemed to be making a big deal over a non-commercial 
point and she was the only counterparty to complain but I got nowhere.  Is it 
possible to send them amended confirms without the rep & warrant before we 
here back from them about the ISDA?  This would make them happy and get off 
my back.  Let me know.

Thanks

Doug

I spoke to Howard Volz at CT Corporation today, and he said he sent the 
renewal to DAPSA in November (their renewal date is Feb. 1 of each year) and

Thanks for your email.  I don't want to state the obvious because you appear 
to already be in compliance, but just as a precaution, I want to make sure 
you are aware the ECT has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from 
trading in anything the company trades in.  Any trading you do for your own 
account must comply with this policy.  

I do not appear to be having a winning record for getting my approval list 
right the first time today.  Attached is also a revised list for 01/31/00.

I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade 
under the "Master Master"  for the referenced Counterparty.  It's not 
surprising, it's a confusing master!  This is currently the only agreement we 
have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial 
transactions in one agreement.

There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between 
ECT and  AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp. 
(Global Contract Reference No. 96000160).  This agreement provides for 
financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and 
further provides for physical natural gas transactions only.  It does not 
provide for any other physical products.

Mark and I were discussing my potential purchase of a car, and were looking 
at some web sites, and thought we would pass on the following car buying web 
sites:

www.edmunds.com (tells you what prices to pay for cars, safety records)

www.consumer.org (Consumer Reports Magazine Web Site, more to car safety, 
repair records)

www.carclub.com (if you go to "research advice", then click on "crash test 
results" they have some info on SUV crash tests.  Since y'all don't have as 
many SUV's on the road in England you may not know that some of them have 
failed the crash tests big time, and that also because their point of gravity 
is up higher they tend to rollover (or "tump" as we say here in Texas) when 
you make a sharp turn (like to avoid an accident).

Anyway, we were a little concerned about your safety...

You narratives aren't too long, I'm just giving you some grief!

master swap agreement database works, for us to keep track of our approvals

Application, ETA, GTC, or any other EOL documents.

I have been inputting the data for the Houston based Credit counterparties, 
and was wondering whether you want me to input the London based Credit 
counterparties or not.  I have no idea whether you've approved them or not, 
you'll have to input that data, or you could send it to me and I can input it 
for you.  Also, I don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial 
three big counterparty lists...But I know you are busy and it might be hard 
for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data, unless you 
have an assistant do that.

Anyway, we (me, since I'm the one approving all new counterparties for every 
Legal Group in Houston!) have been using it and are finding it very 
helpful).  It is also helpful for when I'm out so Mark Taylor can look to see 
whether I've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale I had for the 
approval (usually I only put in info when I don't approve a counterparty).  
Anyway, the link to the database is attached, so why don't you take a look at 
it just to see what I'm doing.

We're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data, so it's not 
fully operational yet.  Anyway, give me your thoughts...Don't make any 
changes, it'll screw things up...

Attached please find the referenced list.  As usual, no European power for 
U.S. counterparties until further ntocie.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated....!

As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to 
your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the 
following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from 
time to time).   We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next 
week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light 
of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark 
Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your 
attention.

 One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every 
financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.  
The Houston forms are currently located in a "read-only" directory.  We need 
to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they 
use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use 
creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms 
evolve without  approval.

Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is 
when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap 
agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation 
change, if you make it in every agreement.

Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily 
accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical 
component of the Fishkin Project).

Thanks for your attention to this.

Would you like to set up a time to chat?  My calendar is pretty clear this 
week, except for tomorrow at 2:00 pm.

We wish you the best for your vacation!  I hope the rest of the Credit Group 
maintains the high standard of diligence and promptness that you have 
established.  

I haven't heard back from you about my EOL database.  I will hope that your 
lack of response means that you are busy, not in disapproval of my lovely 
database...

Attached please find the referenced lists.  

We have no changes to the amended counterparties, so the only counterparty 
really with a comment is Westcoast Energy, which we have not approved for 
power.  Of course, no European power for US entities until further notice.

My Apartment:

1.  Fix leg on sunroom denim couch
2.  Fix front of dresser drawer in back bedroom that is falling off
3.  Front door - handle is loose
4.  The window in the back bedroom behind the bed is missing trim.  I think 
the trim is in the closet in the living room.  The blinds won't be right if 
we don't get that trim in.

Downstairs Apartment:

1.  Fix broken window in front bedroom
2.  In bathroom, piece of wood has fallen off cabinet
3.  In bathroom, towel rack is broken.  Can you replace?
4.  Peter says ice cube maker won't shut water off when is on, so he just had 
it off
5.  Nancy said front door handle is loose
6.  Do we have any drips in sinks?

The floor refinishers will show up Monday morning.  They are going to 
refinish downstairs floors and my back stairwell.

I would like to recarpet upstairs.  Where do you suggest I go to get new 
carpeting?

Two emails and still no response...was it something I said?!

Can you change it on my calendar.  Thanks!

Attached please find the referenced list.  Since all the counterparties are 
amended counterparties, my changes are as follows:

1.  Statoil - no change in earlier approvals

2.  Texla -  I don't think it's a change, but they cannot trade US power, 
also there is no change for financial, I previously said and we continue not 
to trade financial.

3.  Avista Corporation- Washington Water Power Division.  For financial 
trading for Avista Corporation I previously said no financial trading.  I am 
going to open them up for all financial trading.  They can trade under the 
Avista Corporation name, or they can trade as Avista Corporation, acting 
through its Washington Water Power Division.   For power trading,  they can 
trade all US West power products, but can Enron can only sell to Avista for 
US East power products.

Again, no European power for US counterparties until further notice.

Just a reminder to talk to Tim Belden...

You are the woman!

I have not heard back from DAPSA with respect to the Consent to Service of 
Process.  Can your business contact there give them a call?  Thanks.

Per my conversations with John Suttle in Credit, I am opening up the 
referenced counterparty to trade all financial products.

Just a reminder...to talk to Tim Belden....

Why do we have two active masters?!  Because it appears that Synder/Santa Fe 
merged and Susan B. did not handle to multiple master issue!

In looking through Lotus Notes for EOL, it appears we have two active masters 
for Santa Fe Snyder Corporation.  Does anyone know which one is the active 
master?

The master agreement for this counterparty appears to not cover the Trade 
Option Exemption.  Are we adding that into confirms?

When would you like to discuss utilities...?

I went through our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and determined 
that the following masters do not permit power:

The Bakersfield Californian    newprint only
Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG   no commodity transactions
CGAS, Inc.      natural gas only (are currently shut down for trading because 
authority certificate only covered one trade)
Coastal Gas Marketing Company   natural gas transactions only
Credit Lyonnais New York Branch (AAA Program) no commodity transactions
E.W. Scripps Company (The)    48.8 gram newsprint swaps only
Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc.   no commodity transactions.  Weather 
is ok
Mellon Bank NA     FX and currency option transactions only
Midland Bank plc     FX and currency option transactions only
National Westminster Bank    FX and currency option transactions only
Palladium Insurance Limited    weather only
Phibro, Inc.      energy price swaps based on fixed and floating prices of 
natural gas, crude oil or oil products and/or call        and put options 
based on the prices of natural gas, crude oil or oil products

Praxair, Inc.      natural gas only
PXRE Corporation     weather only

National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh P.A.

New York, NY 10270
Attention:  Mr. David Fields

Fax No.: 212-269-2480

We'll have to invoice them for a deal, so please set up a financial link as 
well.

Many thanks,

Please find attached the referenced list.  For Enserco Energy, Inc., my 
previous approvals remain the same except for power, which has been shut down 
for trading (I can't just copy the last excel spreadsheet since the columns 
are not in the same order anymore).  Then, the only other new counterparty is 
also shut down for power but open for everything else.

We need to amend the master on Williams, and Mark asked me to see you about 
it because this type of amendment might have to be made to a number of 
counterparty masters.  When you have some time, can I come around...Thanks...

I went through our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement Database and determined

I will attend.

I have received executed copies of the following assignments of certain EOL 
trades (physical and financial):

1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and 
among Aquila Risk Management Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy 
Marketing Corporation ("Assignee") and Houston Pipe Line Company

2.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and 
among Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Risk 
3.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of December 29, 1999 by and 
among Aquila Canada Corporation ("Assignor") and Aquila Energy Marketing 
Copies of these assignments will be sent to the usual distribution group.

The EOL trade assignment letters are prepared off the same form we do our 
regular assignments.  There is no special language in the assignment form 
about online issues.

Attached are the Swap Group's form of Enron Corp. and Counterparty 
guarantees.  Erica, these forms are located at atty.fms/swaps/current 
forms/guaranty.doc.

I'm ready for a real challenge...!

It is always my pleasure to help you and Babs!

What the latest with Force?  Should we proceed with this amendment...

Team,

Can we please amend the collateral threshold in the draft ISDA for the above 
referenced counterparty?  The new collateral threshold amount should be 
$2,500,000.  No other changes are necessary to the document and I hope 
therefore that a full credit worksheet will not be necessary.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Fred is looking for this asap, so 
if we could have it to him by noon or so tomorrow, he will be quite 
appreciative.

Thanks,

John

 

I have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated 
as of May 25, 1999.  This amendment deletes the prior Confidentiality 
provision in the ISDA Master Agreement and replaces it with our current 
Confidentiality language.  This change will allow either party to provide 
copies of the agreement to its Affiliates.  Copies will be distributed.

Team,

It has been brought to my attention that a worksheet for the above referenced 
might not have sent in the first place.  So, I am attaching a worksheet, and 
as usual, if you have any questions, please call me.  I will more than happy 
to receive and if necessary, RETURN your call.

Thanks,

John

With this attitude, you are sure to work up in the standings of being our 
favorite Credit person...

The referenced counterparty is approved to trade all products except power.

I do believe you can look up who is working on this master in Lotus Notes...

Greg, check with Nella or Peter.  The ISDA 1994 Credit Support Annex should 
be contained in the binder I gave Peter during his secondment here in 
Houston.

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 15, 2000 
amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement.  Copies will be 
distributed in the usual manner.

And you just know I just hate to be right...!

Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note the following:

1.  For Puget Sound, no change in our earlier approvals except for power.  
For power, open for West products, but ENRON SALES only for East products.

2.  For Ferrell International Limited, Credit shows them as an amended CP, 
but I have no record of seeing them before, so I treated them as a new CP.  

Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties.

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 8, 2000 
amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  
Copies will be distributed in the usual manner

I spoke to Mark Taylor today and he said that he spoke this week with a 
lawyer from, I believe Skadden, that had been hired by the OMLX to talk to 
ED&F Mann about the CFTC issue.  I think Mark Taylor is waiting to hear back 
from the Skadden lawyer.

We have received the executed  Letter Agreement dated January 25, 2000 
amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with respect to the referenced 
Counterparty.  Copies will be distributed in the usual manner.

We have received fully executed copies of the following assignments of 
physical natural gas transactions:

1.  Assignment of Various Natural Gas Transactions by and between El Paso 
2.  Assignment of Various Natural Gas Transactions by and between El Paso 
Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and Enron Canada Corp.

Copies will be distributed.

Thanks for following up with this!  It is critical we have accurate 
information on our positions.  Continually busting our limits could subject 
the company to potentially substantial fines from the NYMEX.  Please let me 
know what Mike's thoughts are...

Oh, you little sweet talker...!

Here are the details on the LV Cogen change so that you can get it into the 
system.

We are going to amend the Gas Swap confirm referencing the Inside FERC 
Natural Gas Week (Ref Deal No. N02595.1).

The change will be to delete the floating price reference to Inside FERC NW 
Pipeline and change it from Inside FERC NW Pipeline to the Natural Gas Week 
Opal( Ref Deal No. N02595.2).  This will make the two confirms for 2500 
MMbtu/d match each other.  The Fixed price component basis on the revised 
confirm will change from <$0.28> to <$0.27>.

We are currently working on a confirm.

Let me know ASAP if you have an issues with the change.

No, I didn't get it.  Just reply back to this email & reattach it.

Can we do a "See" dropdown like the Master Swap Agreement Database, so we can 
track name changes?  Thanks!  

As a follow-up to our conversation, the referenced counterparty is not an 
eligible swap participant, therefore we need to shut them down for all 
financial.

What do you think about the situation below?

Pan Canadian Energy Services has the following request:

For all EOL traded deals they do not want to recieve the Annex A that is 
attached to our Omnibus-EOL templates.  They claim that since they have 
already signed off on the GTC in order to trade on EOL, then they do not want 
to repeat any work and have to review an additional GTC when we send them a 
Confirmation.  Is it possible to exclude any Annex A (GTC) when we send an 
Omnibus Confirmation for trades done on EOL?

Legal contact @ PanCanadian is Rick Tucker @ 713-331-5049

Thanks,

Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  On Encal, the only 
amended counterparty, I don't know if this is a change or not from the prior 
approval, but Leslie shut them down for power.  All other prior approvals for 
that counterparty should remain the same.

Let me know what you think...I may go do my "long" run on Sunday, if you're 
doing one too, maybe we can meet for breakfast...

What are your thoughts on this...

     Can you provide me with some quick information?

 My traders entered into a transaction with the above group via London and I
need to scurry to get the ENRON CORP. PARENT GUARANTY AMENDED TO INCLUDE THIS
ENTITY (provided I have the correct name).

Do I have the correct entity name? Can we do AN AMENDMENT TODAY? I would like 
to
get it amended today so as not to have to break the trade?

In addition, if you could give me the Legal Contact Person in London for the
above named entity with phone and fax numbers it would be very helpful.

If you can assist, thanking you most kindly in advance. With kind regards.

Attached is the referenced list, with the following comments:

1.  BC Gas Utility Ltd. was added as an amended counterparty by me.  We got 
the financial master in place with them so we are opening them up for all 
financial.
2.  Ferrell North America - we have a financial master in place with 
Ferrellgas, L.P., d/b/a Ferrell North America.  That should be the name that 
goes out on the confirm.

All the counterparties on today's list are shut down for power.

What if there is no specific job.  I spoke to Mary Solmonson in Global 
Contracts and she said they had several job offerings and to send the resume 
to her and she would take a look at it and forward it to the relevant groups?

EOL needs to hear ASAP whether Nicor Gas Company is approved to trade

Hi,

Per Bob Bowen's request, I have attached the Special Handling List.  Please 
let me know if I can further assist you.

Sheetal Patel :)

 

At our Group meeting this past week we discussed paying the consent to 
service of process ourselves, just so we can make sure it stays in place, 
since it's not such a large amount of money.  Sara Shackleton is heading down 
there next week and was going to discuss this with you...we just wanted to 
give you a head's up about our thinking on this.

Linda and I had a good visit Sunday for about six hours.  We had a nice lunch 
at an outdoor cafe, went shopping in the Village, and then went back to my 
house for a chat.  Linda had pictures of Jenny.  She is a beautiful 14 year 
old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was 
voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and 
Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed 
for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.  
Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But 
she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought 
her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life. 

I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal 
Conference.  We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night 
and we're all a bit excited about that.  Then Thursday night is our big night 
out at a blues club.

This email was a good idea.  Linda got my address and I hope to be chatting 
with her more than every two years!  I'll be in touch when I get back.   All 
my love, 

We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross 
Border) executed 04/08/99, effective as of 06/09/98.  Copies will be 
distributed.

We also received the originally executed Confirmation, Deal # EM3927.1,2 & 
3.  I will sent it down to the Confirmation Desk.

Dear Mr. Zunic,

Pursuant to the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am attaching a sample form of our 
Master Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529 
if you have any comments or questions.

With respect to the referenced lists, all the counterparties on these lists 
are amended counterparties and there are no changes to our earlier approvals.

FYI, Credit did not have Ionic Energy down as an amended counterparty, but 
per my conversation with Tom Moran, it was on the initial second list, and 
should be treated as an amended counterparty. 

Below is the new drop down I need added:

Trade Option Representation (choose one only):

 standard
 weather included
 enron must be offeree
 none
 other

Mike, the above should have a box to check, and the box should always check 
"standard" unless someone goes in and effectively changes it.

Then add the following:

Other trading provisions

 pulp & paper
 FRABBA

Switching databases to the EnronOnline database:

We need to add a category for a new product, Credit Derivatives, have a 
comment box just like financial or power, have it follow after power.

This will confirm our conversation today regarding which European 
jurisdictions are approved for trading credit derivatives:  the U.K., Sweden, 
Norway, Finland and Switzerland.

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and 
The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it 
may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Per our conversation, Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit 
derivatives.

Greg,

It appears we send Dynegy Canada a draft ISDA in July of 1999, and got no 
response from them.  We will need to update the ISDA we sent them in July 
since our form has changed since then.  Once we get the go ahead from John 
Suttle in Credit as to whether we need to update the credit, we will prepare 
the ISDA Master Agreement you have requested.

My pleasure...!

There are no changes from my previous approvals for the two counterparties on 
this list.

No, they never gave me an updated copy.

It appears this class is on a Sunday & a Monday.  Did I get this right?

Per my conversation with Credit, it appears there are two Northern States 
Power Companies.  We have already reviewed Northern States Power Company, a 
Minnesota corporation (cpy ID #265).  The counterparty that showed up on 
yesterday's list is Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation 
(cpy ID #161).  The Wisconsin corporation is a sub of the Minnesota 
corporation.

I don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals...

With the execution of the Wisconsin Gas Company master, this brings the total 
executed financial masters to 400.  The countdown to 500 executed financial 
masters is now starting!  Congratulations to the Legal and Credit teams for 
getting us to this point and for a job well done!

Leslie,

Why am I getting this information below?  These counterparties are not on my 
approval lists for the last few days.  Did Frank ask you questions re: the 
counterparties below, and you just want me to put this info in the EOL Legal 
Database?

Leslie Hansen

Frank:

1.  Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership is not authorized to 
trade any U.S. power products.  (We are currently in litigation with Midland 
and are not trading with this CP.) 

2.  Otter Tail Power Company -- Enron Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  
We do not have any trading agreements with this CP so it is not necessary to 
send an override letter.

3.  Florida Power Corporation and Carolina Power & Light Company -- Enron 
Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  Each of these CPs should receive an 
override letter in the form attached below.

Call me with any questions at *36121.

With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with, 
do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "eligible swap participant" 
equivalant rules?

Rick Tucker at Pan Canadian (he used to be at PG&E) called and has been 
speaking to Willie Harrell on the Confirm Desk, and I believe Willie spoke to 
Mark about this issue yesterday, but it appears to be unresolved and I think 
Mark was going to talk to you about it.

Pan Canadian is doing EOL trades, and wants to know why he keeps getting the 
online confirms w/the GTC's attached since the way the system is set up he 
technically is already agreeing to the GTC's online.  He feels he is having 
to look at a lot of unnecessary paper.

Rick will be out of the office Friday and Monday, but was hoping you could 
give him a call Tuesday to discuss this issue.  His phone # is 713/331-5049.

FYI, we do not have a master in place with Pan Canadian Energy Services.

Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:

Tampa Electric Company can do power sells only.  Even though Peoples Gas is a 
division of Tampa Electric, it cannot trade power because its power marketing 
license was not granted in that name.  Further, I earlier shut down Tampa 
Electric Company for financial trading, and I am now opening them up for 
financial trading, either as Tampa Electric or Peoples Gas.

I am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a 
minute ago with Lori Volpi at Dynegy Canada.  As we discussed, Dynegy Canada 
is trading with both ECC and ENA, with the bulk of its trading being done 
with ECC.  Instead of getting two ISDA Master Agreements in place, we will 
enter into an ISDA Master Agreement between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and then 
just back-to-back any ENA trades down to Houston by virtue of the Services 
Agreement for Financial Agreements we have in place between ECC and ENA.   
Per my conversation with Lori, this will also work with the EOL trades since 
the Electronic Trading Agreement provides that any financial trades done for 
either ECC or ENA will be transacted under the respective master agreement in 
place with either ECC or ENA.

Works for me...!

Brenda Whitehead prepared that presentation and should be sending it to you.

I would be more than happy to update the database with any comments you may 
want me to add, don't ever feel bad, when I don't expect something I just 
need to know what it's about.

I hope we can open the EOL Legal Database soon so you can update any comments 
or notes directly into it.

In response to your email:

1.  The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just 
completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received 
the application by Fedex Thursday.  It will take several days for them to 
process his application.  Further, he still needs to attend their training 
session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade 
online.

2.  As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX 
ACCESS at a time.  I have a call into the NYMEX about this.  We get a 
terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no 
cost.  The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members 
and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, 
cost free for the first 6 months.  After 6 months any cost associated with 
the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.  I have a call into 
the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.

3.  Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the 
ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal 
operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently 
Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.  Any changes with respect to operators will 
have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process 
should continue to be done through the Legal Department.

Below are the account numbers at Salomon Smith Barney that you will need to 
trade NYMEX ACCESS power:

PJM  017 90327
CIN  017 90316
ENT  017 90317
PV  017 90404
COB  017 90405

per his note, it appears you should make a note to review the credit prior to 
approving any future trades.
Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
03/07/2000 07:40 AM
I spoke to Gabriela and so long as there are no live trades we should just 
put this master on inactive status.  If the counterparty were ever to want to 
do another trade it would be conditioned upon obtaining another process 
agent.  Gabriela also feels that any further trading with the counterparty 
should be pursuant to another credit review since control of the company has 
changed hands.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks.

At our Group meeting this past week we discussed paying the consent to 
service of process ourselves, just so we can make sure it stays in place, 
since it's not such a large amount of money.  Sara Shackleton is heading down 
there next week and was going to discuss this with you...we just wanted to 
give you a head's up about our thinking on this.

Gracie,

My confirmation of the class showed the 8/8 and 8/9.  You may want to go in 
and check your schedule.

I had Calpine Power Services Company shut down for financial, and we got the 
master in signed, so I am going to open them up.  Can you add them to 
tomorrow's list.

Thanks!

I don't know what list you are working from for your approval of credit 
derivatives, but attached is the list EOL sent me.  Many of the 
counterparties on the list are London based credit counterparties, and I will 
not be reviewing those, but I thought you might want to take a look at this 
to see if it's jiving with what you're looking at.  When I'm done (probably 
some time at end of the day since I just got the list yesterday and it's due 
today!), I will be emailing my approvals to Mark Dilworth in London.

Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.

To confirm our conversation, can you add "Credit Derivatives" as a new 
products to my database.  We will need the same drop downs as the other 
produsts (gas trading, financial trading, etc.).

Thanks!

I am aware that you need a list from me, I am working on it right now.  I 
just got the list from EOL yesterday and I'm reviewing it as fast as I can.  
My goal is to get it done by the end of my workday, so you should have it 
when you arrive in the morning.

There should be no question of duplication of ISDA Master Agreement or any 
other master swap agreements between Houston and London, because Houston's 
ENA and Enron Canada Corp. can do business under each other's masters because 
the tax reasons that used to require us to separate out the business went 
away.  Further, Houston and Canada subsequently entered into a Services 
Agreement which sets forth the conditions upon which they can act on each 
other's behalf (necessary for tax and legal reasons).

Below is the list of the final work we need you to bid on for the downstairs 
apartment:

1.  Paint inside of bathroom cabinets
2.  Paint outside and inside of kitchen cabinets
3.  Fix bottom of drawer of kitchen cabinet located right of dishwasher
4.  Replace closet rod in front bedroom to match other closet's rod
5.  Hammer down shelf ends that are loose in closet in back bedroom
6.  Clean ends of door hardware that have drips on them.
7.  Rehang blinds (we'll have to buy new hardware for existing blinds and 
then I will have to buy new blinds if any were bent by the kids)

Did I catch everything?

and those files will be moved and if unclaimed eventually gotten rid of.  Can 
you have someone come

Mark says I need to talk to you about the Credit Derivatives confirmation 
process...

Please add TXU Energy Trading Company to list.  We had an old style "ERMS" 
master in place, so they weren't allowed to do power, but now we have an ISDA 
in place (even tho' Brant Reves threw out the new guaranty, but that is 
another story!), so I am going to open them up for weather.

Dear Justin

Marly asked me to respond to you.

As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many
companies. Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word
ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to
prevent others from using the word ONLINE.

Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which
covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities),
I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably
unnecessary. However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service,
that should be registered.

I hope the above is clear.

Jonathan Day

Marly,

If you could respond to me on this request, thanks

I believe we are to some extent already protected with "Enron" proceeded
with
anything, but EnronOnline(TM) , etc. just affords us more protection.  I
assume
this is akin to why McDonald's trademarks "Mc"Everything?
David Forster

Paul,

Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking?

i.e. Are we covered if we proceed a word with "Enron"?  e.g.: EnronEAuction.

If we are covered, then was it necessary to register EnronOnline?

Thanks,

Dave

You are the best!

Why does it always have to be my deals...?!!!

We've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX  Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 
5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan.  The cause of this celebration 
is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract.  It would be nice if 
Shankman and John Arnold could attend.  Perhaps you can give them a personal 
invitation...

We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, 
which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add 
the rep into every confirm.  BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, 
and this has caused much difficulties.  I am going to count it as signed, 
since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC.  Can you 
get it signed ASAP and back to me.  Much thanks.

We have received the executed  Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with 
WeatherTrade, Inc. dated March 2, 2000.  This Amendment amends the 
Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph (c) of the Fee Schedule to the 
Subscription Agreement.  Copies will be distributed.

Updating another blue file because Susan B., this time, has not updated it to 
reference mergers & name changes!

It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the 
freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.  I didn't 
either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.  When you have 
a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to 
unfreeze the panel.

I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the 
confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding 
is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.  I communicated that 
to Bob Bowen.  He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to 
deal with the Credit Derivatives business.  Wow!

ISDA has published the referenced supplement.  Among other changes, the 
supplement adds hundreds of new gas, liquids and power price sources.  Copies 
will be distributed to you.

Attached is the referenced list.  Some comments:  We got a master financial 
agreement in place with Calpine Power Services  Company so it has been opened 
up to trade all financial.  Also, we replaced the old style "ERMS Master" 
with an ISDA, so I am opening TXU Energy Trading Company for all financial 
products as well.

For Trammo Gas, we got a letter from them a while back, reflecting under 
what  names they can do financial trading under (I sent you all an email 
about this about a month to two months ago).  That letter had the 
counterparty styled "Transammonia, Inc. acting through its  Trammo Gas 
Division".  I believe I already siad they could trade financial under that 
name.   Let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions...

David,

I know we've met before on your visits to Houston, I am a paralegal in the 
ENA Legal Department, in the Swap Group under Mark Taylor.  I am the lead 
contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues 
for EnronOnline.  I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group 
(financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and 
Credit teams.

I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve 
financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from 
Friday.  Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already 
trading).   I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, 
we might have for financial trading in Australia.  Are there any restricted 
counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or 
any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading 
financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time).   Have 
your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?

Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to 
trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole 
range of EnronOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the 
form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North 
American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we 
need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and 
arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?  Are there any issues we 
need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) 
with respect to a trade?

Thanks for your help!

I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.  They are due the end of 
July, so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier, since we 
always seem to need more time.

Sheri,

I need the trade date so I know what to date the termination.

I sent the documents to Paul Davis on March 6.

Actually, bluebonnets bloom for a short time, maybe three week early in the 
Houston Spring, in March, after heavy Spring rains have gone on for a bit, 
and when the temperature is in the 60's to 70's.  They would get fried and 
fade in the heat of a Houston summer.  However, I don't know the temperatures 
and rain condition of your summers, and what time of your year would 
replicate those conditions.

Per my conversation a minute ago with the Koch lawyer in Kansas, Tye Darland, 
"Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc." is a bad name.  The correct legal name for this 
counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our Master Swap Agreement 
database:  "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Division".  I have called the Koch trader, James "Doug" Peters 
(713/544-5938, ext. 5602) , and asked him to resubmit the Password 
Application with the name corrected.  Please show this correction in your 
records as well.

Please take me off your distribution.  I already bought my new car.  Thank 
youl.

I understand from Mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade 
financial, we will need to amend the GTC's to add some additional reps and 
provisions.  Do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that?

Molly Harris

Did you forget something in your email?

Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.

1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason 
prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the 
products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the 
contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the 
particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently 
opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian 
financial power.

2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?   
Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties 
too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts 
on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they 
are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not 
approve the London based counterparties.

3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every 
confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need 
to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding 
that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so 
we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.

FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the 
counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by 
London when they arrive for work Friday morning.

As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for 
approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty 
list.  Thinking through this product today and reading through my various 
emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no 
particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my 
thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved 
financial power product.  I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to 
me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.  What do you think?

The list I am working off of is the list generated for Credit Derivative 
approvals (which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have 
been issued passwords).

Mark Taylor, who is in Amsterdam this week, just left me a voicemail 
reflecting a conversation he just had with Dave Forster, and asked me to 
relay the following information to you (don't kill me, I'm just the 
messenger)...

With respect to your form of online GTC:

It need to be revised, per Dave Forster by Monday, to be expanded to include 
the provisions necessary that will enable a non-Australian based counterparty 
(a counterparty could be U.S., Canadian, European or other country based), 
who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place, and may or may not 
have credit in place, to do a financial power transaction with Enron 
Australia.  In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online 
"Deemed ISDA" GTC (for a weather transaction, the only type of financial 
transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own 
form of confirmation). 

As you can see when you look at our "Deemed ISDA" form of confirmation, there 
are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation 
includes, such as authority and tax representations, "arm's length 
transaction" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section 
2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting "in respect of the same transaction"), 
no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and 
understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations, 
definition of "Transaction" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms, 
"Website" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we 
usually say "Loss" instead of "Market Quotation", also,  Market Quotation and 
Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we 
need the word "integrated" with respect to the rerenced that the documents 
contain a "single agreement" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap 
protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our "severability" and 
"setoff" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions, 
business day defined as Sydney only, etc.

Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or 
will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely 
counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in 
place.

I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax, who is out of town today and was going to 
talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow.

After all the above, I just have to say...we really do appreciate your help 
resolving all these issues...

Debbie,

Thanks for the heads up on this.  I've been trying to get David Minns for 
several days about various issues.  Keep me posted.

I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara.  
Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have 
been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.  It appears the date Fred 
signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing 
contractual documents without Legal's initials.

There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us:  
(1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the 
settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.

Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some 
confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this 
with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more 
after lunch.

On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were 
changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign 
off on that change.  She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him 
to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.

Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference 
Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on 
too.

Are you also working on this?

So that's what's going on...

Per an earlier conveersation with Dave, ee weren't quite sure if you have 
seen a listing yet of all of the products we offer online, so I am sending 
you one of our excel spreadsheets which has at the top of it all of the 
products we offer, as well as the Enron entity that a counterparty would 
enter into the trade with.  

	
	                           
	

The attached spreadsheet contains the Online counterparties with execute IDs 
that Credit has tentatively approved for Autralian power trading, pending the 
confirmation of the European counterparties by our London credit group. 

This approval is contingent on the confirmation by our Australian counsel of 
the "specific criteria" which regulates with whom we can trade  and the 
proper forms of GTC and confirmation. 

Attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial Australian 
counterparties to trade Australian financial power only.  David Minns will 
have to get back to us about all the other products!

For the current U.S. list of counterparties, just mirror the approvals for 
"US Power Financial Swaps".

I will review the list Debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her 
approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals, but I think we should be fine.

Thanks for returning my message.  I had an Australian issue come up and 
anyone who was familiar with Australian law was unreachable and I was in an 
absolute panic.  But as things usually do, this problem worked itself out too!

As usual, I am always humbly in your debt...

I have developed a database in which I keep track of the counterparties Legal 
has approved, any supporting rationale for approval of each counterparty (I 
'm giving away my secret that I just don't approve them on on pure whim!) and 
the products such counterparties are approved to trade.  Additionally, at the 
bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the Password 
Application, ETA , GTC, or any other online documentation.

The information for the financial products is pretty accurate (I may have 
missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel 
spreadsheets.  If I have missed a counterparty let me know).  The information 
for Power has been updated only since this database was in production, about 
6-7 weeks ago.  I am going to have to go back and input the power data from 
the original approval lists.

As for gas trading and emerging products, we have never yet had a 
counterparty that we have had an issue with, so no information has been 
entered for those products. You should count them as being approved for 
everything.  Eventually, if we continue not to use those dropdowns, I will 
delete them.

I don't know if you will find this information helpful or not, take a look 
and I will be glad to hear any input.  Obviously, we are all working out the 
kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along, 
so this database may evolve over time.

The only people who should have change access are the Legal team (Mike 
Neves:  Mark Taylor, Carol St Clair, Leslie Hansen, Marie Heard and myself).  
Let me know if you have change access by mistake.

On a closing note, please try to keep the information in the database 
confidential to the group we have granted view access to. Do not forward this 
email on to anyone as it will grant access without my approval.  Much 
thanks!   

I would like to take responsibility for the technical side of this, but in 
all honesty I must admit I'm just the idea guy...(I'm know I'm breaking all 
your illusions about me today, I'll have no more secrets!)

1.  Per my discussion last week with David Minns, I sent him a spreadsheet so 
he could scroll across the product list and see the full range of products 
EnronOnline offers so he could determine whether an Australian based 
counterparty will have any legal problems entering into any of the 
EnronOnline products.  It was my understanding that he had not seen a 
comprehensive list off all the products we offer.

2.  However, on a going forward basis, David Minns or someone in Legal will 
need to see the daily spreadsheets reflecting any new Australian based 
counterparties because every new counterparty requesting a password needs a 
Credit and a Legal signoff for trading every products we offer, whether 
physical, financial, power, gas, liquids, weather, p&p, US, European or other 
country based product, etc..  Houston Legal does it every day for every new 
Houston Credit based counterparty, London Legal does it every day for every 
new London Credit based counterparty and Australian Legal will need to do the 
same.  If some other system will be in place in Australia, David Minns will 
need to discuss that with Mark Taylor and David Forster.

Please find attached referenced lists.  It is not clear to me yet how we are 
going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to 
look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.  Also, there were no 
counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.

I haven't said it in a while...but no European power for US counterparties...

Now might be your time to plant!

I'm already miserable with the Houston summer heat.  It's already in the high 
90's with high 90 humidity.  After 4-5 more months of this it's going to get 
pretty old!

How's little Sophie.  Any new cute things she's doing you need to tell me 
about?

Mark,

I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am 
not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you...
Paul Radous@ENRON
03/20/2000 03:12 PM
Tana,

As a follow up to Friday's discoveries, on the commodities side, it appears 
as though the agencies which regulate the commodity exchanges drive the rules 
regarding safeguarding of client accounts.  Other than 1) the US exchanges 
(which are all governed by the CFTC), and  2) the OMLX, and the IPE (which we 
have already addressed),  what are the other exchanges whose contracts we 
trade?  

Thanks
Paul

Lou,

I left Mark Tawney a voicemail to call me re: the ISDA sample form.  I'll 
need to know a little bit more about the company so I send them the right 
form.

The NYMEX has approved all of your applications and you should all have 
access to the system and be able to trade (everyone except Dana Davis, who 
still needs to complete his training).  Please let me know if you cannot log 
in.  I spoke to the NYMEX a minute ago and there is no reason from their 
perspective why you should not be able to log in.

I have tried to call him directly but he was not available.

Yes, I left him a voicemail telling him I needed to know a little more about 
the counterparty so I could make sure i send them the right form (are they US 
or non-US counterparty, insurance company, energy company, etc).  Also, the 
name and address of his contact and I will send it directly if he would 
prefer that.

FYI:

This should be forwarded to Mark Dana Davis.  There are two of us.

Thanks.

We have received an executed amendment to Electronic Trading Agreement with

distributed.

I will be out Friday afternoon and Monday afternoon for my termite and house 
inspections for my new house.

Due to people being out of the office today we were not able to finalise a 
response concerning  procedures to enable us to approve potential 
counterparties to trade Australian Power Derivatives. This would include 
arrangements to cover both counterparties  with a presence in Australia and 
those that do not. In the case of the later group I believe we can come up 
with a set of procedures to address credit, tax, regulatory and settlement 
requirements.    As I mentioned this morning Sydney is the first "satellite 
office" to introduce EnronOnline. I would hope we can develop procedures that 
are robust enough to be used as a template by other Enron offices. 

 I suspect tomorrow will also be a fairly demanding day with the press coming 
in for the launching of EnronOnline and a number of us heading down to 
Adelaide for Project Taipan. However settling this issue is major priority 
for us.

We also spoke about procedures to approve  Australian incorporated 
counterparties who seek access to other Enron products. I confirm that Tana 
will be forwarding details of them to me for legal clearance. I will arrange 
procedures to discharge this function when I am out of the office as a 24 
hour turn around is required.      

Per my voicemail, the attached confirm is still a moving target with the tax 
lawyers, I'll be in touch once we resolve the tax language.

I have been given the name of your company by a consultant we have hired to 
advise us on sofware systems to manage our physical and financial 
confirmation process and ISDA Master Agreements.  I have also seen 
information on your company in the January 1999 issue of Risk Magazine.  I am 
a Senior Legal Specialist in the Legal Dept. and am looking at software 
systems that can help us manage our documentation needs.

If you are unfamiliar with our company,  Enron is the largest integrated 
marketer of energy in the United States.  We have a Web Page located at 
I would like to obtain marketing material about the services you provide, and 
after I have a chance to look at the information, would like to talk to you 
or a representative from you company in some depth.  I am located in Houston, 
Texas and my phone number is (713) 853-3399.  Thank your for your attention 
herewith.

We discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday, and Mark gave me 
the go ahead to do a training, preferably a lunch training, sometime in 
April.  If you could get together with the members of our team and send me an 
email of any items in particular you would like addressed, we will try to 
address them in our training.  Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll 
check them against our schedule.  Would your group organize this lunch or 
ours?  How many people are we talking about.  Only Global Contract or Global 
Counterparty too?  Let me know the details so we can start planning...

Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict 
Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going 
forward basis.  To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based 
counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power.  
This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us 
evidence of their FERC licensing.

On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is 
Carthage Energy.  Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but 
we are not there yet.

On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my 
previous approvals.  Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am 
opening them up for all financial and power.

I spoke to Harry Collins, one of our emissions lawyers, and he said there 
should be no problem trading emissions with a governmental entity on the 
emissions auction website, as long as they can trade emissions generally.  If 
you have any specific questions, call Harry Collins at x39692.

We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

NOTE:   This master appears to have been signed in 1996 and didn't make its 
way down to Houston until now.

Type of Contract: Master Agreement (ECT Canada Form)

Effective Date:  06/16/95

Executed Date:  06/24/96

Counterparty:  Originally, NOVAGAS CLEARINGHOUSE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, now 
through name changes and merger, DYNEGY CANADA INC.

Transactions Covered: Energy price swaps or option transactions only (no pulp 
& paper, weather, interest rate & currency or FX)

GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  We need to get this master inputted immediately into the 
EnronOnline System so all of the confirmations for ENA and ECC will 
immediately roll up under this master.

CONFIRM DESK:  Please immediately start rolling up all the ENA and ECC trades 
under this master, whether online, offline, or brokered trades. 

Novagas has a long and tortured history...when you've got a few hours and 
want to be incredibly bored I'll share it with you.  Let's just say that 
Canada has been the only one aware of this signed master.  You can quote my 
somewhat eloquent words "if it ain't in Legal it ain't!"

You have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for 
several days, and at an agreed time I would like to include your approvals in 
with the rest of Legal's.  Right now I am still telling the EnronOnline 
people that they have to look to Australia for approvals.  Once we are in 
agreement about the parameters of my responses, and who your backup is, we 
can agree on a date when I will start responding for Australia too.  The 
theory will be that once I send you the email you will have 24 hours to 
respond or I will consider all the online products approved for Ausralian 
counterparties.  Because of the time change issue, I think we need to make 
the time my approval will go out 4:00 p.m. the next day (which will be your 
morning) from the transmittal of the list.

In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin 
funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of 
all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the 
products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any 
rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should 
include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy 
commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.

Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.  
Much thanks!

Per my conversation with Kathy Bolan at PG&E Energy Trading, Canada 
Corporation (and my confirmation thereof with Messrs. Suttle and Bowen), all 
cross-border trades between PG&E Canada and ENA should go under the master 
between PG&E Canada and ECC.

Thank you for your help.  I look forward to hearing from your U.S. person.

We have received the fully executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement 
dated as of December 1, 1999 between ECC and the referenced counterparty.  
This First Amendment adds the British Columbia Securities representation to 
the ISDA Master Agreement. 

Confirm Desk:  You no longer have to add this representation to every 
confirmation.

I have not started responding for Australia yet.

Entergy Power Marketing Corp. has applied for a Password and has asked us to 
give them a "comfort letter" stating that the current trading with them will 
go under the respective master for the product and not the online GTC.  I 
have spoken to Credit and we are trading financial gas, physical gas, and 
physical power (through EPMI).  Can you please let me know first, if you have 
a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern 
the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master 
agreement will govern the trades, please provide me the exact name, parties 
and date of the contract.  Obviously, as usual with online matters, this is a 
RUSH.

As usual, you are the best!

Can you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.  We just got a 
master in signed with them and they cannot trade weather, pulp & paper & fx.  
Much thanks!

Per my conversation with Kathy Moore this morning, please open the referenced 
counterparty to trade all financial products.

Attached is the proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement with Platt's.

Some notes on the attached lists:

3/24/00 List - the first two counterparties have no Legal changes per my 
earlier approvals.

3/27/00 List-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do 
pulp & paper and weather under it.
Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a 
temporary "no" for them for financial products until I get more information 
on them to determine what they are and what they can do.  Per Credit, AMBAC 
only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently 
not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.  If we get a 
parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status.  
In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine 
what if anything they can do.

3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening 
them up.   I sent an email about that earlier this week.

On this Statoil Trade, I guess this is a physical trade done with ENA.  Can 
you do one of those handy dandy little sheets you do for me so I can attach 
them to my assignment.

I am forever in your debt...

	
	                           
	

Good Afternoon Tana,

StatOil Energy has performed a deal that they would now like reassigned under 
a new counterparty name - StatOil Energy Services Inc.  I explained to Kara 
Mucha (StatOil contact) that the trades done on EOL were firm and in order to 
actually have this done, an assignment needed to be drafted by legal etc.    

I am forwarding the details on a deal performed on 3/28/00 that needs to be 
reassigned.   Bob Bowen in confirmations explained that we should perform an 
over the counter trade just exactly the opposite  to cancel out the trade and 
then perform the trade over the counter with the right counterparty name.  
However in verifying with our Product Control Group, they suggested I forward 
this information on to you.

I hope that you will be able to assist or at least direct me in the right 
direction.  Should you need more clarification or have any questions (since I 
have kinda rambled on) please do not hesitate to call me at ext.36283.

Thank You,

Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference 
and noticed you were signed up to "relax at the resort".  Not to get you 
worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San 
Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!  After 
all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were 
here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.  (Not to 
belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the 
fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length "pedal pushers".)

We look forward to seeing our favorite Englishman (delete this message after 
viewing, we don't want the other lads to get jealous!)

Credit will amend the EOL profile for KN Marketing LP today to open them for 
financial trading.  Please change their EOL password to trade under the ISDA 
master with KN Marketing LP and remove authority to trade under KN Trading 
Inc.  All financial and physical trades should be booked with KN Marketing 
LP, so please move remaining deals from KN Trading Inc. accordingly.  Our 
Credit contacts state there should be no more deals with KN Trading Inc.

What ever happened to that CGAS certificate we were trying to get in 
connection with my swap agreement?  Last note I had was that resolution we 
were trying to get requires approval of Board for each trade and you were 
going to talk to Mark about how to resolve this.  Was it resolved?

David has sent us a memo re: Procedures for Approval to trade in Australia 
that I think you will find helpful.

Attached are the GTCs that I have revised to address tax issues that would 
arise from counterparties with no Australia presence. I am content settlement 
provisions already covered in the documentation. I have also developed a 
checklist for new counterparties. Would you pass onto Chris Catt at PW for 
his signoff. 

 

I continue to say "no" for financial because they are not an eligible swap 
participant.  For a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if 
they are not one in their own right, they would have to post an up front 
letter of credit fully covering their trading PRIOR to doing any trades.  So 
this ball is in Credit's court.

Per your request...

Sounds good to me!  Saturday, 8:00 am at Buffalo Grille it is!

Attached is the referenced Confidentiality Agreement.  I hope to have the 
Fieldston one to you shortly.

Attached please find the referenced agreement.

Per the request of Sara, attached is the form of US online GTC (w/collateral).

We have received notice that the referenced counterparty is updating its 
phone system and is changing all of its phone numbers.  I am sending a copy 
of the notice to the usual distribution.

The list of new phone numbers will be sent to my usual distribution for 
documentation, which includes Connie Sutton from Global Contracts.  As to 
what numbers they are replacing, they are replacing all the phone numbers we 
might have had across the board with this counterparty.  If you would like to 
see the numbers, obtain a copy of the notice from Connie Sutton.  As I just 
mailed it, it should get there in a few days.

Per my voicemail, attached is my list of agreements.

Your big opportunity appears to be here!  Some guy in the for sale database 
under misc messages is looking to put together a team for the year 2000.  
This is your big break...

Per my conversations with Tom and Frank, unless Credit specifically tells us 
that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty, the online team 
should consider that all U.S. based counterparties are not approved to trade 
credit derivatives.  Credit will, in the same box where they put "declined" , 
"amended" or "division", put a note that says "credit derivatives" and in 
those circumstances only you should consider that I will be indicating 
whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives.  
Otherwise, I will not be putting an "X" in the box for each and every 
counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives.

I hope this makes sense to you, call me if it doesn't.

There is no change from my previous approvals for the only counterparty on 
the 3/30/00 list, so I am not sending that list.

On the list for 3/31/00, first, David Minns is in the Houston office today, 
so I gave the response today for the one Australian counterparty on this 
list.  We are meeting with Mark on Wednesday to try and figure out the 
approval process for Australia, so maybe after Wednesday I'll start 
responding for them.

Second, on this list please note that there are no counterparties that have 
been indicated as credit derivative counterparties, so none of the 
counterparties on this list should be approved to trade credit derivatives 
(even though I haven't "X'ed" them out).

We have received the executed Letter Agreement with the referenced 
counterparty dated April 3, 2000 amending the EnronOnline Electronic Trading 
Agreement.  Copies will be distributed.

Attached are the Confidentiality Agreements for the referenced counterparties.

Attached please find the referenced list.  Remember, no credit derivatives 
are approved for any counterparites unless Credit has indicated they are a 
credit derivative counterparty on the list.

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated April 4, 2000 with the 
referenced counterparty amending the Electronic Trading Agreement .  Copies 
will be distributed.

We have received the executed copy of the amendment dated April 5, 2000 to 
the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies 
will be distributed. 

We have received fully executed copies of the following Confidentiality 
Agreements:

Energy Argus, Inc. dated April 5, 2000

AccuWeather, Inc. dated April 4, 2000

Copies have been faxed to the counterparties.  I will also send copies to 
Dave Samuels for your files.

Attached is the referenced list.  Again, my note about credit derivatives not 
being marked, and also, I am still not responding for Australia yet on a 
going forward basis.

Are we trading with the referenced counterparty?

Russell,

In the future please put me on all notices about counterparty trading.  I am 
responsible for the Legal Department's approval of online counterparties 
across all product areas and need to know any limitations that might affect a 
counterparties' ability to trade.

Thanks!

NO TRADES should be approved going forward.

The counterpary has been placed on Credit Watch for No Trades.

The appropriate traders have been notified although most of their 
transactions are executed through EOL.  Thier profile on EOL will be amended 
to NO TRADES until more information is made available.

Troy Black called me about that C.A. I passed on to you.  He said he needed 
it to go out today and also passed on words from the counterparty to the 
effect that the C.A. was "non-negotiable and that if we had any comments they 
need to be minor, or forget about it..."

There you have it!

We have executed a Letter Agreement dated April 10, 2000 amending the 
Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will

Per letter dated 12/23/99, Merchant Energy Group of the America's requested 
the termination of the CES GISBs and ISDA as it was their preference to use 
the existing ENA Ks (Master Purchase/Sale #96017205 & ISDA #96019306). I have 
set the termination dates for the CES/CEM GISBs (CES GISB #96028991 & CEM 
GISB #96028994) to 4/30/00 so that they will be reported in the monthly 
termination/expiration report. Please note that the CEM GISB is in your 
(Stacy/Debra) stack of non-executed contracts that we (Galye & I) sent up 
last month. It can now be routed to the file room (at least that is one 
'solved' out of the stack). I've forwarded a copy of the letter to Anthony so 
he can take care of the CES ISDA (K#96029703).

She seemed very nice, like she would make a good employee.  I spoke to Liz 
Sager who, although she didn't directly work with her, got report from her 
old law firm of people that did, and Liz said to was extremely well liked, 
and very energetic.  

I have a letter on its way to Mike Moscoso right now (interoffice mail).  We 
requested 5000 for nat gas any one month, but were only approved for an 
additional 2000.  So we went from 15,000 to 17,000.

Welcome back!

Attached is an updated list of the Confidentiality Agreements. 

Attached please find the referenced lists.  I am not sending the list for 
4/5/00 because all of the counterparties on that list were Credit declines.  
I have responded for Australia Legal on the 4/7/00 list.  Remember, no credit 
derivatives approved unless specifically indicated (which none are).

We do have it signed.  However, the Company's name was not correct in the 
agreement so I spoke to Wayne Greenberg and it said it was okay to go ahead 
and change the name on the C.A. he signed, and I just wanted to get a copy 
back from him initialled by the name change so we have a record of his 
agreement.

Bob, can you send me a copy of the EnronOnline confirm so I can prepare 
this.  Thanks!

	
	                           
	

Tana,
Sheri has asked me to send you the following information in order to prepare 
a termination agreement for the following EOL deal.  On Monday, April 10th, 
the day the transaction occurred, Enron had network issues that caused some 
external connection issues. During this time, the customer accidently hit the 
same product twice . I verified that there was 2 exact transactions by the 
noted counterparty.

 We were not aware that our trader let them out of the second transaction 
until late afternoon or else we would of mandated an OTC transaction to net 
out the second EOL transaction. Please call me with any questions.
Thanks!

Per Lotus Notes it appears that the above counterparty was acquired by Duke.  
I have sitting in my files the originals of both theirs and our guarantees.  
Do we want to keep these in place, mutually cancel them or what?  We sent 
execution documents to the counterparty and never heard back and put it on 
the inactive status.

I have not received any feedback from Edmund or David regarding the email 
below.  Can you please respond as I am getting daily prompts for a response.  
MUCH THANKS!

For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.  What rules, 
besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off 
exchange trades you might enter into.  For instance, here in the U.S. energy 
commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options 
might be governed by the SEC.  Besides the exchanges your email reflected, 
what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might 
enter into?

In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin 
funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of 
all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the 
products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any 
rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should 
include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy 
commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.

Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.  
Much thanks!

I have not been getting a response from my outside the U.S. attorneys, so I 
just emailed them a reminder again, and tried to make them feel really 
guilty.  I hope that works!

Actually, we girls have that built in guilt gene, it just improves with 
age...but do I need to speak to your mother?  Is there anything you would 
like to confess...?

What can I say...?!

fax: ( 713) 646-3490

David,

What Australian laws besides the rules of the exchange would govern the 
trades?

Can you please prepare a print out for us of all the financial masters your 
records reflect and what type of agreement we have executed .  Thanks!

FYI,

To date, we have executed 21 amendments to ETA's.

We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement from the 
referenced counterparty and I have faxed it to counterparty today.  A copy 
will be sent to Dave.

Thanks for your response!

On online, when there are Australian counterparties I will just wait to hear 
from you and include your responses with mine (even tho you will  probably 
tell me they can only trade Australian power!).  Do you have a back up yet?

Oops, what a surprise!  When I went to file away my file on the CFTC Form 40, 
I noticed I already had a file in the regulatory cabinet where where had 
filed the form in 1995 and 1997.  Maybe we have to file these every other 
year?

We have received the executed Termination Agreement dated as of April 10, 
2000 terminating the referenced trade.  Per the request of Jennifer de 
Boisblanc Denny, this termination was prepared because the customer hit the 
same product twice on EOL and two exact transactions were entered into the 
system.  I will send the original (fax) down to Bob Bowen for handling.

Attached is the referenced agreement.  Please do not hesitate to call me if I 
can be of any further assistance.  I am a paralegal in the Legal Dept.  My 
direct phone no is (713) 853-3399.

Mike,

Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.  That 
would include the "Yes, Yes with Limits, and No" buttons and also a comment 
screen for the new products.

The two new products are:  Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth

Thanks!

By the way, I can't figure out how to move the Portland masters off the 
master swap list.  I think I am going to need your help with that.

will someone be sending us the report?

I look forward to seeing you!  As soon as I get the recipes, I'll forward 
them on!

Who is Legal requested the master?

Carol St. Clair had her assistant reserve EB46C1 on May 24 from 11:30 -2:00 
for our luncheon.  Can you please confirm that that date is good for your 
group and also the total head count.  Suzanne will take care of ordering 
lunch for us.

Thanks!

Effective March 1, 2000, Aquila Energy acquired the assets of USGT (U.S. Gas 
Transportation Inc.) , with the acquiring entity being USGT/Aquila L.P.  USGT 
has assigned the Electronic Trading Agreement it executed with ENA to 
USGT/Aquila L.P.  A copy of the assignment will be forwarded to Frank Davis.

That envelope should probably go to Rob Milnthorp.  I'll have a copy walked 
down to John Lavorato here.  It is a list of all of our NYMEX positions, and 
the list should be provided by Rob to any traders trading NYMEX out of 
Canada.

What's your pleasure on the below guarantees?
Tanya Rohauer

Probably cancel them as Duke is clsoing these operations and assigning all 
trades to Duke. Talk to Tracy as NP has always been more of a Power 
counterparty, and she is the Duke expert.

Thanks,
Tanya

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
counterparty dated April 12, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.

Attached please find the referenced list.  For Tosco Refining Company, it 
should be set up as Tosco Refining Company, a division of Tosco Corporation.  
We need to get the incorporated entity on the hook.

There is an Australian counterparty on today's list.

No conflict with me.  I sent the date of the 24th to Anthony and asked him to 
confirm it with his people and get back to me.

Per our conversation, attached is the form of Amendment to the ETA, revised 
to reflect your correct name.  Also, while I was revising the document, I 
added today's date, and the page number and footer reflecting the document 
name.

Call me again at (713) 853-399 if you have any more questions, otherwise, I 
will await your fax of the signed amendment and bring it to one of our 
officers for signature.

Can you please add David Minns, a lawyer from our Australia office as an 
auhorized person with full privileges to the Master Swap Agreement Database 
(of course, only I should have keyword change and deletion ability).

tana jones will attend

Is your counterparty on today's list approved?

Edmund,

You are the only person I have now not heard from.  When can I expect to get 
your response?

Justy, thanks for your quick response.  I heard back from Edmund too, and he gave me the name of a V&E lawyer he has used in London for Russian law and Anne Koehler and I gave him a quick call.  Doug Glass.   So we switched it to NY law and ICC arbitration rules and are giving it a go.  Thanks for your help!  I can't believe our business guy call 2 hours before a lunch meeting with a Russian company and think it's business as usual!

tana

i would keep in the arbitration clause (this is better than submission to the courts).  i assume that the counterparty is a corporate or toher commercial enterprise, and that it will accept texas law?  if this is the case, what you have in the letter agreement should suffice.

j

I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.

Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks!

 << File: confidentiality agmt-online (bilateral 11-29-00).doc >> 

I just spoke to Stephanie Sever with the EOL team, and she said this counterparty has been approved and should migrate tonight and they will send them a password out tomorrow.

Do we have anything on this entity that is in the pipeline?  I do not have anything on this.  

If you do not, I wonder if it is another one that Dan Hyval was handling prior to his departure?

Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar:

1.  "executed"
2.  "executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master
3.  "executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it
4.  "executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master
5.  "executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement

Thanks for your attention herewith.

Any conflicts?
We are considering them to re-design our web site. Both The Adcetera Group and Organic Inc. are submitting proposals to work on the project and we need them to be under the same NDA.

RE:
Change in Trading Hours for Natural Gas Futures and Options for Thursday,
October 4,
2001

The executive committee of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today
decided to change the trading hours for its natural gas futures and options
contracts for tomorrow, October 4, so that they close at 2:30 PM instead of
2:00 PM, as previously announced.

Brandon,

I need the full legal name & address of this company.  Thanks...

Tana-

Could you please forward a draft NDA to Rick Gomes at HSBC.  They are looking at a potential Object Code license or the potential to post their F/X products on EOL.  

				Thanks,  WAX

Hi Brandon

I received your message and have been attending an off-site this week
so apologies for the day delay in responding.

We have reviewed a couple of different possibilities which I will describe and
then
based on your needs, we can follow up with the more specific questions.

The simplest and fastest path to take would have us streaming FX quotes to
your site, preferably via RV messsaging. These would be indicative quotes and
could be streamed 24 hours/day. For trading,we could place on the site a button
that would launch
a new HTML window that would in effect be our app that could credit check,
quote,
and autotrade the transaction.

The second path involves integration into your platform. The main issue I see is
the construction
of the price-we would typically tier based on the transaction size and currency.
Our platform
ordinarily requires the user to state the currency pair and amount before we
transmit the quote.
We also have 'brakes' on the system; sanity checks, staleness checks etc that
temporarily
disable autotrading and alert the traders. If the second path is preferred, I
believe we would need
to see if your market manager could handle our requirements or if we need to use
a different
approach. I believe the credit checking portion would not be a difficult hurdle.

The third path is a white labelling type approach where we simply provide Enron
with liquidity,
and Enron uses our price as a wholesale source, adds whatever spreads it would
like, and be
in the middle of the transaction. I understand this would be a business decision
away from
you, but if it is a possibility that would change the technical requirements.

I will give you a call tomorrow afternoon to follow up .

Thanks

Rick Gomes

There is a meeting of the Name/Change Merger Group Meeting on Monday at 1:00 pm in 49c4 to talk about timing of suspensions.  I don't know what, if any, relevance this will have for us, but since you do the name changes/mergers, I thought you might need to attend.  I wanted to forward you the email, but once I clicked yes, I will attend, it went away.

NDA for COMYSY Information Technology Services, Inc.

Hi Tana,

I was told to pass this NDA info (below) to you.  Would you please email this to Vince Cook at his email address noted below with a cc to me?  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Nick,
Assume you will send a soft copy so I can forward to legal for review.
Thanks,

Division

Hi Vince,

It was good to talk to you today.  I need the following for the NDA:
Exact legal name
Corp Address
Contact (if other than you) and title 

Hopefully we can strike a mutually fruitful relationship.

Talk to you soon,
Nick

P.S.
Also, just a couple of suggestions for your web site team.
1.  Get rid of the "boing" mouseovers on the main page.That's awful!
2.  Under "Contact" it should be more than a form to email in.  Add
contact information.

Just my thoughts.  I liked your previous site (from a user-friendliness
perspective) better.

Attached is a list of the Termination Letters I have been able to locate so far.  Tanya suggested that Bear Stearns termination is just a close-out of a NYMEX margin position and I have a call into Greg Whiting to see if that is the case.

I spoke to Craig Breslau about the Pemex termination and he knows nothing about that.  He said if it happened it would have gone thru his desk.  What are your thoughts on that?

There appear to be two International Paper Deals.  Craig Breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $12,163,283.  There was another International Paper deal the Confirmation Desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $1,311,164.  Craig, any knowledge of this other one?

No copy either of the executed terminations of the Proctor & Gamble deals the Confirmation Desk prepared for (i) deal no. Y 49018.1 for $81,083, and (ii) deal no. 49011.1 for $442,000.

That just leaves the Socal-JP Morgan on Debbie's list with no copy.

 

This counterparty was on the 8/15/01 list and wanted to trade east power.  You wre checking on their ability to trade power.  Any update?

The Counterparty system indicates that this counterparty was suspended on 3/15/01.  Cheryl Johnson's (Counterparty Group) comments state:  
 
"Spoke to Bill Bergner who states that he has sent documentation to legal regarding the conversion.  He said they did business under a group of different entities other than "Inc."  In Jan. '99, they combined those entities to form the LLC, so it wasn't a simple conversion per se.  He also stated that this entity should be deleted (inactivated), as there will be no business conducted in that name.  This record will be suspended pending inactivation."
 
Does anyone in legal know anything about this because we do have an active contract in the contract system?
 
This is part of the contract audit I've been working on.

I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.  He mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to get that approved by Credit.
Please find attached our form of notice and amendment to the ISDA agreement

Here is the guaranty from Trans Alta.

Thanks for the email.  I just got out of an all morning meeting.  I had already drafted the agreement for APB Europe.  I'll redraft it as directed.

The agreement should have two counterparties

Norwegian Energy Brokers AS and First Energy Brokers AS

The products will be:

Norwegian Energy Brokers AS will have Nordic Power and Nordic Weather 
First Energy Brokers AS will have all the other product types (UK Power; UK Gas; European Gas, European Power, European Coal, European Bandwidth)

It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them.
This Cp was primarily interest in price discovery and was going to consider whether to pursue EOL access.  I informed them that if they want EOL access, I need documentation re municipal authority.  They never followed up with me.

We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:

Team A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone
              Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 
              
	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies

Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2
               Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof 

             Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies

Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.
              Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.

                         Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.

           I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.

We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment. 
 

OK for me.

Jay,

I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents Stephanie forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get Fred involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from Enron Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or Ken Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this.
Stephanie -

Please advise the counterparty that we will be terminating the below agreements:

	Master Energy Price Swap Agreement b/t ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES and BELCO OIL & GAS CORP.
	Master Energy Price Swap Agreement b/t ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES and BELCO ENERGY CORP.

There are two reasons why we wish to terminate these agreements.  First, they do not contain threshold/margining provisions, except in the case of a default or material adverse change.  Second, the documents are the old master agreements and not ISDAs. 

If the counterparty still desires to trade under the name Belco Oil & Gas Corp., I am happy to provide them with an ISDA draft, but I want to review the latest financials of Westport Resources Corporation (the surviving entity) to assess credit quality and provisions required for the new master.  They will need to provide us with the new financial information.  In the meantime, I am content to allow trading under the ISDA with Westport Oil & Gas Company.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

JRW

Tanya/Jay,
I am forwarding to you documentation from Westport Resources Corporation regarding the merger with Belco Oil & Gas.  As you know, we have existing financial agreements with both companies, as identified below:

Belco Oil & Gas - Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated July 8, 1999, which has unlimited credit
Westport Oil & Gas Company, Inc. - ISDA Master Agreement dated March 17, 1998

The Counterparty wants to retain the Belco Master.  Please let me know what Credit wants to do.

Stephanie 

We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????
Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!!

All of this relates to a broker Bob Shults wants to open up to trade on EOL.  When you have a minute can you give me or Mark a call so we can sort out who we want to trade with.  Thanks.
Tana -

I spoke to Joe Wright at APB this morning.  Here is the rub on this matter:

 - APB has a $500K LC outstanding to cover the US trading
 - Norwegin Energy Brokers - AS is a brokerage house trading in Nordic/EU areas (mostly in Scandinavian countries)
 - First Energy Brokers - AS was formed by NEB for purposes of trading in the Netherlands (not sure of the timing)
 - NEB owns a large stake in FEB, but not all of the entity.
 - APB is currently a 23% owner of NEB (thus indirectly owning a piece of FEB)
 - APB is looking to purchase the balance of the ownership of NEB which is CONFIDENTIAL (seeking to close sometime later this month)
 - Joe indicated his thought that, post-NEB purchase, there is a good chance that NEB and FEB will be merged
 - Joe also indicated that it would not be a problem for the APB LC to be expanded to these entities - if this is what credit would need.

I do not know if we have any history with either NEB or FEB, but I am sure we need to talk to credit to figure out what is needed in order for the trading to take place.  Can you follow this up or do you want me to do so?

Thanks.

Mark

Tana, 

The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

We will prepare 32 Thursday.

We have received an executed side letter agreement dated 08/10/01 with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. ("El Paso) which states that "notwithstanding the provisions of the Electronic Trading Agreement or the product descriptions on the EOL website, all financial derivative transactions entered into by El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. on the Web Site which are listed by either ENA or ECC will be deemed to be entered into between El Paso and ENA and will be governed the the ISDA Master Agreement between El Paso and ENA dated 12/1/99".

Copies will be distributed.

At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our form of Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897or Bob Shults at (713) 853-0397.  We look forward to hearing from you.

 

 

We will also be getting these Mid-Market EIM Group Customer Lists on a going forward basis.  I spoke to Credit and for right now we will only be approving these counterparties to trade physical steel.  As with the regular online trading lists, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN ONE DAY, I will take it that you do not have any legal issues with the counterparties below trading.

Know anything about these deals?
Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Any conflicts?

At the request of Ross Mesquita, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.

 

OK for you?

Tana, Chris amended the payment terms to mirror the APB quarterly payments.  Please check to make sure it is ok. then send for signature.

Bob:

Here are the changes necessary to complete the agreements in a manner that
mirrors APB's documents.  Please let me know if you have any questions or
concerns with these changes.

Thanks,
Chris

my redline comments.  all my changes make the NEB agreements consistent with
the APB agreements.

Joe:

The one item that does not mesh with our agreement is the payment terms
outlined in the Fee Agreement document.  If you remember, we pay this fee on
a quarterly basis.  I have already called Bob and informed him we would be
changing this section to mirror the agreement for APB.  The only difference
is the price!

Thanks,
Chris

Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota Corporation has been added.

 

This counterparty has transact ability on European and Asian Metals.  They have hardly transacted at all, only power, much less any metals.  We figure they are using the website for price discovery.  If I do not hear back from you within 24 hours whether London Legal has done any due diligence on this counterparty's authority to transact metals, it is my intention to shut them down for all metals products.

Per Stephanie's request, attached is an updated list.

 

I have reviewed the binder of confirms and have prepared a list of the missing or unexecuted confirms.  Kim. if you could please review this short list and provide me copies of the missing confirms and/or if we have received copies of any of the unexecuted confirms since you provided these confirms to me I would be most appreciative.

If at all possible, could you please approve Sabic Americas this morning. I am trying to get this customer an ID by this evening as I will be meeting with him at a conference tommorow.

Thought I would check back with you to see if you have had time to address the issue (below) I had forwarded you on the 8th of this month.  I am trying to tie up loose ends on as many open name change issues as I can before I go on vacation.  Currently I am in need of copies of the Secretary of State certificates for the merger and the concurrent name change.  Belco Oil & Gas Corp has quite a bit of exposure and is on Credit Watch; with this in mind I would like to clean this merger up in the database as soon as possible. As I mentioned below, Mr Boigon will only speak to someone from our Legal Department since he feels he has sent ample documentation already.  

Please feel free to forward me a name and number if you would prefer I re-direct this inquiry.

Sincerely,

Ruby Kyser
Ext 5-8136
Good afternoon, I work with Cheryl Johnson in Global Counterparty doing name changes, acquisitions, and mergers and have run into a minor setback with one of the counterparties:

I received a lead from one of my co-workers that a merger and concurrent name change had occurred involving the above referenced entities.  To follow up on the lead I spoke to Howard Boigon at 303-575-0143, and I requested documentation in the form of copies of Secretary of State documents relevant to the changes.  Mr. Boigon informed me that he had forwarded a DPL Notice to you with a "complete package" detailing the transaction.  He refuses to send anything further until I get with you and find out if what he sent is sufficient; if it is not he has requested that someone from legal call him and explain what we need and why.

Could you please follow up with me on this issue...don't you just love Mondays?!

If we have not located any dealmaker interested in this counterparty can we close out this counterparty and get it out of the work cue?
It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them.
This Cp was primarily interest in price discovery and was going to consider whether to pursue EOL access.  I informed them that if they want EOL access, I need documentation re municipal authority.  They never followed up with me.

This counterparty was on the 8/15/01 list and wanted to trade east power.  You wre checking on their ability to trade power.  Any update? 
Hi Tana,

Thank you,

Per our discussion, attached is the referenced NDA for transmittal to counterparty.

 

We also have lots of agreements between internal counterparties. 

I also owe you more comments...I haven't forgotten...

All,

We are currently working on the data model for the Trading Agreements System and have a question pertaining to internal/external counterparties.  Are all agreements between an internal company(counterparty) and an external company(counterparty)?  I spoke with Meredith Stewart (the data architect for this project) and she found an agreement between 2 internal counterparties, e.g. Enron Louisiana and ECT.

Please let me know ASAP.

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.
	No idea. EGM doesn't exist.

Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?
Tana,

I was just following about these trades.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

There has been a little confusion about how this Counterparty wishes to be set up on EnronOnline, and after talking to the Counterparty, Darren Vanek in Credit, and Mary Cook we have come to the following agreement:

The counterparty will be (and I think already may be?) set up in the GCP System as Vector Pipeline, LP

I told the Counterparty that special Confirmation Templates would be prepared for this Counterparty and the signature line should be prepared as follows:

Vector Pipeline, LP, by its Managing General Partner,
  Vector Pipeline, LLC

By:  _____________________
Name:  __________________
Title:  ____________________

This form of signature block should be used for all EnronOnline and any offline trades for counterparty as well.

The Password Application has been executed by the Counterparty correctly so there is no need to have him re-apply.

Travis,
 
I looked in Mark Greenberg's office, and I did not find the agreements you were looking for, but I did find Mark's True Quote file there and in it are two executed amendments to the Price Posting Agreement.  We only have a draft of the original Price Posting Agreement in his file, no signed copy.

I am trying to locate the Enron Net Works/True Quote file (Equity Investment documents and Posting Agreement).  Please let me know if you have seen it or have a copy set of the documents.

Patrick,

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

Here is a list of all the trades with EGM.

This cpy was on the 10/5/01 list with a note "replacing profile for BP Exploration & Oil Inc."  We've got a few issues here.  First, we just can replace profiles.  If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.  Is this?  If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.  I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  I just can't move the profile.

What's the scoop here?  I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you?

Please see attached.

Yes it will also be there today.

In order to expedite getting Non-Disclosure Agreements (Confidentiality Agreements) in place, it would expedite matters if the Enron Credit Inc. followed the following procedures:

1.  Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, Tana Jones
2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address
3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer
4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only Enron is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to Enron.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation.
5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up.
6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.

Upon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the Enron Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance.

Re: Experian we need:

1.  Full Legal Name and Address
2.  Mark wants a more exact description of the nature of your discussions
3.  An email address so we can send it directly to counterparty

Kim -

Please provide me with the full name and address for Experian.  Also, we can forward the agreement on your behalf if you provide us with an e-mail address and contact name.  Finally, please give me some indication of the exact nature of the discussions, if there is any need to make the NDA specific vs. general.

If you provide these items today, we should be able to get our language out later this afternoon, tomorrow moring at the latest.

Mark:

I have started discussions with Experian, likely to result in Experian becoming Enron's #2 provider of credit scoring data.  I need to get an NDA in place with Experian ASAP to cover sensitive items likely to be covered during our negotiations.  I would like to get our NDA language to them today.  Please advise as to how to proceed...

	450 Gears Road,  Suite 130

Nature of Discussions:

Several groups within Enron (RAC, Enron Direct North America, Enron Direct Canada,  Enron Direct U.K., Enron Credit) use credit scoring information to approve/deny credit to potential counterparties associated with deal flow.  D&B, the top source of this information in North America, only covers about 60% of the counterparties in which we have interest.  We want to bring Experian data into the credit process to get North American coverage up >90%.  It is possible that will want to use Experian to support Canada, UK, Spain and Netherlands markets as well.  As we get into discussion with Experian, we will need to reveal details about RAC, EES, EC, our systems, marketing plans, target acceptance rates, etc.  They will need to reveal limitations relating to coverage, interfaces, data structure, etc.  It is the coverage of these discussions I am seeking.

This counterparty was approved by Legal on Friday.
Hey guys-
BASF is still not showing up as legal reviewing even thought Wendi approved on 10/16. Please make sure that this gets on to Tana, so that we can get this ID out ASAP.

Thanks!
Jen

Jennifer:

BASF slipped by.  I really thought I had taken care of that one, but I will have it completed this morning.  FYI: sometimes Credit has completed its part and Legal needs to review.  Until PCG flips the status to "Legal Reviewing" the status will still reflect "Credit Reviewing".  This usually happens intraday, as PCG is diligent about updating the status field.

Wendi,
Just wondering if things are moving ok from credit to legal in the pa database, as I seem to keep running into cps that your comment says credit approved, but the status is still at credit reviewing....
The latest is BASF Corporation. Can you make sure this moves on to legal? Gracias!

The actual name of the counterparty on this one is Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation.

Please see the below.  The VMAC agreement we did for CommodityLogic, if you do not already have it in your files, is in my O drive in CommodityLogic under Confidentiality Agreements.  I password protected it.  The password is "cllegal".

Please provide me with a brief description of the project or work that is going to be discussed with VMAC and a contact name/e-mail address.  We will do the necessary conflict check and send the agreement to VMAC directly.

Marc,

Thanks for your prompt response. I currently need the same NDA modified for Enron Net Works. Thanks for your help.

Mark -

Pursuant to your voice mail message, attached is a copy of the NDA I prepared for VMAC with CL.  If you need a document of this nature for EOL, please let me know and our office can prepare it and forward it for your use.  The Legal Dept. prepares and forwards NDA's so that we can track them and ensure terms are legally acceptable.

She needs to get a copy from London, I would suggest contacting Matt Dawson.  We do not have copies of London's masters.

Tana,

Are you familiar with the above?  If so, is it possible to provide soft copies to Jane McBride?

Thanks.
Nony
		

Nina - could you plse look into whether we have a soft copy of this ISDA in London - thanks - Paul

I need to get a copy of the above because customer wants to do the same form of ISDA docs with Enron Japan for weather trades.  Not sure whether it would have been done out of London or Houston although I suspect the former.  

If it was London, Paul, I wonder if you coudl let me know who to contact for full soft copies of the docs.

Nony, if it was Houston, do you know how I get full soft copies of all the docs (including guarantee).

Thanks to both of you.

Thanks.

Jane

Dear Jane McBride

I got a call from Mitsui Marine that they want to forego ISDA contract.
They and Enron credit have already had an ISDA agreement.
According to this, the contact was done under the head office guarantee basis.
(I don't know the detail)
If the contract between Enron Japan and them will be made under the same term and condition
It will be great help for both sides.
Their interest for us is only trade of weather derivatives (they don't have a needs of any other commodities). 
Could you show it them under the same term and condition?
Again if it will be all right that this thing will go smooth and quick.

They are settled, but not executed.  We have sent the ETA amendment out to the DB lawyer for signature, but we have not gotten it back signed.  I'll give here a call.

Hey Tana.  

I got a call this morning from someone in the DB offices in London who seems to think that the issues between us, relating to
EOL I guess, are all settled - and she'd like to know where we'll be signing their assignment agreement.  Can you give her
a call:

011 44 207 547 0883

I think her name is Sara - but I listened to her messege 4 times, and can't really make out what she said her name was. 

Thanks,
Diane
  

We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????
Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!! 

:)

Do any of you have any problems with keeping these trades as they are now that we've figured out what they are.  If not we'll just keep them as they were...
Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.  

Thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

Bill

Here is a list of all the trades with EGM.

I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.
	No idea. EGM doesn't exist.

Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?
Tana,

I was just following about these trades.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

It was a pleasure having you as a houseguest!  Anytime...

The current issue of Texas Monthly is only the beginning...right after we announced our current earnings last week, The Wall Street Journal originated a story about a partnership our CFO invested in that made questionable statements about conflicts of interests with the shareholders, non-disclosure of profits, etc., and have kept up with this story since last week, we have had shareholder lawsuits, SEC inquiries, our stock has taken a dive down to $15 today, down from $33 when the story first ran, and $87 since the beginning of the year.  Right now it is beat up Enron time with no end in sight.  Anyway, you may to check the WSJ website and catch up...

Also,  I have a new boyfriend, my old biking buddy I mentioned we've been dating now for a few months, that seems to be going well.  So that's all my news...

XXOO

Tana,

I was thinking of you today because I just got my issue of Texas Monthly and
both of your Houston employers were subjects of stories.  You might be
interested.

How have you been?  I really appreciate your putting me up for the weekend.
I would very gladly return the favor if I can.  Which reminds me.  Do you
want to come here this summer to see the Vatican exhibit?  The tickets are
free, you just need to reserve them.  There is an 800 number for info.  When
I find it again I can send it to you.  There is also a website,under the
auspices of Texas Tech museum.

That's all for now.  Take care.

Kathy

Cover title: Enron's Cutthroat Culture=20
How Enron Blew It=20
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz=
.php>>=20
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20

You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.

"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

Here's set of any master agreements I need ASAP.  

I didn't mention it on the earlier ones, but for all of these, if any of the agreements have been amended, I will need any amendments, as well as any guarantees.  Much thanks!

No, only executed amendments.

If the amendments are not executed, do you still want them?

Yes, everything.

Tana, the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier is the 3rd last agreement on their list [so I'm not sure what #1 on their list is].  I'm not sure what the 2nd and 3rd agreements on their list are either.

We do, however, have an Interruptible Agreement dated May 26/94 [not on their list] and a Firm (<31 Day) Gas P/S Agreement dated August 1/94 [which is, I think, #5 on their list] with Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (now BP Canada Energy Company).  Do you want copies of these agreements?

I don't know what the other agreements are.

Barbara Gray has asked me to seek your advice concerning our Enron Net Work client's request that we send a Confidentiality Agreement to an Enron Net Works customer located in Australia.  Among the issues we are concerned with are whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Australian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable or would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.  When you have a minute we would be most appreciative of your input.  I have attached the form of Confidentiality Agreement we propose to submit to our customer.

I saw you across the dining room at Luther's but you left before I got a chance to wish you a Happy New Year's.  I'm sorry you're bring me such cold weather for this week.  I'll have to take your class and you can explain to me how you went from lawyer to weathercaster.

Happy New Years again, and let's hope this year is better than the last!

Thank you for your kind words about our country and our people.  The horrific nature of this brutal crime still smolders in the ashes of the World Trade Center and yet the sight of Palestinians dancing in the streets or reading in Saturday's paper the stunning words from the Greeks of all people that we had somehow brought this upon ourselves.  Their country would be marching to the strains of "Heil Hitler" if we had not brought our military and economic might in to save Europe from its despots.

I am proud to be an American...! 

I could not agree more.  Every free and democratic country owes an incalculable debt to the US.  I admit I cried more than once on Tuesday, both for the tragedy and for the resulting selfless acts of humanity and sacrifice.  That is the amazing thing for me - from the absolute worst of mankind rose the absolute best of mankind.  I thought about you, and thought how proud you must be of your country, your fellow Americans, and your fellow New Yorkers.  I thought that in attacking New York the terrorists failed to consider New York's dominant characteristics - muticulturalism (50 to 100 Canadians are missing) and grit.  I must also comment that I have been uniquely impressed with the leadership and strength shown by Rudy Gulianni (sp?).  Finally, I couldn't help but think how fortunate the US is to have George Bush et al at the helm compared to the alternative.

Subj: Something to lift your spirits
This appeared in a Canadian newspaper is worth sharing

America: The Good Neighbor.
Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a
Canadian television commentator. What follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:

"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most
generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy we lifted out of
the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying
even
the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. When earthquakes hit distant
cities,
it is the United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 American
communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about
the decadent, warmongering Americans.

I'd like to see just one of those counties that is gloating over the erosion
of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country
in
the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star,
or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all
International
lines except Russia, fly American Planes? Why does no other land on earth
even consider putting a man or woman on the moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.

You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.

You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon - not
once, but several times - and safely home again.

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store
window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
and
hounded. Their are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are
breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma an pa at home
to
spend here. When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking
down
through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania
Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old
caboose. Both are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to
the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during
the San Francisco earthquake.

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired
of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with
their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at
the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is
not
one of those."

Mark,

GM wants us to look at this new NDA with an Exclusivity clause in it.   I will
look into the business side of agreeing to an Exclusivity clause within the automotive
sector for our proposition.  From your end, what has been the general position on exclusivity.
See agreement attached below.

Talk soon

It sounds ok to me.

Tana,

I just wanted to follow up on this issue to see if we can simply move these deals over to "Not to be confirmed.''  

Patrick

Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.  

Thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

Bill

Here is a list of all the trades with EGM.

Thanks,

I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.
	No idea. EGM doesn't exist.

Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?
Tana,

I was just following about these trades.

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick

Sheri,

This project is very important to me.  However, I am pulled on a very important project for the next several weeks and won't be able to look at this at all.

Can you take a look at all the Canadian Agreements listed on this list provided to us by BP and verify whether these agreements exist in Canada?

 

Tana, the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier is the 3rd last agreement on their list [so I'm not sure what #1 on their list is].  I'm not sure what the 2nd and 3rd agreements on their list are either.

We do, however, have an Interruptible Agreement dated May 26/94 [not on their list] and a Firm (<31 Day) Gas P/S Agreement dated August 1/94 [which is, I think, #5 on their list] with Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (now BP Canada Energy Company).  Do you want copies of these agreements?

I don't know what the other agreements are.

 << File: BP Canada Enron contract list.doc >> 

Sharon,

BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.  You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.

THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE!

You (as usual) are the best!

Tana, I have reviewed and revised the contract list you sent to me and attach my revision, blacklined to show the changes from the document you sent to me this morning.  There were a number of errors in the list as it pertained to Canada.  Of particular note is the inclusion in the list of a number of agreements with either Enron Oil Canada Ltd. (which was part of what is now EOG) or EOTT Canada.  As far as I am aware, Enron Corp. is no longer in any way affiliated or associated with either EOG or EOTT, having divested itself of any interest in either, and Enron Canada certainly has no knowledge of, involvement with or records pertaining to any of those agreements.  I do not believe that they should be included in any master netting agreement between BP and Enron.

In addition, it appears that they have listed the master physical gas agreement with ECC twice (I have deleted the first reference, being document number one) and they did not include the IT physical gas agreement with ECC, which I have added.

I hope this helps.

Thanks
Greg

Mary Cook wanted me to send you an email to make sure if you are sending the Master Netting Agreement out to counterparties that you delete the last page of the agreement, which contains the user notes.

Teresa,

By copy of this email, I am asking Stephanie Panus, another Paralegal in our group, to handle this for you as I am on working on a special project this week.

Stephanie, per Teresa's voicemail, Cinergy is very interested in getting a financial master in place to trade with us ASAP.  Can you please give their attorney a call.  Teresa, you forgot Mr. Gollomp's phone number.
Tana,

To follow-up with the message I left with you.  

Cinergy Services would like to transact on US East Financial Power product PJM Bal of Day and the new Cinergy Hourly Index (which is coming on-line soon).

I understand they don't have a Master Agreement under this entity.  The trader mentioned a "long form confirm", which is what is governing the trades they do with us OTC and is wondering if that would suffice.

Please call their attorney Mr. Jeff Gollomp to discuss.

Thanks for your assistance !

T.

Tana & Marie,

Please see HETCO's comments to our NDA on the redlined attached.   Let me know.

 John,
I have amended the draft as we discussed, and made a housekeeping change in the definition of "Amerada".
Contact me with any questions, and regarding execution.
Steve,
I hope this email gets through to you this time.   Rather than the Nov 1st or 2nd dates I list below, perhaps we can shoot for Nov. 19, 20,21 or Nov. 26 or 27th.   Hopefully, your legal group and my legal group can execute the NDA by those dates.    I will have a better answer for you regarding the structures of Enron's LJM and Chewco investment vehicles as soon as possible.  Please contact me with any concerns or questions.  Thanks again.

It was good speaking with you this morning.   I would like to cover a few housekeeper issues and to plan for our next meeting and the EnronOnLine (EOL) demonstation. 
Non-Disclosure Agreement
The demonstration will show you how the Market Manager programs work, the different behind-the-scenes administrative and data modules, and the screens a trader would use to load and trade on the system.    In order to show these proprietary functions and screens, my management is requiring third parties to sign a confidentiality agreement.   I have attached this agreement.   Please have your legal team review it and direct questions to Tana Jones, paralegal, at 713-853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, legal counsel, at 713-345-8897. 

Suggested Day and Time for the Meeting & Demonstration
How is November 1st or 2nd ?   What days are good for you and your team?

Format of the Demonstration
We can provide various ways to demonstrate EOL and its applications.  The simpliest way may be for HETCO to provide us with one or two desktops or laptops in order to view a remote, internet, demonstration from Houston, which would also feature an open phone line to my demo-team in Houston.  In this way, HETCO and Enron get a live demonstration of the EOL system, but avoid the IT headaches of opening up the necessary internet port and setting aside the required IP addresses, which are necessary if Enron were to bring its own laptops and projectors.   I can work with someone from your IT department to work out these details.
Thanks again for this opportunity.   Please reply or call me with any questions.     I look forward to our next meeting.

713-853-4587  

At the request of Jennifer Smith, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.

Re:
NYMEX ACCESS
 Order Entry

	NYMEX Rule 6.22, "Acceptance of Orders for Entry into NYMEX
ACCESS
," specifies the requirements for placement of orders into the
ACCESS
  system for all commodities (NYMEX and COMEX Divisions).  A copy of
the Rule is attached.  Section (C) of this Rule, "Acceptance of Orders From
Customers," specifically outlines the data necessary for input/placement of
orders, while Section (D), "Order Recordation," sets forth the procedures
for handling customer orders.

	All electronic traders are required to enter the correct account
number and clearing member number for all transactions with the exception of
multiple accounts.  NYMEX Rule 6.22(E), "Special Requirements," governs the
use of the "999" designation as it relates exclusively to multiple accounts.
Compliance Staff has additionally allowed for use of the "999" or common
holding account to be used on an "intra-session" basis for any account which
had not been set up prior to or during the ACCESS
 session in progress.  Use
of the "999" or common holding account may only be engaged on a one-time
basis for any account.  Thus, if "999" is designated three times in one
session related to three separate accounts for first time use of ACCESS
,
the "999" may never be subsequently designated for purposes of placing
orders for any of the three accounts.  Any misuse of the "999" or common
holding account would constitute a violation of Rule 6.22(C).

	The ACCESS
 System has enhanced functionality regarding the input
and storage of frequently used account numbers.  Electronic trading or
clearing member firms should contact the NYMEX Customer Service Center (the
"NCSC") with any questions at (800) 438-8616.

	Any questions regarding the rule requirements cited above should be
directed to Thomas LaSala, Vice President, Compliance, at (212) 299-2897, or
David Schneiderman, Director, Trade Practice Surveillance, at (212)
299-2857.

Rule 6.22. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FOR ENTRY INTO NYMEX ACCESS

 (A) DEFINITIONS-for purposes of these Rules, the following words shall have
the following definitions:

(1) "Matching System"-The NYMEX ACCESS
 programs and database that accept,
match and report executions of orders in NYMEX ACCESS
.

(2) "Strategy Pad"-The NYMEX ACCESS
 programs and database that may be used
by Electronic Traders and NYMEX ACCESS
 Operators to store orders, trading
strategies and other information, but that do not accept, match or report
execution of orders into the Matching System.

(B) No Clearing Member shall assign an account number that would accept the
entry of orders into NYMEX ACCESS
 for, or on behalf of, a customer, unless
such customer is first provided with an Electronic Trading and Order Routing
Systems Disclosure Statement in a form approved by the Exchange.

(C) ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS-No person or entity may accept an
order for execution on NYMEX ACCESS
 unless the following information is
received:

(1)   Commodity;

(2) Contract Month;

(3) Purchase or Sale;

(4) Customer Account Number (or certification that the order is for multiple
accounts to be later allocated);

(5) Quantity;

(6) Limit Price (except for stop, market discretion, MIT or market orders);

(7) Clearing Member (or certification that the order is for multiple
accounts to be later allocated);

(8) Strike prices, put or call (for options); and

(9) Any precondition for entry into the Matching System (i.e., stop, market
discretion, MIT, stop limit).

(D) ORDER RECORDATION-Immediately upon receipt, all customer orders for
execution on NYMEX ACCESS
 must be (1) entered into the Matching System or
Strategy Pad or, if such orders cannot be entered into the Matching System
or Strategy Pad within one minute of receipt, they must be (2) recorded
within one minute of receipt in non-erasable ink and time-stamped in
accordance with Rule 6.18, and entered into the Matching System or Strategy
Pad as soon as practicable.

(E) SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

(1)   For any order known to be an order for multiple accounts to be
allocated after execution, the Electronic Trader's Account Number followed
by the suffix "999" shall be entered in satisfaction of subsection (B)(4) of
this Rule.  Only a person with trading discretion over multiple accounts may
place an order with a Member Firm, Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESS

Operator to be allocated after execution. No Member Firm, Electronic Trader
or NYMEX ACCESS
 Operator may accept an order for allocation after execution
unless the Member Firm, Electronic Trader or NYMEX ACCESS
 Operator or their
employer has on file a prior, written procedure for the systematic and
non-preferential allocation of executions among accounts. The customer's
actual Clearing Member and Customer Account Number must be provided no later
than 8:30 a.m. following the NYMEX ACCESS
 trading session in which the
transaction was executed.

(2) No person may knowingly record false account number information in
connection with any NYMEX ACCESS
 order.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed, all orders received for execution on NYMEX
ACCESS
 shall be deemed to be cancelled if not executed during the trading
session for which they were received.

Bob Shults is Asking about that amendment to the Amerex Fee Agreement.  Can you help him...

I would like to attend.  God knows if Harry can/will come.  We'll see.  I did 12 (slow) miles last weekend...
Hey, Miss Tana,

Do you think you will make the party on Nov. 10 at Monnie's?????  Bring your
beau, too...

Let me know.

Patti

Running 12 miles was no problem.  Harry & I had a little "tiff" (I hope only) this weekend, and as usual, he's out of town, so we haven't been able to talk.  So who knows?

Is that a 'yes' or a 'no'?

What is up with Harry?

Good for you on running 12 miles.  How did you feel?

J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange. 

Tana,

Could you please provide me with an NDA that will cover discussions regarding the sale of DealBench.  This NDA would be similar to those that you put together for DealBench, PurchasePro and Thomsen Financial.  I would like to get a draft of this on Monday please.  I know that you usually email NDAs directly to the company, but I want to take a different approach on this one.  I have a meeting the CEO on Tuesday in which we will not discuss confidential info (just high level discussions).  If that meeting goes well, I want to have the NDA ready to go so we can move to the next stage of discussions quickly.  Please let me know if you need any other information besides the following:

James W. Pritchett, CEO

RE:		EXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP
TRANSACTIONS

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would lower
the cost of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions to $2.50 per
contract per side from $10 per contract per side and would apply the
discounted fee retroactively to the natural gas transactions conducted since
the start of the program yesterday.

We are gratified that the strong response to the introduction of this
trading instrument will allow us to so heavily discount the transaction fee.

The Exchange introduced EFS transactions in its natural gas futures market
yesterday as the first step of its plans to offer clearing services to the
over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  In its first full day, there
were 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.

EFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)
transactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution
of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on
pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures
contract.

EFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures
market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The
clearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the
Exchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the
futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties
involved.

Year-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately
60,000 contracts.  Yesterday's volume, including the EFS transactions was
73,364 natural gas futures contracts.

Steve asked me to send an email asking if you haven't already begun drafting your agreements yet, when you name you agreement, please indentify them by the counterparty and the products such as "Koch Energy-Gas" or "Aquila Marketing-Financing".  Thanks.

I have made a few "clean-up" changes to the Financial Adoption Agreement and incorporated some comments from Carol.

Please use the attached version for any Financial deals.  Thaks

  

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master.

Various discussions took place Friday afternoon as to advisability of inserting a provision designed to bind (or at least make an attempt to bind ) current Counterparty Guarantors to obligations under the Adoption Agreement/ERMT Master Agreements.  

A quick fix that "hopefully" does not significantly disrupt the work you may have already done on your Adoption Agreements is to insert the language contained in the attached document just below the signature lines of all Adoption Agreements, only in those cases where the Master being adopted is currently supported by a guaranty issued by Counterparty's parent or other credit support provider/guarantor.  The required revisions to the form language should be fairly self-explanatory, but please call me with any questions.

If you see problems with the specific language (not the idea) of the Addendum, please call me ASAP. 

Thanks for your understanding and assistance,

Steve

 

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master.

I don't know the answer to this.  Do you?
Tana,

You're the best person I know to answer the questions Cindy has regarding financial trading. Let me know if I can add anything.

Thanks,

Debbie

Hi Debbie, hate to bother you but I know that for physicals we built the interface to Global Contracts from RA to do this so EOL customers would only have to sign their GTC's once.  How did this work for financials, was it from a Tagg feed?  Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one?  Thanks Cindy

Workflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works.

When a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney, DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal.

DCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts.  The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.  

Issue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.

I have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.  

First of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?

Second,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate 
that the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.

**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is "Any".  But "Any" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that "Any" means "Any Global Product" ;"Any" means "anything".  

OK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.  If this happens, it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within 24 hours.  

Even if a contract is determined by DriveTrain,   there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct.

Please note that TAGG does not use contract numbers.  As such,  someone has to eyeball every deal and determine who is confirming the deal and if Enron is, which template format out of the hundreds available should be used.  The value in  DCAF can only be realized if the "someone" is removed from the processing. 

Bottom Line:  DCAF II  needs a way to determine who the confirming party is on every deal, the correct Governing Law, Arbitration,  and Jurisdiction .  For gas deals ,  the contract provides the relevant information.  The Global Products world is much more complicated.  

Decision:  If DCAF II is to use Global Contracts, there needs to be a project staffed by one or more persons 	      who spend the next couple of months working on the following responsibilities:

	1)	Determining and implementing  what upgrades to Global Contracts are required to support 
		Global Products

	2)	Making sure that the appropriate contracts are set up for all Houston and London trading 
		partners. 

	3)	Defining the business rules required to populate  the XML message with the appropriate 
		Contract Agreement Type  needed by GKCOM to determine the contract number.

	4)	 Defining a procedure that is executed when the deal kicks out of DriveTrain to determine what 
		the contract on the deal should be and enable it to be entered into MoneyPenny.

	5)	Setting up a means for testing this process prior to and as part of the User Acceptance Test.

I am still using the list.  I have to circulate the list to the team from time to time.

Tana,
Are you still using your list on Word for the Online and Offline NDAs or are you now only recording them in Lotus Notes under "Networks Agreements"?

Thanks!

Can you give me an ETA on this request?

Thanks,

Any decision on this customer's request?

Wendi/Tom,

Below is customer's email:

Aquila Broadband Services (ABS) is requesting that you please reauthorize
our ability to execute broadband trades with Enron.  We currently have the
ability to view the markets with our user ID, but we would like the access
to transact with Enron from both the bid and offer side.

Please let me know your decision.

Thanks,
Griff

Any idea who knows the answer to this question?

Tana, do you have some info on how the financial trades, esp related to EGM was done for Global Contracts so this did not impact EOL?  Thanks Cindy

Tana,

You're the best person I know to answer the questions Cindy has regarding financial trading. Let me know if I can add anything.

Thanks,

Debbie

Hi Debbie, hate to bother you but I know that for physicals we built the interface to Global Contracts from RA to do this so EOL customers would only have to sign their GTC's once.  How did this work for financials, was it from a Tagg feed?  Do you have any info on this I can send to Ron as I do not want to have to recreate the wheel on this one?  Thanks Cindy

Workflow in DCAF II for Global Products will require a number of changes to the Way DCAF II currently works.

When a deal is received by DCAF II from MoneyPenney, DCAF II will have to determine if the deal is to be confirmed and who the confirming party is on the deal.

DCAF II determines this by taking a contract number assigned to the deal and goes to Global Contracts.  The Contract identifies who is to confirm the deal.  

Issue:  Currently MoneyPenny does not capture Global Compliant Contract Numbers.  Cindy Horn indicated her understanding is that Global Product Deals traded on EOL have a Contract Number.  While it is true that a party may agree to a GTC when logging on to EOL,  it does not mean that there  is a contract set up in Global Contracts between the parties.   My understanding is that EOL stores a Global Compliant Contract Number for those parties that have Master Agreements with Enron recorded in Global Contracts.  When a deal is traded on EOL for these parties,  the Contract Number ( e.g., 96053367 ) is provided in the XML message sent to Sitara and MoneyPenney.    This needs to be verified.

I have had discussions with Tim Legget regarding the contract number issue and he suggests the following be done.  A buyer contract and a seller contract number edit fields will be provided in the MoneyPenney Capture windows.  The reason there is a buyer and seller contract number is because there are two contracts when internal parties trade with each other.  MoneyPenney will not require a contract number be entered.  When MoneyPenney sends the deal message to DCAF II via DriveTrain, DriveTrain will try to determine the contract number using the GKCOM service that was developed for this purpose.  The problem with this is that there may be a significant number of deals where this service cannot determine the contract for.  GKCOM uses the internal party, the external party, the product, the document type (e.g., Master Purchase Sale Firm ), the start and end date of the deal to try and find a contract.  

First of all,  who is going to tell GKCOM what kind of Contract Agreement to look for.  There a gazillion different types of contract agreements.   If MoneyPenney does not know what contract is covering the deal, how would it know to tell GKCOM what contract agreement type to look for?

Second,  a contract has to exist which matches the product on the deal.  There are a gazillion products traded in the Global Products world.  Every product has to be set up ( See ** ) under the contract that the counterparty could possibly trade.   Also,  there may be a need to set up several contracts for the same party.  Remember, DCAF II looks to the contract to determine who is confirming the deal.  For London deals, if the deal is  Petchems or MTBE, Enron confirms.  For some products, if it is a Brokered sale, then the Broker confirms - if it is a Brokered Purchase from Stasco, BP, Texaco, or Exxon/Mobile, then the Counterparty confirms - For all other Liquids, a Brokered Purchase is confirmed by the Broker.  Currently,  it is impossible to implement these business rules in Global Contracts.  Global Contracts does not have the ability to indicate 
that the broker is confirming if it is brokered versus someone else if the deal is not brokered.

**  You can  indicate in Global Contracts that the product is "Any".  But "Any" could conflict with contracts that need to be set for Gas, Power, and Industrial Markets.  That is, you can't indicate to Global Contracts that "Any" means "Any Global Product" ;"Any" means "anything".  

OK, so it is very likely that GKCOM cannot  provide a contract for all deals.  If that is the case, then the transaction will be kicked out - will not get to DCAF II - until someone becomes aware that the deal kicked out of DriveTrain and determines what the contract is and enters it into MoneyPenney.  If this happens, it is unlikely that the confirm will go out within 24 hours.  

Even if a contract is determined by DriveTrain,   there will a significant number of deals for which the confirming party designation is not correct.

Please note that TAGG does not use contract numbers.  As such,  someone has to eyeball every deal and determine who is confirming the deal and if Enron is, which template format out of the hundreds available should be used.  The value in  DCAF can only be realized if the "someone" is removed from the processing. 

Bottom Line:  DCAF II  needs a way to determine who the confirming party is on every deal, the correct Governing Law, Arbitration,  and Jurisdiction .  For gas deals ,  the contract provides the relevant information.  The Global Products world is much more complicated.  

Decision:  If DCAF II is to use Global Contracts, there needs to be a project staffed by one or more persons 	      who spend the next couple of months working on the following responsibilities:

	1)	Determining and implementing  what upgrades to Global Contracts are required to support 
		Global Products

	2)	Making sure that the appropriate contracts are set up for all Houston and London trading 
		partners. 

	3)	Defining the business rules required to populate  the XML message with the appropriate 
		Contract Agreement Type  needed by GKCOM to determine the contract number.

	4)	 Defining a procedure that is executed when the deal kicks out of DriveTrain to determine what 
		the contract on the deal should be and enable it to be entered into MoneyPenny.

	5)	Setting up a means for testing this process prior to and as part of the User Acceptance Test.

Can you please handle.  Thanks.
Tana, several months ago you & I worked on a NDA with a company called 3PARdata. The lawyers worked together and reached a version that was acceptable to both sides. However, for several reasons we did not sign it on the Enron side. I would like to resurrect this agreement with one change. I need to remove EnronOnline, LLC as one of the parties to the agreement. The agreement would be with Enron Net Works LLC and 3PARdata, Inc.

Representatives from 3PARdata will be here this Thursday (11/8) to disclose some confidential information. I would like to get our side signed and faxed to them before they COB Wednesday. I will take care of getting the Enron signature.

Please call me with any questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kevin Montagne

I wanted to let you know this was coming in as soon as Mark approves the changes.  Dealing with Japan is somewhat time challenging.

Please approve or make changes to their new NDA.  They need to change the counterparty name due to a joint venture.

Thanks,

-Dan

Diamond-san,

As I wrote in the past, Nissho Iwai's LNG related department
has been transferred into a new joint venture company between
Nissho and Sumitomo Corp. as of October 1, 2001, namely,
 "LNG Japan Corp.".

In this connection, we would like to conclude another NDA with
LNG Japan Corp, as per attached.

Please review it and it would be great if you could make original again
and send us for Mr.Miyazawa's signature.

Also, please advise us how we should treat Nissho's NDA in these
circumstances.

BTW, I talked with Mr.Matsubara, Manager of Enron Global Finance in Tokyo.
We are internally discussing when we start our official meeting.
Please let us know when you are ready.

Regards,

LNG Japan Corporation
D.Kobayashi

Name of Company:  ERMT LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

Address:  1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas  77002

Branches:  only relates to those branches of a multibranch party, which under ISDA can ONLY be a bank.

Restrictions:  Things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading, payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it.  It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.  Examples would be:  "masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only", "no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions", "no oral trades allowed", "only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company", "all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures".  You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.  But we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff.  Just critical, DON'T TRADE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF.

Hi Tana

I am entering my first ISDA on the database and have a couple of questions and because the database is your baby I thought it best to ask you.

Branches: does that mean Enron branches and/or counterparty branches?
Restrictions: does that mean whether we have included for example FX and Currency provisions?

Kind regards,
Anna Fox

So far I'm on if I don't have to work.  Harry and I broke up on Monday.

I know you probably don't have much time for emails right now, but are you
still on for Sat.?  Is Harry coming with you?

Talk later.

Done.

Credit has advised me that they gave the OK to increase tenor from 24 to 25 for US Gas products.  Have you had a chance to review?  

thanks, Kathy

Hi Tana,

I was just wondering if you could assist with the status of the following PA's.  I understand these are awaiting approval by Legal and Contracts, Houston, having already been approved by Credit, Sydney:

	Company			Name			Date Submitted

You do not have to grant Nakesha access.  She already has view only access as does any Enron employee.  If you show her how to set up an icon to get into the database, she should be able to get view access to the database.  All Enron employees have view access.  Only employees of Legal and Credit can have edit access access.  Does that help?

Tana,

The only information that I have pertaining to Nekesha is what I could find in People Finder.  I hope this helps.

We are trying to get a Master Netting Agreement in place tomorrow with various AEP companies.  ECTRIC has several trading agreements in place with AEP entities.  We need someone in London to verify that we are referencing the ECTRIC agreements correctly in the Master Netting Agreement.  I am faxing the first two pages of the Master Netting Agreement to Edmund's attention at fax number 011-44 20-7783-8667.  Can one of you please take a look at this in the morning and verify that the information referenced in the agreement is correct since we do not have a copy of your agreements.

Much thanks!

Edmund Cooper is the only person that has keyword access to add legal people, credit people, companies, or change other drop downs in the database.  I have key word access on this side of the Atlantic and Edmund has it there.  If you need London Credit people added that aren't listed already you need to have Edmund go add them, or the company as a new key word.

Hi Tana

I am putting on the Financial Trading Agreements database ISDAs that are currently under negotiation and have a couple of questions (sorry Matt is away today).

Where the Credit Contact is not listed under the arrows how do I add a new one? I have the same problem with an Enron entity - EFET LLC is not on there.

Hope you are surviving OK over there.

Do I need to help you getting this out?
Lorie -

Sorry for the typo and misspellings.  I have reviewed the agreement again and made changes to Paragraphs 7 and 8.  I have attached the final version below.  

As to getting this out today, that is fine.  Since I will need to initial the final letters, why don't we generate them up here and send them down for signature.  You can then attach the pricing and product description items.

Mark

 << File: loi-chisholm(11-12-01mlg).doc >> 

Mark,

Hope you had a good weekend and thanks for the quick response.

There were a few misspellings of names and a typo which we have changed.  The only question I have is in paragraphs 7 & 8, we still refer to a Term Sheet, should this be changed to Product Description? please advise.

Lorie/Carl -

Pursuant to our discussion, I have attached an updated draft of the LOI.  I have not attached either the product description nor the pricing schedule as this can be accomplished once we finalize the LOI.

Please take look at the attached and let me know if there are any further comments or questions.

Who was this passed on to for handling?
Hi Tana,

A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  

Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  

Thanks,
Diane

PS - Go Levittown!

Please see attached.

I don't have any record or receiving any such assignment and I checked with the other paralegals and they don't have a record of receiving it.  Can you have Mirant resend it to Samantha Boyd, as she is the paralegal handling the paralegal assignment rotation right now.  Sorry about that!

Tana:  

I did not receive documentation regarding this assignment nor has it been logged in by one of the other Paralegals.

I faxed you the alcoa ISDA immediately after we spoke.  It should be in NY right now.

Tana,

The instructions don't work, and quite frankly, I don't have the luxury of waiting for an IT guy to help me.  Is it possible for you to print out the Alcoa isda and fax it to me at the below fax number?  I need it on an urgent priority basis.  If you can't fax it to me, please let me know.

Thanks,

Limor,

The instructions below should help you find the access to get into the Financial Trading Agreement Database (where the ISDA information is located).   If you want to get into where the documents are actually stored online, you need to contact Moyez Lallani, and he can get you access to Livelink.  Tell him you are in Legal in New York and you need access ASAP.  Then just have your computer guy up there set up up an Icon.
Put this in a safe place!

Instructions:

From your Lotus Notes Workspace choose File - Database - Open.  This will bring up the Open Database Dialog (shown below).  In the Server drop down list, choose "ECTHOU_LN1/ECT".  Once this is selected, find and double-click on the "Legal" folder.  Next, in the Database list, find the "Financial Trading Agreements" database and double-click (or click Open).  The database will then be added to your Lotus Notes Workspace.

Per my conversation with Stephanie and Wendi, the counterparty would like the counterparty to start trading on EOL by tomorrow.  The three entities are:

2.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Ameren Generating Company
3.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Central Illinois Public Services Co. (d/b/a AmerenCIPS)

What if anything do we need to to to ensure that they can start trading by tomorrow.  The counterparty is calling me daily checking on this?  Can you please let me know?

Notice No. 01-409
November 29, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms
		All Clearing Members

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		TEMPORARY EXCHANGE OF OPTIONS FOR OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS IN
ENERGY MARKETS

The Exchange will introduce a temporary program beginning tomorrow that will
allow participants in its energy markets to exchange over-the-counter (OTC)
options positions for options positions on the Exchange (EOO).

This program will have a fixed 30-day time limit and will end on December
28.

EOO transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical and
exchange of futures for swaps transactions.  Two parties are allowed to
privately negotiate the execution of on- and off-exchange options positions
on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties. The transactions must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
options exposures in the same or related commodities.

These transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer
options market positions between the two parties involved in the
transaction. The clearing member representing each party will be responsible
to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of options contracts involved,
the price at which the transaction should be cleared, and the identity of
the parties involved.

As you requested, I am enclosing a revised Mutual form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  As I stated in my earlier email, if you have any comments or questions, please call me at (713) 853-3399, or Anne Koehler, Senior Counsel at (713) 853-3448.

 

 

Janet,

Unfortunately, the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide copies of the agreement to affiliates.  We will need the permission of Merita before I can provide a copy to you.

Dear Tana
Please could you provide me with a copy of the ISDA in place between Nordea Bank (previously Merita) and ENA.
Many thanks
Janet
Can one of you guys have a look into the ISDA situation with Nordea Bank (formerly Merita). They had an ISDA with ENA but I believe that we are in the process of transfering it to ECTRIC.

A progress report would be appreciated.

Cheers

Darren

I need to know who you are talking to at Merita Bank.

That is fine as I understand that it was Merita's suggestion that we use the ENA document as a starting point.  

As ENA is the contracting party presumably the request for permission should come from you. Please let me or Darren Gurner know if you need any assistance.

thank you
Janet

I have attached for your final review and approval copies of the NDA - both redlined and clean.  The redlined version incorporates the changes that were last suggested in August and also reflects the item we discussed yesterday.  

If these are acceptable, please advise me accordingly and I will have originals printed, signed by Enron and forwarded to Sabine for completion.

Thanks for your assistance.

Robyn -

I have reviewed your comments on the NDA between our companies.  I have
attached a revised version which incorporates your changes and reflects
- as redlined - the additional changes I have made.

The language you initially provided for the end of Paragraph 1 (relating
to notice prior to disclosure for legal process) was too restrictive as
it would seem to require that the disclosing party either be able to
obtain some proctective order or waive confidentiality prior to the
receiving party being able to disclose the legally required information.
Since a legal requirement of disclosure is an exception to the
non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions, a waiver of compliance
with the agreement by the disclosing party would not be necessary.

Please review the attached at your convenience.  If these changes are
acceptable, please advise me accordingly and I will arrange to have
final agreements forwarded to your attention for signature by Sabine.

Thanks.

Thank you for working with us to get the Mutual NDA expedited.  Our meeting
next Tuesday in Houston will be far more productive with both sides open to
discussing all the challenges ahead.

Attached is the agreement that Enron N.A. worked up with Organic the last

numerous revisions before being executed.

I'm in town all week so please don't hesitate to call or email me direct.

Larry has forwarded your name as the appropriate initial contact.  I
would like to follow up with you about where we could work together.
Larry has had several conversations internally about a year ago, but our
business goals have changed significantly since that time.  I am
available most of the week.  My direct line is (713) 345 - 8913.

					-Brandon Wax

I will be out of the office most of next week but would be happy to meet
with you later. Suggest you start by contacting Michael Ereli our VP of
Technology.

I think the easies way to get me the approval is for your contact to go talk to the contact at Merita we negotiated the ISDA with and have them send me an email or fax telling me it is OK to release the ISDA to you.  The woman at Merita we negotiated with was Paivi Saarnilahti and her phone number is 358 9 1655 9258.
Tana

I am speaking to the trader in Finland. See attachment below.

Darren
Please could you reply directly to Tana.  I am out of the office tomorrow.
regards
Janet

I need to know who you are talking to at Merita Bank.

That is fine as I understand that it was Merita's suggestion that we use the ENA document as a starting point.  

As ENA is the contracting party presumably the request for permission should come from you. Please let me or Darren Gurner know if you need any assistance.

thank you
Janet

Janet,

Unfortunately, the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide copies of the agreement to affiliates.  We will need the permission of Merita before I can provide a copy to you.

Dear Tana
Please could you provide me with a copy of the ISDA in place between Nordea Bank (previously Merita) and ENA.
Many thanks
Janet
Can one of you guys have a look into the ISDA situation with Nordea Bank (formerly Merita). They had an ISDA with ENA but I believe that we are in the process of transfering it to ECTRIC.

A progress report would be appreciated.

Cheers

Darren

Just a note...

I have not gotten that ISDA Master out yet because there are some things in the credit worksheet that don't jive with the credit terms in the current master as well as credit terms generally consistent on this side of the Atlantic.  I have asked Jay Williams in our Credit Dept. here to get with the credit person there in London who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms.  I have drafted the ISDA with everything except making the credit choices so it sits there waiting for credit.

Just wanted to keep you updated...

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Monday, December 03, 2001.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $4,500)			=
$4,500
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN	(1 * $4,000)			=	-

Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice

Tana -

Could you please prepare an NDA for Deloitte Consulting (at the Boston address that is in the Jake Staffle NDA) for CommodityLogic.  The subject matter should be generic as they are looking at Deloitte to provide some basic accounting and compliance auditing services.

Thanks.

No, the last note I have is proving the revised NDA for you to send to them.  No word since then.

Tana:

Any contact from Citi on the NDA?

Mike,

I'll look look into our schedule and follow-up with legal on the NDA.  I

At the request of Anne Koehler, I am transmitting the final draft of the referenced Guaranty.

 

I am sorry, but I checked with the lawyer, and we are going to need that executed Agreement and we are going to need it as fast as you can track it down...sorry to keep being such a pest!
Tana, in answer to your question, the Amendent was executed, Mike, for some reason, just does not have an executed copy.  Can you go forward on the assumption that it is executed?

Christy

It was executed.  For some reason I don't have an executed copy.

Mike, I copied the documents and had them delivered to Tana Jones.  I noticed at the time that there was one amendment for gas and one for power, as I heard you tell Jim.  I noticed that the copy of the gas one in the file was executed, while the one for power was not.

Tana just called and said she noticed the same thing and wondered if the Power Amendment had been executed.  Do you know if it was and we just did not have the copy in the file?  Thanks for your help.

Good Morning Everyone,

In order to make access easier in connection with the our financial trading forms, Mary Cook has asked that the SWAP FORMS directory be divided into two (2) subdirectories as follows:

		(b)	Old 

Therefore, if any of you wishes to access (a) the current forms used, or (b) the old forms now retired from use, just access as follows:

	Current Forms:	O:\Legal\ATTY.FMS\SWAP FORMS\Current

I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.

Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks!

 

Any conflicts?
Here's the info on the two Russian companies.
The first is a large oil company, and the second is a consultant.
We are talking to them at lunchtime today about a private e-marketplace.
I apologize for the 11th hour nature of this.

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

at Owen Graduate School of Management (Vanderbilt University) with a Finance
concentration, I am looking for a Summer Associate position at Enron.

The area of my particular interest is Enron's risk management products
(commodity derivatives research and trading). Graduating from Novosibirsk
State University with major in physics, I am eager to apply my experience
with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the
managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading
models. I strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with
undergraduate background in physics, solid work experience in finance and
proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to Enron as a
Summer Associate.

I think I found a small mistake there. URL of this page is

<http://www.ect.enron.com/products/risk/margin_intro.fset.html> (producer

The second sentence of the paragraph beginning with "Paradigm and Enron

states the following.

For example, if the actual margin is $1.25/MMBtu for a given month, then
Paradigm will pay Enron $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is
$2.00/MMBtu, then Enron will pay Paradigm $0.62/MMBtu.

I believe, if I am reading it correctly, the money should flow in the
opposite direction, namely:

Enron will pay Paradigm $0.13/MMBtu. Alternatively, if the actual margin is

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with 
Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor 
fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

experience.  Publications are available on request.

trying to locate

Alex

Steve,

Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards 
understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no
bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated
credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the 
code.

Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points. 

1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work
and she does not have the
necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help. 
It's
not that the work is beneath her.

2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston.
He effectively told them to go away and work on the "research projects"
and that he would take care of the IT issues. I don't think that it's just 
Tanya's issue,
though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.

3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on 
Tanya and
me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively
disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the
demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya
to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.

The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and
Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that 
it happens.
Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and
the system cannot fail.

Vince

Vince,

I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking 
about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular 
distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of 
multiple languages etc....

Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous 
occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?

The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current 
system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main 
development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved 
and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had 
a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation 
to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something 
they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I 
believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical 
people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively 
meaningless metric like portability.

On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted 
by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei 
is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working 
with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to 
find a common Valuation piece between the systems.

I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some 
time over the next few days?

Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our 
discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to 
all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. 
Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.

She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could 
get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would 
measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by 
inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling 
tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping 
through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that 
studying documentation wasn't enough. 

About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to 
psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. 
(in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and 
Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT "working together" document, 
which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.

Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do 
all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to 
do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT 
guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as 
it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is 
claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she 
continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and 
doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could 
be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and 
an IT issue and ask for help from research.

I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.

I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together 
over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their 
progress on Friday. 

In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that 
doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer 
term solution.

Regards

Steve

Christie,

I have two persons in my group helping me with the Wharton and
Rice projects. By the way, the project I gave to Rice students is
exactly the same as the project for Wharton. We shall see who is better.

Their names are Li Sun  and Kenneth Parkhill.
Can we invite them to the dinner on the 18th and to the meetings
on Friday?

Vince

Martin, 

Please, ask Steve to call your office.
I may be late on Friday. I don't have to be present at
this conference call. Please, talk about your potential
involvement and if takes a trip to London it's OK with me.

Dear Vince:

     Happy New Year.

      Does Enron have a program for hiring summer interns?  My daughter
Candice Kao is a freshman at Mount Holyoke College.  She has a good quan
aptitude and quite meticulous.  She is looking for summer intership in
Houston.  So if you know such a program existing, please let me know.
She is in town for the semester break if there is such a program, may
be she can visit with someone there to have an interview.

      With best regards,  Ed

Hi Vince,
?
I promise to contact you next time just for a chat  instead of askig you to 
do someting again! Robin e-mailed me today about the  next EPRM article, whih 
was timely as I have just completed this draft. Please  could you cast you 
eye over the article and let me have any comments as soon as  possible?
?
Are you happy to continue with these articles? We  are very happy at our 
continued association with yourself.
?
Best regards for 2001.
?
Chris.

Molly,

Sandeep Kohli called last night.  We decided to transfer Anshuman
for the 6-month trial period and then extend his assignment
to a permanent employment if necessary. For Sandeep Kohli
it's a permanent transfer, effective immediately.

Some local opposition to poaching of good people.

I shall start working with you.

Zimin,

Can you interview this guy? Maybe Tanya, a math Ph.D. can help as well.

Vince

Zimin, 
Happy new year! 
The financial trading group is looking at a potential candidate for a general 
financial trading position in Japan and was wondering if someone from your 
area wouldn't mind testing this candidates mathematical skills. She has a 
Masters in Stochastic Mathematics  and both a math/liberal arts undergrad. I 
feel it is important to test her grasp of the subjects she would have studied 
and know that someone from your area would be best suited in providing some 
feedback on this. 
The candidate's name is Yumi Imokawa. If you don't mind, could I please 
schedule a telephone interview for 20 minutes or so? The ideal time is Tokyo 
mornings (so for example, at 5:00 in the evening Houston time any day that 
you are available..I will just have the candidate call your point person 
directly.

Sincerely,
Darren

meet will start before and continue thereafter.

I am very honored you will be able to join me.

Sincere thanks!

Vince would like to continue his "project meeting" that was cut short this
morning.  The area to be discussed is the Researh reorganization.  We
would like to have schedule this meeting for this Friday, January 12th at

Please let me know if you have a problem with this.  Osman will be in

Vince,

Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk 
to Jeff Shankman on Monday.

Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, 
who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for 
promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is 
also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real 
asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, 
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in 
Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would 
be a good number to call you on.  

I look forward to working with the team in Research.

Thanks again,

Regards,
Sandeep.

Denise Furey
01/08/2001 11:46 AM
I believe all of you received a request from Jeremy Blachman to hold the 
afternoon of January 10th open for an off-site to discuss the manner in which 
RAC and Research assess/test the credit quality of EES transactions.   I 
realize that RAC and EES have had many discussions as to the methodology, but 
it might be helpful for all of us to understand the actual derivation of some 
of analysis.    Please call me with any questions or comments at ext # 30349.

The agenda will be as follows:

12:00 - 1:00 Lunch
1:00 - 3:30   Presentations
3:30 - to close  Discussion

RAC/Research Presentations

The following topics would be of interest to EES:

1 -  The derivation of default probabilities including  (Research)
 - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process,
 - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for 
Enron,
 - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ (in respect 
to actual default rates, shape of the cumulative default curves etc.

2 -  The volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for 
the commodity portion of EES deals including (Research)
 - - the selection of curves
 - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and
 - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products.

3  -  The recovery rates used in the credit reserve model.   How are these 
figures derived? (RAC)

4  -  How RAC and Research have adjusted the credit reserve model to 
accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including  (RAC)
 - - promotion payments,
 - - accounts receivable
 - - committed capital
 - - and other factors

EES also understands that some of you may be familiar with our processes, 
however, there are perhaps areas that you would like to understand more 
fully.   Please tell us what you would like to hear from us.

Also, RAC has sent us the credit reserve model and I have seen completed 
models.   Perhaps prior to our meeting on Wednesday,  someone from RAC and/or 
Research could sit with me and someone from Phil Layton's group and go 
through the process of how the various pieces are put together. 

Sam, 

Yes, let's omit the guys who left the company, but we can include
the summer interns.

Vince

   

Vince,

Sounds good!  It will take two or three days for me to strip out, reformat, 
and assemble the Kaminski columns(since we didn't do this last year, I'm 
guessing you mean all columns since the beginning), so I envision us being 
ready with the completed set the first part of next week.  I assume that you 
would like me to omit those people who have moved on?

Also,  on page three of the first volume, you had written an introduction.  I 
have updated  the content for volume two, but would you perhaps like to do a 
new one?

Sam

Vince J Kaminski@ECT

Mark Frevert
Greg Whalley
Rick Buy
Jeff Shankman

Also, we can add additional volume for Kaminski's columns (just 10 copies),
including bios and my contributions.
I would like to show the depth of talent we have in the group.

Vince

   

Vince,

I have successfully integrated Martin's article into Volume II and am 
following Mike's instructions for reproduction.  I'm also having some 
additional Volume I's printed, too.  Would you mind disposing of the other 
set I gave you?  I wouldn't want things to get confused.  Also, I'm doing 20 
Volume I's and 60 Volume II's.  Please let me know how many you personally 
need and I will deliver them to your office.

Thank You,

Sam

Vince,

I have successfully integrated Martin's article into Volume II and am 
following Mike's instructions for reproduction.  I'm also having some 
additional Volume I's printed, too.  Would you mind disposing of the other 
set I gave you?  I wouldn't want things to get confused.  Also, I'm doing 20 
Volume I's and 60 Volume II's.  Please let me know how many you personally 
need and I will deliver them to your office.

Thank You,

Hello Shmuel,

Thanks for your message. The end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were 
extremely busy 
and I could not focus on PSERC issues. I shall consult a few people in Enron 
on this subject and get in
touch with you. Our concern right now is that the results of research are 
widely shared with
our competition.

I am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me. I would be glad to 
cover the cost of your Austin
to Houston trip.

Regarding your son. The Analyst / Associate program will interview again on 
the campus
in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him.

Hello Vince
Happy Holidays.
I wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of Enron Joining
PSERC. As you might have heard from Lance and Alex we are going through a
transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry
members within the last year. Consequently, our business processes are not
well developed. One of the problems we are facing is the balance between the
electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested
in market related research. I hope to recruit more of the later so tat we
have more of a constituency in the Advisory Board  that sees the value of
market related research. I already have a verbal commitment from people at
Electrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC. With members like
Electrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projects
such as the one that Shijie Deng proposed (not funded in this round). Please
let me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron. I am
going to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing and
could come through Huston for a visit. Attached are some items that I shared
with our PSERC members and thought that you might be interested in them as
well.
Regards, Shmuel.

> The following are 3 items that demonstrate the impact of PSERC research in

Dear Mike

I would like to apply for the above position as advertised in "EARTHWORKS" and
enclose my full CV (In Word 97/00 format) in support.

I am currently a research Fellow with UCL conducting research, and building
forecasting models for the statistical prediction of North Atlantic Sea 
Surface
Temperatures and other climatic parameters at long leads (1-12 months ahead of
forecast period).

I have recently applied this model to the North Sea in order to aid long-lead
forecasts of Fish Stocks (see SAP-symposium, 4-6 December, Bergen, Norway), 
and
have recently been applying similar models to the North Atlantic Oscillation, 
an
atmospheric phenomena which is strongly correlated with winter climate over
UK/Norway and NW Europe, particularly temperatures, rainfall and windspeeds 
(see
enclosed poster which was presented recently at an international conference on
the NAO in Vigo, Spain)

As you will see from my CV, I have 2+ years experience consulting in several
areas of geoscience to the oil, gas and minerals industries and have good
programming skills, both on Unix machines and on PCs.

I am particularly keen to apply my skills in the commercial sector and 
initiate
a permanent career path.

I look forward to the opportunity of hopefully discussing my skills further 
with
you in the near future.

Yours sincerely

Tony Hamilton

Vince,

Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk 
to Jeff Shankman on Monday.

Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, 
who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for 
promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is 
also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real 
asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, 
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in 
Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would 
be a good number to call you on.  

I look forward to working with the team in Research.

Thanks again,

Regards,
Sandeep.

Kathy,

Enron will be represented by myself (Vince Kaminski) and Kenneth Parkhill.

I was interested in signing up for the 2/27 PJM training, but found out the 
class was full.  After calling PJM, they told me that you were the only other 
person at Enron signed up for the course.  I was just curious, if I could sit 
with you and do the training at the same time since it is done over the 
computer.

If this is a problem, I understand.  Just thought I would ask.

Dear Vince:
?
After a very great deal of thought, I have decided  to stick it out with El 
Paso. 
?
Please be assured that this exercise was not a  "fishing expedition" to 
extract concessions from El Paso.? Rather, it is  simply that, although I 
continue to harbor doubts about some of El Paso's  methods and about the 
people running the business, I have concluded that two  months is not enough 
time to fully judge the company.? I feel that I have  not yet given El Paso 
(or myself for that matter) a fair chance.? After  all, if I disagree with 
the way the business is run, I should regard that as an  opportunity to 
effect changes and not an excuse to run away.
?
Please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to  all those who worked so 
hard over the holidays to produce the offer: David  Oxley, Sheila Walton, and 
especially Norma Villarreal.
?
And thanks also to you Vince for your patience,  humor, and good advice.? As 
I've said before, I consider it an honor to be  able to call you a colleague 
and friend.
?
With Best  Regards,
Grant.

I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their 
thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.  
Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by 
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the 
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and 
I will follow through on that if you would like.  

Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good 
one for you.  --Sally

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for Enron's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have Enron participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.

Vince/Stinson,

Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as 
well as the revised statement that can be made to press.

The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of 
the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the 
gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating 
in homes, and commercial establishments.

Hope ths helps.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Michael,

I think that Keynes was right on the money.
He had great insights into the forward markets.

By  the way, what are your thoughts about CA?

Vince

Did you guys get this?

I was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about
risk/return & valuation of assets for utilities.  I thought I would mention to
you, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually use
classical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decision
is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is the
President's curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is the
customers' curves or equivalently the PUC's curve.

I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the
assumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM for
large industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utility
curves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.

Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its
role in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most market
participants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higher
than spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lower
than spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers
(including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for the
certainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lower
bid prices.

Just some random thoughts,
Michael

Amitava,

Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its 
scope.  I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that 
we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust 
model off more comprehensive data to start with.

Cheers,
Scott

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our 
final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts 
with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following 
the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for 
the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and 
default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs 
covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 
quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots           Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12 
month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month 
end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end 
performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12 
month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the 
performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ 
days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big 
picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for 
analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a 
modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Regards,
Amitava

Chonawee,

This was perfectly all right. As a matter of fact I expect and encourage
the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else) 
on any subject. I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation
of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s
convictions.

Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The only
way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the
company) is by having open communication.  In Enron,
facts are friendly.

By the way, it was an excellent presentation.

Vince

Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON

Hi Vince, I am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions. 
Vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same 
expected revenue to the auctioneer. (Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid, 
and second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the 
valuation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction, 
everyone bids at his own valuation. Hence, the winner pays the valuation of 
the second highest bidder. In English auction, the second highest valuation 
bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation. Hence, the 
winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder.
Thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions.

Hello Vince

I wanted to forward the following invitation to you.  We are putting the 
Technologists through an orientation which includes a few days with the 
Analyst program - and the following is one of the events that they have 
scheduled on Jan. 16th.  I wanted to forward to you as more of an FYI since 
we do not have any Cal Berkeley candidates starting on Jan. 8th.  Also - we 
are starting to set some of the events on campus for the Spring - so we 
should probably get together soon.  Please let me know what works best for 
you!

Thanks,
Ashley

Jeff,

We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the 
numbers you have 
requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on 
the power situation in India
published by The Financial Times. 

The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting 
millions of people.
One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due 
to  power
shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost 
of power produced
by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230 
million people.

The second article is Enron specific.

Vince

               
    
                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India 
                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By ANGUS DONALD

                     Tens of millions of people were left without electricity 
in northern India
                     yesterday after a power grid breakdown. 

                     Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and 
most parts of the
                     capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply 
expected to be restored
                     by the end of the day, according to power grid 
officials. 

                     The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(Assocham), a
                     leading business organisation, expressed "deep concern" 
and called for a
                     mechanism to prevent future disruption that could 
"cripple the economy". 

                     The power failure across eight Indian states, including 
New Delhi, disrupted
                     train services, water supplies and the telephone network 
and forced
                     hospitals to switch to emergency generators. 

                     The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides 
electricity for 226m
                     people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana, 
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
                     Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu 
and Kashmir. 

                     A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, 
India's most
                     populous state, caused an overload of power on other 
lines, which then
                     failed as well. 

                     Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals 
systems were
                     damaged. New Delhi international airport was also 
slightly affected before
                     its own power supply could be engaged. 

                     "We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is 
most likely to be a
                     technical failure, but we will investigate why it 
happened," Suresh Prabhu,
                     the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust 
of India. 

                     India suffers regularly from power problems because of 
lack of funding to
                     upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big 
problem. Thirty per
                     cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according 
to analysts. In New
                     Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen. 

                     Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh 
and Delhi for
                     hours. 

                     Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing 
industrial demand
                     would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's 
inefficient power
                     sector. "The slow progress, particularly in 
strengthening the transmission
                     and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Energy group launches image offensive: 
Enron has a
                     plan to reverse its reputation as a profiteering 
multinational
                     operating in India, writes Khozem Merchant 

                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By KHOZEM MERCHANT

                     Enron, the US energy producer and a constant target of 
criticism in India, is
                     hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a 
profiteering
                     multinational. 

                     Its "myth and reality" offensive in local newspapers 
follows the west Indian
                     state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it 
pays the Texas-based
                     company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating 
plant at Dabhol is
                     India's biggest single foreign investment. 

                     Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993 
and is three times
                     greater than that charged by other independent power 
producers (IPPs).
                     The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the 
rupee against the
                     dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha 
fuel. The state also pays
                     a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, 
reflecting the
                     huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of 
consumption. 

                     A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six 
years ago that
                     damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former 
official of the World
                     Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is 
emerging "as the East
                     India Company of the 21st century" - a reference to the 
British trader that
                     colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th 
century. 

                     The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power 
sector. The UK's PowerGen
                     and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, 
frustrated by long approval
                     procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of 
higher
                     returns elsewhere. 

                     "India has lost time and opportunity and has driven 
returns down by six
                     percentage points," says Gerry Grove-White, former India 
general manager
                     of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat 
to China Light &
                     Power of Hong Kong. 

                     India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says 
generating capacity
                     must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 
1992, IPPs have
                     added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under 
construction. This is
                     insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 
per cent economic
                     growth. 

                     Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, 
winning fast-track project
                     approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant 
fuelled by expensive
                     naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a 
Dollars 1.87bn plant
                     of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied 
natural gas (LNG),
                     will be completed this year. Only two of seven other 
fast-track proposals
                     have achieved financial closure. 

                     From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating 
in Maharashtra's
                     then nationalist government cancelling the project 
before renegotiating
                     terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister 
of the successor
                     government, says the power purchase agreement is 
unaffordable. 

                     Enron, whose attackers also include cultural 
chauvinists, wants to maintain
                     good political relations in a hostile but lucrative 
environment. Enron views
                     India as a testing ground for its evolution from a 
traditional manager of
                     power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, 
such as energy, gas
                     and bandwidth. 

                     To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy 
between power
                     surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed 
this year. It is building
                     an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural 
gas. And it is
                     laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth 
space in a country
                     desperately short of this new economy commodity. 

                     In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight 
contract. It is supported by
                     many that believe any subversion of the contract would 
confirm investor
                     perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and 
industrial hub, as an
                     unreliable destination for investment. 

                     Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his 
predecessor, which
                     threatened to "dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea" - is 
under pressure from
                     radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options 
are limited.
                     Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an 
economically troubled state
                     that would have to compensate shareholders. 

                     Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility 
and Enron's main
                     client, is obliged to dispatch or "off-take" 90 per cent 
of Dabhol's output. Yet
                     MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take 
has averaged 60
                     per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has 
been paying a lot
                     more while consuming a lot less power. 

                     One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough 
new regulator has
                     told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the 
tariff would be
                     Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But 
with off-take a
                     third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and 
often higher. In
                     October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take 
was about 49 per
                     cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, 
run on cheaper
                     LNG, starts. 

                     These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only 
half of a 30 per
                     cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the 
balance and
                     mandated bankers to find a buyer. 

                     Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, 
which have failed to
                     deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared 
they would never be
                     paid by state generating boards that have become a 
byword for corrupt
                     management of power. 

                     Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic 
pricing means
                     industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as 
transmission and
                     distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and 
technical losses, is
                     overdue. "Given the limited resources, money would be 
better spent on T&D
                     rather than on new plant," says Oliver Blackaby, 
managing director of N M
                     Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the 
privatisation of its
                     distribution network. 

                     For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to 
satisfy the
                     competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay 
Bhatnagar, chief
                     executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade 
magazine, one of the
                     key lessons learned from phase 2 is "having flexibility 
to deal with
                     externalities".

Hello Team,

I hope that everyone had a wonderful and restful holiday season.  

Down to business:  The University Affairs group is putting together a tiger 
team of students to do a project for Enron.  Those students will be in town 
on January 18th and will be having dinner at Churrasco's that night.  I think 
it would be a great opportunity for some of the Wharton alum to come out and 
meet the participants, talk about Enron and eat some good food.  :-)  If you 
are interested in participating please RSVP to me via email or at extension 
53214 no later than 1/5/01.  

Thank you and hope to see you soon,

ITS WORTH PASSING ON - PLEASE REMEMBER IT.

Let's say it's 6:15 p.m. and you're driving home (alone of course), after an
unusually hard day on the job. You're really tired, upset and frustrated.
Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to
radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw. You are only about five
miles from the hospital nearest your home, unfortunately you don't know if
you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do? You've been trained in
CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected to tell you how to perform
it on yourself.

HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE

(Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article
seemed in order.) Without help, the person whose heart stops beating
properly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before
losing consciousness. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing
repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each
cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum
from deep inside the chest. A breath and a cough must be repeated about
every two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is
to be beating normally again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and
coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The
squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this
way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. Tell as many other people
as possible about this, it could save their lives!

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for Enron's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have Enron participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,

Attached are the spreadsheet for the Credit Exposure model and the XLL file.  
We have
performed some tests and the numbers looked reasonable. However, more 
extensive
testing using realistic data is needed. We would like to pass the model to 
you so you can
have someone check it more extensively and compare the model  with what you 
are using.
Also, please kindly inform me of any suggestions to improve the model as well 
as
any problems you may find. 

I can be reached at 31631.

Thanks, 
Amitava

EnronCredit.com is working on 3 main models --- the FMC model, the Placement 
model, and the Movement model.
FMC Model : provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33 
industry offsets.  Each day, this model takes the previous day's trader 
curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed 
swap prices.
Placement Model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using 
dummified ranges for Market Capitalization, Liquidity, KMV Score, etc.  One 
main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade 
names.  Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for 
separate sunsets of names.
Movement Model : provides an alert system for news.  This is under 
development.

Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the 
development/modifications of the Placement Model, especially in thinking 
through the various single vs multi model approaches.  We can help in the 
brainstorming for better models for subsets.  One main project right now is 
to get a separate model for subsidiaries, and to exclude subsidiary names 
from the main regression.

Value-at-risk is based on historical variance-covariance approach.

The portfolio model is under development.

Agenda for Houston Research Group members : 

Once sufficient data is collected, start reviewing for potential analytic 
relationships.
Get weekly updates from London, and provide feedback.
Plan on a trip if the work warrants it, once the agenda is fairly well drawn 
out, and data is available for analysis.

Greg,

As a follow up. We are talking to Jay Webb today about the data we can get 
from
the Enron OnLine system to develop an early warning system  for automated 
crude trading.

By the way, it was a good catch. You left us red faced.

Jeff and John,

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

I shall arrange the meeting and get RAC involved.
Would you like to meet them for a short courtesy meeting 
(5 - 10  minutes)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

Vince

Zimin,

I have talked to Alex about it. I don't think that the additional seminars 
will
crowd out the brown bag lunches.

The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and
have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets.

For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake. Brown bag 
lunches
are not that time intensive, except for the speaker.

Plus, we ran out of days  available for lunch meetings.

Vince,
This is a brief summary of last year's Friday Brown Bag Lunch Option Pricing 
series.
We had about 15 lectures, given by the following people:
Grant, Stinston, Vasant, Krishna, Zimin, Maureen, Clayton, Paulo, Chonawee,  
myself, and
some outside speakers. We were able to attract some outside audience as well. 
Overall the response is quite encouraging and we have planned
to continue it. 

In light of the presently scheduled seminars on "Energy Derivatives", it 
seems our Friday
schedule will be too crowded if we have seminars on "Energy Derivatives" on 
two Fridays
and FBBLOP on other Fridays. What's your suggestion? Should we discontinue
the FBBLOP ?

We also have scheduled January 19 for Tom Halliburton's visitor Leon Lasdon 
from UT Austin
to talk on non-linear programming. Should we cancel it?

Best,
Zimin & Alex

Rick,

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for 
banks
(you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan
to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.

Vince

Osman,

Kevin Kindall is working on the 
methods for operational risk.

Please, schedule a meeting with him and  Tanya
(myself included).

Vince

Osman Sezgen@EES

Vince,

I am sorry that I had to miss the staff meeting today.

I am working on the PremiumPower issues--trying to set up a 
meeting with Global Markets. I read their Business Plan and 
will talk to Vasant to update him on the types of products they are
developing.

Another set of issues is related to including business risk (non-market risk)
into the VAR calculations. Several groups here need such
methodologies. Can we set up a brainstorming session when your 
schedule permits? 

Happy New Year,
Osman

Dear Mr. Nur Azmin Abu Bakar,

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions
culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief
investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become
a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor.
Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as
well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves
in May, has yet to be named.

The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial
firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously
underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said
liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods
determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind
positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than
standard VAR.

In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk
have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage
that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take
advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated
in the Basle II capital accord proposals.

Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial
institutions is _151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30%
of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest
figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan

On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is
likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to
the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank
invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

John,

I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts. I could not
agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional
contribution.

Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting 
power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from
power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.

Vince

Thanks a lot.

Stinson,

Thanks a lot for so much work you have done for the simulation model.
It seems that our work will make an impact on EOL trading, that is very
exciting.

Could you e-mail me the spreadsheet model so that I can catch up with
the changes you have made ?   

I read a few books during this vocation. Especially a stochastic processes
book, I finished the entire book.  The queueing theory is very fascinating,
 and hopefully we can apply the theory to a real EBS project.

I will take my family out to see the Nature Bridge Caverns near San Antonio
tomorrow.

See you on Tuesday. 

Happy New Year !

I think it's a growing problem of junk mail

Sometimes it comes from legitimate institutions,
sometimes it represents scams. I got a message today

12/28/00
The markets finally took a breather, as the light volume seemed to indicate
the tax loss season was mostly over, and investors were enjoying their
holidays and trying to forget a bad year for the markets. The week was
pretty god, with perhaps some last minute tax selling on Friday. It will be
interesting to see how next week fares.

I think tech will continue to suffer through the first half of the year. The
earnings are not likely to improve until sometime in the second half. At
that point, year to year comparisons will be more favorable. There will be
some successes, as so many have been beaten down too far. Energy looks
strong right now, but I would be cautious as we get past the winter and the
gas price comes down to a more reasonable level.

Merrill Lynch now predicts fed cuts of 100 basis points by the end of the
summer. These cuts will create a strong emotional push to the market, even
in the face of lower earnings. Merrill Lynch is also predicting a GDP growth
of 2.9%, down from the previous forecast of 3.3%. This certainly would
qualify as a "rough" if not "hard" landing. They expect the GDP growth in
the second half of 2001 to rise at a 3.5%-4% rate. They predict the
strongest earnings to come from Health and Energy at about 14%, with Tech
and Utilities at 10%.

Some of the market weakness and economy concern could stem from the
statements being made by the new Bush administration. They want to be sure
the public is aware of the slowing economy, so the issue will be seen as one
they inherited, not created. They don't want to be seen as the ones who
messed up the great boom. They also want justification for the tax cut plan
they had proposed, and a weaker economy is certainly a good reason to
stimulate the economy with cuts.

There are a number of tax law changes for 2001. The new capital gains rates
for investments held over five years begins- the new rates are 8% and 18%
versus 10% & 20%. The deductible interest on student loans rises from $2000
to $2500. The rate for auto business miles is rising from 32.5 cents/mile to
34.5. The expense deduction for business equipment in the first year rises
from $20k to $24k. The exemption on unearned in come for children has been
raised to $750, from $700. The second $750 in income is taxed at the child's
rate, up from $700. So now there is $1500 of preferential taxation for kids
under 14, up from $1400. For kids 14 and older, they now have $750 tax-free.
On the negative side, social security taxes will be assessed on the first
$80,400 of income, up from $76,200 this year.

REQUEST FOR AN ASSISTANCE

Dear Sir,

With due respect and knowledge of your good reputation, I decided to contact
you for this matter that need urgent attention.  I am COL. DAGOGO KALU.  I
was the commandant of the West African Peace keeping Force & Monitoring
Group (ECOMOG) until I sustained a very serious injury that put me off the
military camp for about 3 months now.  Honestly, I have full trust for your
honesty hence I write this letter to you.

During our recent mission to Sierra Leone, a diamond rich West African
country to cushion the war between the rebels and the ruling Government, we
ran into 2 boxes (consignment) right inside a thick jungle where we believed
was a hide out of the rebels.  As we opened the boxes, one that is smaller
contains numerous sizes of raw diamond.  The Bigger box contains about US
$15.2 Million, which we believed to be the total amount of diamond sold at
that period of time by the rebels before we invaded the place.

Myself and my two other colleagues took the boxes away.  I took the bigger
box containing the US $15.2 million to Cotonou Benin Republic which is the
nearby country and deposited it with one Security Company for safe keeping
to enable me think wisely on what to do with the money.  The smaller box
containing the raw diamond I gave it to my other 2 colleagues, which they
accepted in good faith.

A month after this, the rebels lunched a counter-attack on us where I
sustained a very serious gun shut wound on my right leg.  A lot of our boys
died but few survived.  At this moment, I am receiving medical treatment
here in London.  This is why I need your help urgently.

I need a Foreign Company I will present as the Beneficiary of the huge
amount and also pay in the money into their account.  Your Bank account must
be a good one where we shall not pay much as tax.  You shall also serve as
the general overseer and guardian of this fund and all the investment of
this money will be under your care until I recover fully.

I will give you all the details of the transaction immediately I get your
response.  You will also get a suitable percentage (%) as your share.  All
the documents of the DEPOSIT OF THE MONEY are intact with my wife.  I have
already finalized this arrangement with the Security Company so there is no
problem at all.

Please you can reach me through my Direct Tel/Fax No: 448453342783 where I
am receiving treatment.  In your reply, state clearly your direct telephone
and fax numbers for easy communication and more confidentiality.

Further details will be given to you once I hear from you.
I await your urgent response soonest.
Best regards,
COL. DAGOGO KALU

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions
culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief
investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become
a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor.
Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as
well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves
in May, has yet to be named.

The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial
firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously
underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said
liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods
determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind
positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than
standard VAR.

In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk
have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage
that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take
advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated
in the Basle II capital accord proposals.

Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial
institutions is _151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30%
of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest
figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan

On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is
likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to
the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank
invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

Sheila,

I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago. I want to ask you 
for advice how to handle this case.

My first  reaction was to ignore it. The longer I think about it, the more 
convinced I become that some action 
is required.

Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a 
female employee
was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months 
later about
the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar 
cases, courts  subsequently 
found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such 
complaints.

The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is 
immaterial. 
If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double 
standard in
handling sexual harassment cases.

My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and 
sexual harassment prevention class.

Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.

Vince

Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my "father" 
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind 
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high 
standards you set for all of us in your extended "Group."

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to 
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I "took one for the team," Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

Clayton

sexual harassment prevention class.

Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.

Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my "father" 
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind 
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high 
standards you set for all of us in your extended "Group."

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to 
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I "took one for the team," Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

Clayton

Eugene,

No problem. Please, contact Stinson Gibner or Zimin Lu.

Hi, Vince:

My name is Eugene Zeitz, and I work for EES Gas Desk. We have some questions 
concerning hedging of options. Usually, we address such questions to Krishna, 
but he is out until Jan 21, and we need some help. 

Would it be possible for you to give us 1 hour of your time, or, perhaps, you 
could recommend someone?

           Thanks.

             Eugene.

Dear Vince,

Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working 
there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? 

Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening 
of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for 
John Martin's "new economy" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel 
accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my 
secretary arrange accommodations for you.

Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to 
arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk 
management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this 
spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 
3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have 
you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend 
either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 
1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or 
spring break: 

Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1
Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break)
Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate 
methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of 
Massachusetts
Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2

Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to 
schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be 
scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically 
possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from 
Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from 
Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 
a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Thanks again,

Jim

Jim,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling
extensively
and was overwhelmed with many different projects.

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two
days in a row).

I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student,

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance
& Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you
as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate  and
graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have
in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring
to my LSU classes.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to
seeing you once again.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Here is a short note on potential research with Wharton.  Please review and 
edit and then we can send some indication to the Wharton guys.    ----------

 The objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take, 
and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise 
chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure.  In 
particular, one can view Enron as a hierarchy of companies, and assuming we 
can separately quantify the risks of each unit, what framework would one use 
to analyze risk at Enron? 
  A related question is how one should represent risks in the different 
units?  Risks may be of different types --- short-term volatility risk, 
catastrophic risk, liquidity risk, etc --- what should one focus on for a 
first cut?
 Another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance 
both at the unit level and the enterprise level, and relate the decision to 
get insurance to the cost/benefit of insurance.

Les,

The same to you. Best Holidays Wishes and a Happy New Year.
Hope to see you in Houston in March. I signed up for one training class
and I am sending 2 guys to both courses.

Vince

Seasonal greetings and best wishes for a happy and prosperous new year!

Hello Vince
Happy Holidays.
I wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of Enron Joining
PSERC. As you might have heard from Lance and Alex we are going through a
transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry
members within the last year. Consequently, our business processes are not
well developed. One of the problems we are facing is the balance between the
electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested
in market related research. I hope to recruit more of the later so tat we
have more of a constituency in the Advisory Board  that sees the value of
market related research. I already have a verbal commitment from people at
Electrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC. With members like
Electrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projects
such as the one that Shijie Deng proposed (not funded in this round). Please
let me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron. I am
going to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing and
could come through Huston for a visit. Attached are some items that I shared
with our PSERC members and thought that you might be interested in them as
well.
Regards, Shmuel.

Vince,

I am in Houston (rrived Satruday), and will be in office on Monday (though 
officially, I am on vacation).  Would like to catch up with you if possible.

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC 
side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade.

I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position 
and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later 
with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same 
time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with 
the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

Look forward to touching base with you.

Regards,

Nick,

Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays
and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford.
I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Let's
plan to meet for dinner then.

I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research  
project.
We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project
and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it.
It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection
of the research topics.

We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns.
Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall 
welcome him with open arms.

I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the 
arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.

Hello Vince and Stinson,

First of all,

BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together
some time to have dinner.

I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!

We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the 
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research.

Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter,
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of 
course
you could visit us before that too.

With my WARMEST WISHES,

Nick

Valery,

I am interested in receiving the preprint.
On another note, I would be glad to meet you for lunch/dinner
sometimes during the next few weeks.

Please, let me know what would be the best time to meet.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis
the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in
power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this
regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the
Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for
Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of
forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be
interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be
interested in receiving this preprint.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

Valery Kholodnyi
Manager of Quantitative Analysis
Research and Analytics Group
TXU Energy Trading

PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for
spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:

1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes 
and
Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00, 
July
2000.
2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000.
3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000.
4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at 
Two
Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint
TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000.
5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.

As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard
approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a
stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of
spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian
process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is
Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit
valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that
the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the
absence of spikes.

Jim,

I am attaching below a small draft note prepared by Anshuman on LNG hedging.

It talks of two products: 
(1) Volumetric Options (where we buy a call on 100% of the volumes and sell a 
put on 50% of the volumes to finance the call), and
(2)  Ratio Derivative where we buy two calls at a higher price, and sell one 
at a lower price to finance it.  This is not one that the traders agree to, 
since at the upper price, the calls bought are just at the money, while the 
sold call is in the money, and will cost the seller.

Hence, only Option 1 is useful.  It could provide risk mitigation in the high 
price scenario, while allowing some participation in low prices.  To test it, 
we used March 2001 period.  To have it cost neutral, we would buy a call at 
$26, and sell the put at $25.15.  

As we bounce these ideas, I think it is very important that we work closely 
with the Global Markets group.  The team on the ground knows the contracts 
better, and maybe able to give you insights on what can be sold to MSEB.

Would love to discuss the same with you.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Mike,

Please, schedule an interview with this guy.

Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my "father" 
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind 
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high 
standards you set for all of us in your extended "Group."

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to 
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I "took one for the team," Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

Vincent,
Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like
quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has
done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

Dilbert Newsletter 32.0
   Highlights:
DNRC Update
The DNRC is 300,000 people strong, which is ironic if you consider
that few of us can lift heavy objects.  Luckily we have the
non-DNRC people, the so-called In-duh-viduals, to do our manual
labor.  After Dogbert conquers the planet and makes the
Induhviduals our personal servants, there will be no more fussing
with parallel parking.  A small team of Induhviduals will be
stationed at every potential parking place, ready to lift your
vehicle and gently place it near the curb.  A second team will
swoop in and tongue-clean your bumper to remove the fingerprints
left by the first team.  A third team will swoop in and take your
vehicle to the landfill so you don't have to drive a car that's
been slobbered on.  I realize this sounds inefficient, but remember
there are over six billion Induhviduals.  It's important to keep
them busy.

Speaking of keeping busy...

My Trip to New York City
I am writing this trip report while in New York City to do some PR
for my new web site feature (The Lazy Entrepreneur at Dilbert.com).
Because I am a famous cartoonist I am staying in a new hotel that
costs $500 per night.  That might impress those of you who live in
huts made entirely of manure.  But if you are familiar with NYC you
are probably blowing coffee out your nose and slapping your donut
flat in a fit of spastic laughter because you know what $500 buys
in the Big Apple.  Herein, I offer my description of the luxurious
NYC hotel experience.

I'm struck by the similarity between my situation and John Gotti's.
We have similar careers: He's a convicted mob boss; I'm a
cartoonist.  But here the similarity ends, because his current
living conditions are far more luxurious.

My room is ever-so-slightly wider than the bed.  If it were
possible to make a room smaller than its bed, I would be in that
room.  I'm sure the hotel has hired a team of physicists to crack
that nut.

The television's remote control doesn't work, but that doesn't
matter because you can reach the TV with your hand from almost any
location in the room.

The "closet" consists of a ten-inch metal pipe that sticks out from
the wall, suitable for hanging upwards of three garments.  Directly
below the metal pipe is a safe for your valuables. This leaves
plenty of space for your clothes, assuming you wear the same pants
size as G.I. Joe.

My heating/cooling system produces an inexplicable noise every five
minutes.  The noise sounds like a combination of a squeaky door
opening and a sword being drawn from its scabbard.  This is exactly
the sort of noise you want to hear when you're trying to sleep in
New York City.

The shower has a playful feature.  The only way you can get to the
shower controls is by reaching around a barrier and placing your
head directly under the showerhead.  There's nothing like a snoot
full of cold water to get your day started.

As you probably know, New York City taxi drivers originate from
many different countries.  They compensate for their incomplete
grasp of English by facing away from the passenger and mumbling.  I
learned to interpret their mumbles by the context.  For example, a
mumble when you get in the car means, "You look handsome today.  To
what destination may I transport you?"  A mumble while slowing down
and looking out a side window means, "This is your destination.
Have a wonderful day.  Thank you so much for the business."  If you
argue that he is driving in the wrong direction he will shrug.  The
shrug means, "Your concern is unwarranted.  I have a secret way of
going to places by driving in the wrong direction."  Using this
system of translation I have mastered over 100 different dialects.

Buying Gifts for Women
Most men are not good at buying gifts for women.  That's why I put

True Tales of Induhviduals
Here are some more True Tales of Induhviduals as reported by
vigilant DNRC members.

True Tale 1
A friend of mine manages a Barnes and Noble store.  One of her high
school part-time workers called in to say she was unable to come to
work.  Her excuse was that she couldn't find her bra.

True Tale 2
A group of employees were eating together before a conference.  The
big boss lambasted everyone at the table for his or her role (or
their home state's role) in screwing up the recent election.  His
rant was complete with colorful, blasphemous, scatological and
anatomically impossible metaphors. All this was done with his mouth
full, and capped by a loud belch.  Then his number two, a Senior
VP, topped him in one stroke, by scratching his (own) back with a
table fork.

It is leadership to inspire the soul.

True Tale 3
Update:  We've recently recorded our 500th quote from my boss...

"I didn't fall off the horse yesterday."

True Tale 4
My new officemate comes into my office with three chairs.  One is
particularly nice.  Apparently it was stolen from the conference
room.  His comment, "I asked the other guy taking a chair and he
didn't care."

True Tale 5
I work with an engineer who makes his own cologne. He has several
scents, the worst of which are lemon cough drops and smoky sweet
patchouli.  Pregnant women and people with sensitive noses are
unable to work with him.  Recently he revealed that he has been
experimenting with pheromones and found that he got "quite a
reaction" from women in bars.  That reaction doesn't seem to
include being attracted to him, because he is single and 40 years
old.

True Tale 6
I recently heard an Induhvidual say, "I'm not a rocket surgeon."

True Tale 7
I'm a professor at a university in Georgia.  This semester, two
students misspelled THEIR OWN NAMES.

Another student could not find his way out of the building. He
thought the doors marked EXIT would set off the fire alarm.

True Tale 8
An Induhvidual in my office labeled her tape dispenser with the
word, "TAPE."

I can think of only two reasons:

1. She wanted to make sure that her tape dispenser was not used for
any unauthorized purposes,

or...

2. She feared she would not recognize the tape dispenser in the
future.

True Tale 9
One day I was sitting by my locker reading a book when my friend
walked up and asked me what I was reading. I told her, and she
said, "Wow! Where did you find that? I've been looking everywhere
for that book!" I asked her if she had looked in the library, to
which she replied that she hadn't.

True Tale 10
We have to wear uniforms in gym class, but in the winter when we go
outside it becomes impractical because of the cold.  Solution:
They make us wear our uniforms UNDER our clothes!

To make matters worse, they ask for random "shorts checks" in which
we must pull our pants down a tad to show that we are following
their rules.

True Tale 11
I used to work at the local government offices. I kept all my
papers in a briefcase.  One day I absentmindedly left it in a
common area.

I went back to where I had left it but it wasn't there.  I
eventually found out that the caretaker had it.  He told me, "I
thought it might be a bomb so I took it to my office."

Good Work If You Can Get It
A true story of a "Wally"...

One of my co-workers on a web site project got the idea that since
porn web sites have the distinction of being the only real
moneymaking web sites, they must have the best design and
implementation.  Therefore, we should research them and incorporate
their design into our web site.  He spent two days on this (at
work) and even told several others about his work.  His final
analysis was inconclusive.

Lazy Entrepreneur
The ideas are pouring in to my new web site feature, The Lazy
Entrepreneur, at Dilbert.com.  Here are some of my favorites, some
practical, some whimsical.

Toothbrush Contraceptive Pill Dispenser
Submitted by mattrogers

My girlfriend regularly forgets to take her contraceptive pill.
However, to my knowledge she has never forgotten to brush her teeth
in the morning.

Will someone please invent a toothbrush that has a contraceptive
pill dispenser in the handle?

Video Tombstones
-- Submitted by CaptainBasil

How about a DVD-based, flat screen LCD video unit embedded in a
granite tombstone, for perpetual replay of highlights of the dearly
departed's life?

[Editor's Note: Even better, how about a motion detector so your
video can pop up whenever anyone approaches.  Then add some speech
recognition and some canned replies and you can carry on simple
conversations with the dead.  Example:  You ask, "How are you
today?"  The DVD plays the answer, "Not so good.  Still dead."]

Perpetual Blanket
-- Submitted by Trouble

It's a blanket that wraps down one side of the bed, under the bed
and up the other side of the bed, returning to the top. This way
people who have spouses that constantly steal the covers can always
have a fresh supply being drawn up from beneath.

Optional feature: Alarm when blanket is pulled to PROVE that spouse
steals the covers.

Cubicle Buzzard
-- Submitted by buzzardbert

A stuffed buzzard that can clamp onto the top of an office cubicle
wall, staring at the soon-to-be fired/retired occupant.

Whiteboard Eraser Caps
-- Submitted by TelekineticFool

Dry Erase markers for white boards should have little erasers on
one end, like pencils do, for erasing the occasional small mistake.
That way you don't need to use your fingers or necktie.

Pearls Before Swine
Check out a great new comic strip called "Pearls Before
Swine," by Stephan Pastis.  I love it, and I'm hard to please,
comic-wise. You can find it on the web by using the comics menu in
the top left corner of Dilbert.com, or by going directly to the URL
above.  Read the whole archived month to get the rhythm of it and
to get past the shocking realization that it's mostly about a rat
and a pig talking to each other.

In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to

Dear Mr. Adams,

I had never really read your comic strips until I was forced to do
it for a Business Principles class.  You bash the workplace,
employees and employers.  You make them out to be bad and stupid
people.  That is nothing like what is really going on today in the
workforce.  You really need to think about what you are doing.

Dear Jedi fur,

I wish you had given this information to Mr. Adams sooner.  He
wasted the past eleven years of his life creating inappropriate
cartoons.  He is SO-O-O-O embarrassed now.

However, Mr. Adams is still confused about the process by which
arrogant little pissant students like you become brilliant, helpful
and kind as soon as you join the workforce.  Perhaps you could
clarify that in a future correspondence.

        Sincerely,

        Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

I have your 2000 Desk Calendar and I just wanted to make a minor
complaint.  I am looking at today's December 8th comic and it is
not funny at all.  Perhaps you could have others read it before you
send it off to the printers.

         Tod

Dear Toad,

Obviously you are not a student of history.  December 8th is the
official "Day After Pearl Harbor Day" and as such is often referred
to as "A day that shall live in unfunny."

        Sincerely,

        Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

Your cartoons with the hand coming out of the guy's head are some
of your worst ever.  You have sunk to a new level of stupidity.

         Phil

Dear Phlegm,

Mr. Adams wanted to respond to your insightful letter by drawing a
little picture of that character making an obscene gesture to you
with the hand that's growing out of his head.  He thought this
would be, to use his words, "a hoot."

Fortunately for us all, I have too much class to allow that image
to enter anyone's mind.

        Sincerely,

        Dogbert

John,

In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For "no 
roll" and "roll same position" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to 
outperform slightly more often.

Let me know if you would like to 
1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or
2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for 
rolling/liquidating positions.

Vincent,
Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like
quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has
done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care who
they infect near the end of the semester, they just want to get done!

Here is my available schedule for next year.  I am now overloaded next week
with tasks to complete the semester.  I do hope that we can reschedule
during the first quarter next year.

I would note that my schedule is most free for Thursday or Friday.  I could
fly out late Wednesday night.

Cordially,

The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.  
Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization 
that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group 
comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from 
Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job 
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The 
greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.  
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were 
moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve 
an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would 
stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our 
success.

 Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

Thanks,

I shall attend.

I am in Houston (rrived Satruday), and will be in office on Monday (though 
officially, I am on vacation).  Would like to catch up with you if possible.

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC 
side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade.

I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position 
and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later 
with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same 
time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with 
the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

Look forward to touching base with you.

John,

The updated model does not give answers too different from the earlier 
version.   The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls 
and correcting some of the roll dates.

The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 
bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 
5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition 
is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the 
position limit.

1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a 
trend, but
2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the 
extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back 
when the market reverses.

In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 
5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses 
vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.

--Stinson

Vince,

I appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the
last.  However, my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon
and I wasn't sure I would get back to this before leaving tomorrow.  The
only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro
plus the addition of "Unused information" at the end of the document.  The
unused stuff is made up of notes I made from Hamel, some news stories,
press releases, and random thoughts.  We probably won't use any of this
stuff but I wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful.

The challenge we face at this stage (and where I can most use your help) is
in documenting Enron's risk management functions in a meaningful way.  This
may be best done through examples or in some other way.  I think that our
audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed
examples (even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don't
interrupt the flow of the article.  If you'll make a pass at what you feel
is appropriate I'll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what
you are doing myself.

Vince, I really am enjoying this learning experience.  You guys make a
wonderful "lab".

Sally and I are driving to Louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then
driving to New Orleans and back to Waco by Saturday.  However, I will check
in my e-mail regularly.

Your friend,

John

Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:

The following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred 
Friday, December 15
  1.  Energy Secretary Richardson issuance of an emergency order.
      (Richardson's statement and FPA Section 202(c) order is posted on DOE's 
Web site at:
       http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases00/decpr/pr00309.html )

  2.  FERC's 12/15/00 final order to fix California wholesale markets
       (FERC's Order can be viewed at 
http://www.eei.org/issues/news/cal1215order.pdf)

                                  California Supplies Ordered by Richardson

o Richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to California ISO
o Order is effective as soon as ISO certifies shortage, but ends 12/21/00, 
unless extended
o Prices to be agreed to by supplier and ISO, or FERC will set rate later
o FPA emergency power authority transferred to DOE in 1977

As he said he would on December 13, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson found "an emergency exists in California by reason of the shortage 
of electric energy" and issued an emergency order under section 202 (c) of 
the Federal Power Act (FPA) requiring listed generators and marketers to 
provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the 
California ISO.  In a statement, Richardson said the threat to the 
reliability of the California grid requires a long-term solution, but that in 
the short-term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts.

The 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the ISO certifies to DOE that it 
has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing 
requested service to the ISO.  The ISO must inform each supplier subject to 
the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9:00 PM, 
Eastern Standard Time, the day before the services are needed.  The order 
directs the ISO to allocate, to the extent feasible, requested services among 
subject entities in proportion to each supplier's available excess power.  
The order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3:00 AM, Eastern 
Time, December 21, 2000, unless extended.  To continue to obtain supplies 
under this emergency authority, the ISO must re-certify the shortage to DOE 
headquarters every 24 hours.

The terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers 
to the ISO "are to be agreed to by the parties."  If no agreement is reached, 
then under the FPA's emergency authority Secretary Richardson "will 
immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a determination at a later date 
by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures, and will 
prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and 
reasonable."  The authority of FERC to set rates for power supplied under 
emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do 
not agree to a rate is explicitly included in FPA Section 202(c).  The DOE 
Organization Act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section 
from FERC to DOE.

The 76 entities identified in the order's attachment are all the entities 
that have provided power to the ISO over the last 30 days.  Those entities 
are ordered "to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange, and 
transmit electric energy when, as, and in such amounts as may be requested by 
the" ISO, "acting as agent for and on behalf of Scheduling Coordinators."

Electric Power Daily, December 15, 2000]

             FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural 
Reforms
                  A summary of the December 15 Order and Commission Discussion

At its special meeting today, FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited 
final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting the major 
outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to California the 
responsibility for addressing state-related matters, as discussed below.  At 
the same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as 
well as the imposition of region-wide price caps.

FERC reiterated the November 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances, 
California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates 
due to California's "seriously flawed" market structure and rules in 
conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West.

While all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus-based outcome 
that appropriately balanced all competing interests, each commissioner 
expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order.  Chairman 
Hoecker and Comm. Breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement, while Comms. 
Hebert and Massey laid out their positions where they believed the Commission 
had either "over-reached" or not gone far enough, just as they did on 
November 1, as discussed below.

Highlights of key actions:

(1) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, 
the state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities 
buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to 
purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative 
mechanisms to manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules 
effective at the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman 
Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California 
wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning 
ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public 
Utilities Commission (CPUC).

(2) FERC modified the effective period of the November 1 $150/MWh "soft cap" 
proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a 
"comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which 
incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures" must be 
in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early next 
year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can 
be place by the May 1, deadline.

In a major modification, FERC revised the refund conditions to clarify that 
while certain refund conditions will continue to apply, unless FERC issues 
written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under 
review, refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days.

As proposed, however, supply bids in excess of $150 will be prohibited from 
setting the market-clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above 
$150/MWh will be required to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, 
weekly basis and provide certain cost support.

(3) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require the establishment of 
independent, non-stakeholder governing board for the ISO.  The ISO Governing 
Board must relinquish their decision-making power and operating control to 
the ISO management on January 29, 2001.  A future order will set procedures 
for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process.

(4) In a major modification, FERC adopted a $74/MWh "price benchmark" for 
assessing prices of five-year energy supply contracts.  This benchmark will 
be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of 
pricing long-term contracts.

To facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable 
rates, FERC announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market 
participants.

(5) FERC adopted the November 1 proposal to require market participants to 
schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead market and 
instituting a penalty charge for under-scheduling (in excess of five percent 
of hourly load requirements), in order to discourage over-reliance on the 
real-time spot market.

(6) FERC directed the ISO and the three investor-owned utilities to file 
generation interconnection standards.

(7) FERC affirmed the longer-term measures proposed in the November 1 order, 
including submission of a congestion management design proposal by April 2, 
2001.

(8) FERC deferred resolving key issues, including establishing new ISO board 
selection procedures, developing appropriate market monitoring measures and 
negotiating protective orders associated with data collection.

(9) FERC reiterated its November 1 call to California policy makers there to 
resolve state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability 
of day ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand 
responses; (3) siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of 
sufficient reserve requirements.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Hebert reluctantly concurred, calling the final order a "missed 
opportunity" to, among other things, send appropriate signals for new 
generation siting and conservation.  Reiterating his November 1 concerns, 
Hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the Commission 
should and should not have adopted.  While expressing pleasure at the tone of 
the order ("balanced and considerate"), the bid certainly reversal, and the 
role reserved for the state in the selection of the new ISO board, Hebert 
nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order, which 
he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low.  Hebert faulted the Commission 
for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the November 8 order 
approving the CA ISO's emergency $250/MWh "soft cap" proposal.  Hebert ended 
by challenging the CPUC to do what it can to encourage utilities there to 
forward contract, including easing the existing prudence review requirements.

Comm. Breathitt endorsed the Order, reiterating her support for progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that the Order properly 
"walked the line" by taking all of the competing interests into account, 
calling it less than ideal, but a step in the right direction.  She also 
concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will 
be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of 
the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally she mentioned that any price below the 
$74/MWh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable.

Comm. Massey concurred, but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for 
California ratepayers, stating that he felt that market power had been 
exercised, that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers 
had profited too much at the expense of others in the market.  He warned 
that, as he understood the legal precedents, the Federal Courts were poised 
to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on 
to consumers.  On the positive side, he approved of the de-federalization of 
60% of the market and the creation of long term contracts.  However, he 
emphasized that California regulators must now take the responsibility of 
creating more generation and transmission.  In the long term, Comm. Massey 
hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference 
and that the market would have rules more like PJM.

Finally, Comm. Massey articulated what he would have liked to have done 
differently.  He stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not 
enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the 
on-going investigation.  He also disagreed with the $150/MWh breakpoint, 
preferring instead a hard price per generator.  The Commissioner said he 
would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and 
that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the West.  Finally, 
he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds.

Chairman Hoecker began his comments by saying that the Commission was forced 
to act  and act quickly because the stakes are so high.  He feels that it is 
now time for the state regulators and markets to act.  He noted that by 
shrinking the Cal PX, the responsibility is now with the CPUC to fashion the 
long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the 
least amount of damage to the utilities.  In regards to suggestions for a 
regional price cap, the Chairman stated that this would not work due to the 
fact that the Commission has no jurisdiction over Bonneville, WAPA and the 
public power producers and that there is no spot market in the Northwest.  
However, he did urge Secretary Richardson to convene a conference in order to 
address regional issues.  Finally, in conceptually addressing the California 
situation, the Chairman stated that competition or "deregulation" did not 
fail in California, but that there never was competition in California.

Krishna,

It looks  like a long shot. It will take a long time to bring this person 
here.

Ehud,

Best holiday wishes to you and your family. 

I owe you an apology for dropping the ball on the conference

I have approached a number of executives at Enron. Greg Whalley speaks in 
London a day
before. Louise Kitchen, the mother  of EnronOnline will ski (this is the week
of school holidays in England and her family will come here). 

One suggestion I want to make is Rick Causey. I talked to him and he is 
willing to
be a speaker. He is a very senior and important executive of Enron and a UT 
grad.

Any thoughts?

Vince

Vince,

At the conclusion of another year, and prior to my departure tomorrow with
my family for our annual Florida vacation, Best Wishes for the Holiday
Period to you and your family.

Regarding the Spring 2001 Energy Finance Conference Participation, we still
lack that all-important 2/22 Enron energy-related high-level keynote
speaker.  Let me know if you think we should look elsewhere.

Best Regards,
Ehud

INSIDE WASHINGTON  =02=05 FEDERAL AFFAIRS

***FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural Reforms*=
**

At a special meeting Friday afternoon, FERC unanimously approved its eagerl=
y=20
awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting th=
e=20
major outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to=20
California the responsibility for addressing state-related matters.  At the=
=20
same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well=
=20
as the imposition of region-wide price caps.  FERC reiterated their earlier=
=20
conclusions that under certain circumstances, California ratepayers were=20
subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to California's=20
"seriously flawed" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight=20
demand and supply conditions throughout the West.

FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, the=
=20
state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities buy=
=20
and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to purchase=
=20
electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to=
=20
manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules effective at=
=20
the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman James=20
Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California=20
wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning=
=20
ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The agency also modified the effective period of the $150/MWh "soft cap"=20
proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a=20
"comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which=20
incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures" must b=
e=20
in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early nex=
t=20
year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can=
=20
be place by the May 1, deadline.

***Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst=
er=20
California's Supplies***

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained=
=20
power supply situation in California by issuing an order, pursuant to Secti=
on=20
202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to require generators and marketers to mak=
e=20
power available to meet the state's electricity needs.  The emergency=20
directive requires that, if the California independent system operator (ISO=
)=20
certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity, certain=20
suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have=
=20
power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm=
=20
customers. Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power=
=20
exchange (PX) and the ISO over the last 30 days that have firm capacity=20
available would be subject to the order.

Under the order, the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier=20
subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9:00 pm=
=20
EST on the day before the requested service.  The ISO must, to the extent=
=20
feasible, allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each=20
supplier's available power.  The price for the power provided pursuant to t=
he=20
order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier.  If no=
=20
agreement is reached, FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at =
a=20
later date.   The order will remain in effect until 3:00 am EST on December=
=20
21, 2000 unless modified.

***EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants' Mercury Emissions***

EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in a long-awaited announcement, indicated=
=20
last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury=20
emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants.  The agency stated that it=
=20
plans to propose new regulations in December 2003, and hopes to finalize ne=
w=20
rules by December 2004.

In the wake of the decision, EEI called on EPA to make certain that any=20
program to control utilities' mercury emissions be based on the best=20
scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi=
c=20
health.  "EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key=20
scientific and technological issues," said Paul Bailey, EEI Vice President,=
=20
Environmental Affairs.  Given these uncertainties, EEI is disappointed that=
=20
the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health=20
threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science," said Mr. Bail=
ey.

"In the meantime, the electric power industry will continue to work with al=
l=20
stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions=
=20
from power plants may be needed, and how those cuts should be achieved," Mr=
.=20
Bailey concluded.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

 ***Calpine Completes Acquisition of EMI Power Assets***

Calpine Corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of=
=20
power assets from Energy Management, Inc. (EMI).  In the deal, Calpine=20
acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed, combined-cyc=
le=20
power generating facilities located in New England, as well as a joint=20
marketing venture between Calpine and EMI.  Prior to the transaction, Calpi=
ne=20
held a 50 percent net interest in the projects.

"We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and=20
highly efficient power plants.  The Dighton, Tiverton, and Rumford faciliti=
es=20
were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in=
=20
New England," said Calpine Senior Vice President Bob Alff.  "Combined with=
=20
our other announced project in the Northeast, we have created a coordinated=
=20
system of low-cost assets, with excellent geographic diversity, to provide=
=20
power to a very attractive New England market," added Alff.

***Exelon Completes Acquisition of 49.9 Percent of Sithe***

Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies have announced the completion of=20
Exelon's acquisition of 49.9 percent of the stock of Sithe.  The completion=
=20
of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which PECO Energy Company agre=
ed=20
to purchase 49.9 percent of Sithe's assets in North America for $682=20
million.  PECO has since merged with Unicom Corporation to form Exelon=20
Corporation.

Under the terms of the agreement, Exelon has the option to purchase the=20
remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe within two to five years at a price based o=
n=20
prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised.  Exelon=
=20
and Sithe will continue to operate independently, said the companies.

Becky,

The charges to Corp. go to RAC and are based on my projections of expected 
expenses.

The charges are based on the following assumptions (percentages in the 
parenthesis show
amount of time allocated by each person (group)) to RAC:

1. Value-at-Risk Group (VaR)

MD (25%)
VP (60%)
Director (100%)
5 managers (100%)

2. Enterprise wide risk management

Manager (100%)
Associate (100%)

Currently we hired (or will shortly hire)  4 managers for the VaR group. The 
expansion of the VaR
group was planned based on the requests from RAC for more support.

Madam,

 I have a meeting with Corp tomorrow in reference to the intercompany billing 
to Corp.  They are concerned about Research allocation.  I need some back up 
to this billing.  Can you help me?  Can I get it by the end of the day to 
have it reviewed and ready for tomorrow?  Please let me know....  Thanx
Stephen Schwarzbach@ENRON
12/18/2000 08:55 AM
Becky, 
I am discussing these allocations with the appropriate groups within 
Corporate, as they will be the ones accepting/rejecting these charges.  I am 
forwarding this to the appropriate individuals within the Corp. departments 
for their review.  So, do not consider Corp as "in agreement" until you hear 
back from me.  I also reviewed what we are receiving in 2000 and I have a few 
questions relating to both 2000 and 2001:

1. What is ESource?
2. What is ENA Ops Direct?
3. What is ENA OCC Direct?
4. What is ENA CO 021?  Is this Vince Kaminsky's group?  The charges for 2000 
have been about $16k and $20k to the RAC group, so at that rate, I would 
expect 2001 to be no more than $250k-$300k, but the plan amount you sent is 
$1.9MM.  I will need some detail on this.

Thanks,
Steve

Becky Pham@ECT
12/14/2000 05:15 PM
Attached is the 2001 PRELIMINARY inter-company billing.  ENA will be billing 
plan numbers for all departments except for External Legal and External Tax, 
which will be billed base on actual.  A quarterly review will be done to 
determine the variance between plan vs. actual amounts.  If the variance 
amount is material, we will adjust the billing to your Business Unit 
accordingly.  

If you have any questions, call me at 5-7094.  Please review this billing, 
and notify me with any questions by Wednesday, December 20, 2000; otherwise, 
it is assumed that you agree to the intercompany billing from ENA.  

You are the only person in your Business Unit receiving this invoice.  If 
this invoice needs to go to someone else in your business unit,  please 
forward to the correct person and can I be included in the forward e-mail?

Sam,

Are you sure  you cannot make it just for a few minutes?

Vince

   

Hello, Vince!

I was planning to stop by Damian's this evening, but I think I'll go home 
instead.  I've contracted a sneezy cold, and I don't want to spread it around 
anymore than I already have.  

Thank you for putting this together.  I'll have to make the one in January 
for sure!

Sam

Molly,

It  seems that we got only Bill Bradford so far.

Given that almost everybody will be out that week,
we probably should move the interview to the
beginning of January, even if it means higher
costs.

Vince

   

Bill Bradford has returned our call, and is scheduled to see Iris at 11:30 am 
on 12/28.  More info as it becomes available.

Sorry, I have to cancel the lunch meeting today.

Pleas, give a call sometimes today. Maybe we can meet for drinks Friday
afternoon.

I am taking the next week off.

Dzien dobry,

Mam nadzieje, ze nic sie nie zmienilo i jestesmy umowieni na dziesiejszy 
lunch. Proponuje sie spotkac o godzinie 12.00 na parterze obok biurka 
"security ladies" (bo wiem gdzie to jest). Ubrany jestem w czarne spodnie, 
bezowe buty i szara bluze. Nie jestem pewien czy bede mogl przeczytac 
potwierdzenie, bo od 10 do 11.45 przeprowadzam szkolenie.

Juliusz
 

Gilian, 

No, we don't  additional need more data. I understand Stinson Gibner has 
already sent you a reply with
his findings.

Vince

Vince, 

Was the data we provided sufficient to determine whether the Global Markets 
book administrator correctly utilized the spread option model?  Please let me 
know if there are any additional data requirements.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Vince, 

                  Our goal is to validate that the Enron Global Market book 
administrators are accurately using the "spread option model" as developed by 
the Research Group.    To determine this, we would like to provide you with 
the inputs for a particular deal (as provided by a Global Markets book 
administrator) and have you recalculate the deal value.   We will then 
compare your results to the values calculated by Global Markets.

 Two Koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial P/L effect.  I have 
attached the deal data in two forms: (1) the spread option model that Kara 
Boudreau, Book Administrator EGM, provided and (2) an excel spreadsheet that 
isolates the 2 deals.

 If there is anything more that we could provide, please don't hesitate to 
call me at  x30968.

 Thank you so much for all of your help.

Stinson,

The spreadsheet below shows the allocations I made for EBS.
The numbers in magenta show percentage allocations,
Of course, Samir and Samer are gone, ad so is Roman.
The problem is that once I give the percentages to accounting they become 
fixed for one year. 

Steve,

Yes, I read it. I am going to talk about it with Ted Murphy and possibly Rick 
Buy.
As you have correctly pointed out, the model validation issues cannot
be handled  internally by Research. 

The problem is that everybody is swamped right now with
PRCs and end-of-year issues.

I don't think we shall send our  full  VaR model under any circumstances.
We can offer to sell a reduced version based on RiskMetrics.

By the way, our meeting Tuesday will start at 11:00  a.m., Houston time.

Hi Vince

James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in 
EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo office's new system.  I'm a little 
uncomfortable with this since:
1. Sign off of models is something that I've been brought up to consider to 
be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to...
2. London Research is not the "owner" of Exotica, and we don't necessarily 
have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Research's code.  Indeed, 
can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating 
group for a piece of code thinks it's OK, or they wouldn't have written it 
that way.
3. I'm concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients 
without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from 
an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our 
VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!)

I've tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only, 
and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the 
trading floor to support the tools that Research write.

Your advice/guidance would be appreciated.

All the best,
Steve

I called and left a voicemail but I thought for the benefit of the CC's on 
this, my view is that RAC have never been required to sign off on valuation 
methods. The standard models used at Enron, like SPRDOPT and other routines 
in Exotica.xls are written by Research and therefore I have always assumed 
endorsed by Research. Having said that I do believe firmly that all RAC - MRM 
folks should have a deep understanding of the way products are valued and be 
able to assess and challenge a method. 

I am also happy to provide assistance in the process of designing a method 
but I wouldn't want either of us to feel that RAC are in the way of progress 
by being embedded in a project plan. 

In this instance, given the appropriate documentation, I would imagine the 
time taken to assess the EnergyDesk methodology would be very short - what do 
you have that I could look at ?

DP

James New@ECT
12/08/2000 12:38 PM
I would like to try to clear up a few things regarding the proposed 
implementation of EnergyDesk into Oslo. 

I thought that it was a requirement that all valuation engines (and any 
future changes to the valuation code) are required to be signed off by 
research and RAC before they can be used to value the firm's positions. If 
this is true then this is all I am looking to get onto the project plan the 
time estimates you need to complete your review process. If there is no 
requirement for RAC or research to sign off new or changed valuation engines 
then I will trouble you no further.

Thanks James

Stinson,

Can we confirm it?

Mike,

What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.
Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.

Vince

Vince,

Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is 
not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him 
with no trouble at all.

Thanks,
Anne

Brian,

No problem.

Vince, I finally joined a team that only had two members.  It looks like our
paper will only be about 13 to 15 pages.  We were wondering that since our
team is less than half the size of some of the other teams, if you could
possible relax the length requirement?

Thanks,
Brian Nelson

Brian,

The last class + plus a few days (depending on when I have
to submit the grades).

Vince

Please respond to <nelsonb@rice.edu>

Mr. Kaminski,

I had an interview last Thusday in Dallas and could not attend class.  Did
you set a project deadline?

Thanks,
Brian Nelson

This is the list of projects for the members of the "quant" team.
If you are working on different project, please, ignore this message.

Please, develop in a spreadsheet solutions/examples for the following:

1. Black-Scholes formula
2. Black's formula
3. Develop a spreadsheet to simulate price trajectory using:
     a. GBM
     b. GBM + jump (Formula 2.16 in the book, Figure 2.7)
     c. Mean reversion + jump (Formula 2.17, Figure 2.8)
4. Schwartz Single Factor Model (Formula 6.12)
5. Develop models corresponding to the Figures 7.1, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, 7.8

As I am sure you are aware, we are facing significant challenges with the 
Dabhol project.  As I have delved into the project and our problems, I have 
been disturbed by our lack of information/data relative to our position in 
the grid and the overall fundamentals for the region.  I would like to meet 
with you and get your assistance in identifying some resources to try and 
help the India team develop a better understanding of their market and how to 
identify/develop/use the fundamentals.

Thanks.

Dave,

I would like to recommend to you Sandeep Kohli who is likely to approach you 
regarding a
position in your area.

I have  been working with Sandeep for a number of years and I was always 
impressed with his
skills, intelligence and mature, thoughtful approach to solving business 
problems.

He is currently located in India (our DPC unit) and is looking for a 
permanent position with Enron in Houston
for family reasons (his wife is from Houston and has a family here). Of 
course, there are
some  other obvious factors affecting his decision.

Vince

Gran't number:  (281) 381 9987.

This is his cell phone number.

Vince

Frank,

We shall have about 30 people, highly technical (Ph.D.,  M.S. level).
A presentation of 45 minutes would be optimal, assuming you may arrive 
around 11:45 - 12:00.

We shall get the projector for you.

Please, keep all the receipts for refund.

Vince

Excellent, Vince!  Yes, I will be happy to make a presentation.  Do you have a
projector to which I could simply hook up my laptop?  Could we also have an
overhead projector as a backup?  Many thanks, Frank
P.S.  How long is optimal?  How large an audience and what are the
participants' backgrounds?

Dear Vince,

Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working 
there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? 

Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening 
of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for 
John Martin's "new economy" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel 
accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my 
secretary arrange accommodations for you.

Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to 
arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk 
management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this 
spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 
3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have 
you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend 
either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 
1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or 
spring break: 

Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1
Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break)
Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate 
methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of 
Massachusetts
Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2

Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to 
schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be 
scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically 
possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from 
Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from 
Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 
a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Thanks again,

Jim

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance
& Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you
as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate  and
graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have
in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring
to my LSU classes.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to
seeing you once again.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Folks:

I have tentatively set the date for our first round-table discussion for 
Wednesday, 
December 20th at 3:00pm-4:30pm.  The room, EB3268, will be available from 
3:00 to 5:00pm.   If any of you have an issue with the date, please let me 
know by 
day's end.

Professor Don Kouri of the Physics Department of the University of Houston 
will start 
with an informal 30-45 minute presentation (see appended abstract below) of 
his work 
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have.

Professor Kouri, please let me know if you have any requirements for 
audiovisual 
or other equipment.

This excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the 
subject of our meeting:

[...]   topics to
be discussed at a small ``roundtable'' format meeting, are:

1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling'', data
extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital
data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential
operators to digital data, etc.)

2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems.

There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust
for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which
you are interested, I am willing to focus on them. 
[...]"

Yannis Tzamouranis

Yannis Tzamouranis on 12/11/2000 03:56:49 PM
Folks:

I am trying to set up a meeting with professor Don Kouri of the University of 
Houston and I believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion.  
If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for 
yourselves, please let me know.

This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area 
of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and 
attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).

We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the 
seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester 
season for schools).

A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be 
talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about 
the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earth's atmosphere.

Regarding timing of a meeting, I am free from teaching duties now
so I am flexible. I will be in Houston all of December. I look
forward to hearing more from you. With best wishes,

Questions and Answers

What is Herbal V?

Herbal V is a proprietary blend that was specifically
developed as a safe alternative for men who prefer
an all-natural approach to address impotence and boost
sexual performance. This amazing formula first became
popular with Hollywood insiders and the wealthy elite.
They were maximizing their sex lives, long before it
was available to the general public.

How does Herbal V work?

Developed by a team whose goal was to create the perfect
all-natural aphrodisiac. Herbal V is the result of that
remarkable effort. The Herbal V formula contains a precise
blend of cutting edge pro-sexual nutrients from around
the world that provide nutritional support, making it
possible for a man to have a pleasurable sexual experience.

What can Herbal V do for me?

Herbal V helps support male sexual function and
pleasure in a safe and natural manner. Simply put,
it can make your sex life incredible.

Is Herbal V Safe?

One of the great things about Herbal V is that it is
not a drug. It is an incredible herbal dietary supplement
that provides nutritional support for male sexual function
and pleasure. One of the most comforting features of
Herbal V is that you never have to worry about safety.

Herbal V: Safe - Natural - Exciting

Many have speculated that because Herbal V is so
popular with men, it must contain prescription drugs
or chemical components. Herbal V does not contain any
elements or traces of any prescription drug. Herbal V
is made using the world's most technologically advanced
state-of-the-art cold processing equipment to ensure
maximum purity. Herbal V has been independently analyzed
by the nation's premier testing facility to ensure purity,
quality and to end the rumors that, because it is so
popular, it must somehow be chemical. It is not.
Herbal V is natural - just as it says on the label.
Herbal V is simply fantastic!

Herbal V: Ingredients

Yohimbe, saw palmetto, avena sativa, androstenedione,
guarana, taurine, siberian ginseng, tribulus terrestris.
Tribulus Terrestis is certified to enhanced testosterone
levels by increasing Luteinzing hormone (LH) levels.
Androstenedione which is a precursor to testosterone
unlocks bound testosterone and makes it biologically
active again quickly. This means a dramatic surge in
desire. Avena Sativa Stimulates the neurotransmitter
pleasure centers to maximum capacity. This greatly
intensifies pleasure.

Przepraszam, ze sie tak dlugo nie odzywalem, ale musialem znalezc sobie 
mieszkanie, przeprowadzic sie i kupic jakies meble. Czy lunch w przyszlym

Dave,

No problem. I shall do it  this weekend.

Also, I left you a message regarding Grant Masson (a VP in my group
who left and went to work for El Paso 2 months ago).

I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He 
wants to come back 
after 2 months.

My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite 
competent.
I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other 
side
of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. "The 
Return of Grant 
Masson" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth 
opportunities (and that
I am good manager).

Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the
hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just 
re-instate
him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required 
to hire a VP.

Vince, can you provide for me a detailed list of 2000 accomplishments, 
strengths/weaknesses and feedback against the criteria for the 2000 PRC.  

I need that in the next week or so.

Thanks
Delainey

Martin,

Works for me.

Vince

Shirley, Please, put on my schedule.

The five of us will be riding together for the May 2 short course.  Perhaps 
leaving at 9am would be best to give sufficient time for lunch before the 
course.  Would an estimated departure from Enron at that time be suitable to 
everybody?

Howard,

Thanks for the message and the paper. 
We shall hold an internal  follow-up meeting next Monday to
review potential projects on which we could cooperate in
the future.

Vasant and I will contact you to discuss our recommendations
regarding the future research agenda.

Vince

Dear Vince, Jim, George, David and Vasant:

Neil Doherty, Paul Kleindorfer and I very much enjoyed our discussion last 
Wednesday at Wharton  with you on future joint research  with Enron over the 
coming year. In particular, we see the whole area of capital management and 
catastrophic risk as a fruitful area for foint collaboration. I am sharing 
this message with Louis Thomas and Keith Weigelt who direct the FAP MBA 
program in the hopes that we can find a team to work with us on these issues 
next semester.

Attached is a revised version of our paper on "Evaluating Risk Bearing, 
Mitigation and Risk Transfer Using Exceedance Probability Curves: Project 
Update".   We would greatly appreciate you and your colleagues looking at the 
section on "Cat Bonds Covering Multiple Risks" (pp. 15-19) to see whether our 
example and conclusions make sense to you. We look forward to working with 
your team at Enron   regarding ways that we can build on these preliminary 
findings to make cat bonds for weather risks  more attractive.

Best wishes for the holiday.

Dear Vince

Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning a complimentary pass to the
two-day GARP Convention. Unfortunately, it is not GARP's policy to allow
this for a number of reasons: GARP is a not-for-profit organisation, will
much lower delegate fees (and still the same overheads) than other
conference organizers. GARP's mission is to allow an educational forum for
furtherance of financial risk management and an opportunity to allow
networking and contact time between financial risk professionals. However,
in an attempt to remain at ease with my speakers, I would like to offer a
50% discount off the delegate fee for one of you colleagues in Enron. This
will be for the two-day Convention and will include the Gala Awards Evening
on 13th February, which had over three financial and risk professionals at
GARP 2000.

I trust that this is satisfactory. If you would like to take advantage of
this, please fax a completed registration form, along with a brief covering
note referring to this e-mail, and I will ensure that our administration
depart handle the relevant paper work. If you have any questions please do
not hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to your response and to meeting you in New York in February
(and receiving a copy of your presentation in a few days).

Kind regards

Andreas

Andreas,

Am I entitled to bringing one delegate as a guest, free of charge?
Some conferences offer such privileges.

Vince

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker

This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th
February, 2001.

Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP
2000. There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention.
Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a
result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention
earlier this year. The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management
Forum  are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I
will of  course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of
the  event.

Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:

1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and
New York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure
you can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to
be taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required
as soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you
bring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy
disc or a laptop.

2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what
audio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection -
notably PowerPoint).

3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact
me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.

I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.

Kind regards

Andreas

Good morning everyone:

Several of us were talking and in order to help us get into the 
"Holiday Spirit" we thought it would be nice if each of us brought 
an appetizer, dessert, chips, popcorn, etc. or anything you desire, 
next Monday, the 18th.  We will put everything out in one of the 
conference rooms and celebrate ALL DAY!  Never mind about the 
calories - this is a once-a-year thing!  

This is not mandatory - just if you want to and if you remember!

Also, don't forget the "Holiday Party" at Damians on Tuesday night 
5:30 - 7:30 PM.

Have a great day!

Grant,

No problem. Please, give him my E-mail address or the phone number.

Dear Vince:
?
I am in a somewhat delicate position. One of the  people in the group here 
has asked me to introduce him to you.? As an El  Paso vice president, I 
should not have agreed to do this, and frankly, the guy  should not have 
asked.? But he is clearly very unhappy at El Paso, so, as a  human being, I 
felt it was appropriate. Also, because this guy would have  contacted you 
anyway, with or without my introduction, as a professional  courtesy, I would 
like you to benefit from my experience with this  fellow.
?
The guy's name is Joao Neves (Portugese).? I  think he is reasonably bright 
and seems to have a quite deep understanding of  general finance and 
financial mathematics. He is a manager and feels very  frustrated because he 
had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority.  Instead the group's 
M.D. brought in two Price-Waterhouse-Coopers consultants as  V.P's to run the 
structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I  can understand 
his unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it  is in his 
nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people  starting 
with the IT guys (ok, that's perhaps not much an indictment!) all the  way to 
dismissing Broadie & Glasserman's or Eduardo Schwartz' works as  shoddy or 
shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers  fools.? Caveat 
Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to  emphasize that he is a 
bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given  the appropriate 
environment and supervision, might be quite productive.?  But don't take my 
word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.?  Obviously, I would ask 
that you keep these comments in confidence. I have given  you an honest 
assessment -- brutally so.
?
'Nuff said! I have fulfilled my moral obligations  both to Joao and to you.
?
Best Regards,
Grant.

Grant,

I shall be in the office for a few hours today (looks like food poisoning).
I shall try to call you from home. 

I don't see any major problem. I shall call David Oxley and ask how we could 
structure  the rehire so that you are not hosed this year.

Vince

Vince:
?
Having now the benefit of some experience with El  Paso, I conclude that 
Enron would offer more for me in the long term.? If  you have an interest in 
discussing the matter further, please give me a call. I  would appreciate 
your comments.?

Best Regards,
Grant.

Do you want to discuss it with me some other time?

Tanya

Chris,

I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments.

1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation 
equation and
the way it's typically discretized.

2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain 
what CT is (perhaps a footnote).

I am also including a message I sent to Julie today.

a. Paulo Issler
b. Alex Huang

I shall attend the course on weather only.  

2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5,000 AUD for Lacima.
Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2nd installment comes from the budget 
of our 
office in Australia. I shall talk to Paul Quilkey today about it. Please, let 
me know if there is any delay.

3. The book  will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at 
Rice.
Rice Univ bookshop is placing an order.

4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the best
way to place the order?  Can we pay in US dollars?
Best regards.

Hi Vince,

I'm wondering if you got this last week? If you could have a quick look and

Valuing dot-coms after the fall
The Internet roller coaster may rank as the market's most dramatic
upheaval over the past 20 years, but it certainly hasn't been the only
one. Remember biotech? Real estate? Leveraged buyouts? What about Japan
Incorporated? Sooner or later, investment values always revert to a
fundamental level based on cash flows. Get used to it.
http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1015

Mobile portals mobilize for scale
As investors have cooled to new ventures, survival is now at the top of
the agenda for mobile portals. Whether a portal stays alive will depend on
its ability to offer accessibility, awareness, and the right services. The
rest of the struggle---rapid expansion to ensure long-term survival and,
eventually, global dominion---will come down to guts and determination.
http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1022

The innovative organization
The idea that new businesses prosper best when separated from their
corporate parents has now become conventional wisdom. Although new
ventures do need space to develop, strict separation can prevent them from
obtaining invaluable resources and rob their parents of the vitality they
can generate. The solution? A balance of partitioning and integration.

Programmers abroad: A primer on offshore software development
More and more companies are going offshore to develop and maintain their
software. The reason is simple: this approach saves time and money.
Without discipline in managing offshore relationships, however, a company
not only can squander the cost and time savings it had hoped to gain but
also may face late deliveries, escalating costs, mismatches between
expectations and deliverables, and even outright failure.

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the 
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th 
February, 2001.
?
Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000. 
There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate 
bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are 
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. 
The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very 
well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course 
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.
?
Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:
?
1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th 
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a 
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New 
York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can 
appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken 
into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as 
possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your 
presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a 
laptop.
?
2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual 
requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably 
PowerPoint). 
?
3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you 
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my 
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.
?
If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, 
otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.
?
I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas

Norma,

I fully concur. What can we do about it? Can we change the job classificati=
on=20
retroactively?

Vince

Stephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research=20
group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment=
=20
criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as =
a=20
Senior Specialist.

After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly =
an=20
"under hire."  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more =
of=20
a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of=
=20
this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring=20
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "promotion.=
"

At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron=20
designated as "Professional Meteorologist."  In fact, the most recent simil=
ar=20
hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist=
,=20
who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While=
=20
functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job=20
classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional=20
professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the=20
proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This origin=
al=20
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist=20
category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected=
=20
at this time.

Although a "new-hire" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work=20
experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the=20
Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in=20
Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations,=20
needing no further training and only minimal supervision.

Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enro=
n=20
values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed=20
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager=
=20
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather=
=20
briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparatio=
n=20
as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly=
=20
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a=
=20
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through=20
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.

Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  =
He=20
designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research=
=20
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather=
=20
derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and=
=20
liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion=
=20
and major upgrade of this web page.

These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen=01,s reg=
ular=20
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail=
,=20
to assemble and prepare our trader=01,s weather report.  Recently, with the=
=20
advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntaril=
y=20
on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As hi=
s=20
supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I d=
o=20
not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations=20
assistance.

In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was=
=20
Enron=01,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - =
a=20
meteorologist, coupled with Stephen=01,s desire to work for our company in =
spite=20
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professiona=
l=20
title reflecting his chosen career path..  Once hired, Stephen has clearly=
=20
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well-deserving=
=20
of this immediate and retroactive promotion.

Julie,

A few issues.

1. I would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses (in 
Houston):

a. Paulo Issler
b. Alex Huang

I shall attend the course on weather only.  

2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5,000 AUD for Lacima.
Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2nd installment comes from the budget 
of our 
office in Australia. I shall talk to Paul Quilkey today about it. Please, let 
me know if there is any delay.

3. The book  will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at 
Rice.
Rice Univ bookshop is placing an order.

4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the ebst
way to place the order?  Can we pay in US dollars?

Vince

Please find attached information?for our next two courses and  workshops:? 
Energy Derivatives:? Pricing and Risk Management and
Weather Derivatives, which will be conducted in Houston and in London in  Feb 
/ March 2001.? Instructors will be Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris  Strickland.
?
Because the course requires intense interaction, the courses will  be?limited 
to a maximum of 15 people, so early registration is  encouraged.
?
If you require further information, or would like to register for either or  
both?courses, please contact me via this email or our web site,?www.

Jim,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling 
extensively  
and was overwhelmed with many different projects.

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, I 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two 
days in a row).

I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student, 
Shane Green, has joined us
for 12 month and is doing exceptionally well.

Vince

Jim Garven <James_Garven@baylor.edu> on 11/28/2000 05:10:55 PM
Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Vince:
 I would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of 
this year to 2001. I could not use us all of my available vacation this year 
because of the following reasons:

1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron 
India) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects 
that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business 
knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron.

2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I 
now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. 
Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them 
didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in 
recruiting, training and mentoring.

3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a 
business trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I 
could not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an 
extended period of time.

So, in summary, this year has been a long and challenging one, and as a 
result, I could not take vacation for more than a few days. I request you to 
grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year. 

Currently I have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these, I expect to 
have 112 hours unused at the end of this year.

Thank you,
Krishna.

This is very interesting!

States won by Gore: 19  
States won by Bush: 29  

Counties won by Gore: 677  
Counties won by Bush: 2,434  

Pop. of counties won by Gore: 127 million  
Pop. of counties won by Bush: 143 million  

Sq miles of country won by Gore: 580,000  
Sq miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000  

Now Professor Joseph Olson of the Hamline University School of Law in St.  
Paul Minnesota has produced another interesting new statistic. ?Professor  
Olson looked up the crime statistics for all of these counties and came up  
with this:  

Avg Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2  
Avg Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush: 2.1  

Now, what area of this country do you want electing the President of the  
United States, Gore's or Bush's  

Iris,

I have received your E-mail and phone message.
I shall distribute your papers to the other interviewers.

Also, I shall contact you by Thursday regarding a job offer.

Hi again,

     I don't recall if I mentioned that my Harvard Doctoral dissertation
involved another energy problem - the Transient Stability of Electrical
Power Systems.

     Much of the data, model and analysis was done with lots of
collaborative efforts with my advisors at Harvard and MIT and with the
Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto.

Kind regards,

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Thank you for inviting me to the meeting with Wharton.  It was very 
interesting.  Let me know when you want to have the follow-up meeting.

Hi Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you for taking your time to interview me for opportunities at Enron. I
enjoyed talking you and learning more about Enron and its dynamic business
environment. I appreciate your consideration for a challenging and rewarding
position in this industry. Please find the attached copy of my dissertation.
If you have any problem in compiling this file, please let me know.

I respected your insights and perspective on the issues addressed in my
Ph.D. dissertation; including the issues on creative model building, factors
affecting natural gas and elctricity demand and supply, and implementation
of these models to simulate the future and help traders in the decision
making of their day to day business.

I appreciated talking with you. Thank you for considering me. I am
enthusiastic about opportunities at Enron and look forward to hearing from
you.

Sincerely

Dipak Agarwalla

David Warwick <djw@kwi.com> on 04/12/2001 04:04:32 PM

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Can you reserve the room for Tue, Dec 19, 3:30?

Vince-

George just "remembered" the traders' meetings Monday and Wednesday 
afternoons at 3:30. He' s going to email you- I think Tuesday would ensure a 
turnout of traders as well as analysts. We  could easily have 20 people there 
from Power alone, and there's always Gas .... When you decide the time,  can 
you ask Shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30C1?

Clayton

George,

Let's move the meeting to 3:30 on Tuesday,
December 19.

Vince

George Hopley
12/07/2000 05:38 PM
Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by Enron Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

Thanks for taking initiative on the trip so quickly. Let's meet with Jeff

interesting, enthusiastic and intelligent group.  Thank you for your time!

For those interested in the Houston trip on January 18-19th, please let me

(one-month in advance).

Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze for 
your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as Jeff 
is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and one of the 
most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders.  

Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can do for 
any of you.

Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron!

Dear Vince, Christie and Vasant:

Thank you for the presentation to the Enron Tiger Team.  It was most
informative and well received by the students. This is an exciting project
and the students are enthusuastic and anxious to begin.  Many thanks, also,
for hosting the dinner at the Palladium.  It was a wonderful opportunity to
get to know more about the project, as well the Enron representatives and
the students.

Listed below is the contact information with team contacts identified.
I will send you the teams project preferences as soon as I recieve them from
all the students.

It may be a good idea to contact the students before they leave for vacation
(15-22 Dec) to see who is interested in a trip to Houston in January for
planning purposes.  They will return to campus Jan. 16.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist from this end.

Again, thank you for your support of the Wharton School and of the Tiger

John,

It does not sound silly to me.  I don't get that many opportunities to sit 
down
with those guys in a relaxed atmosphere and chat.

I shall read the notes and get back to you. I have just come back from
 Philadelphia and have to catch up  with a few things.

Vince

Vince,

i know that you are in Philadelphia today but wanted to ship you my "first
pass notes" before I leave town in the morning.  Please edit/add to or
delete anything you think is appropriate.  My objective in the notes is
just to get things down on paper before too much time has passed.  When I
place something in  quotes this indicates a direct quote.

I'll give you a call next week when I get back to town.  Thanks again for a
truly memorable experience.  I plan to frame Jeff's Enron model.  It may
sound silly to you guys but we academics really appreciate opportunities
like the one I got on Monday.  What a truly spectacular day.

Take care,

John

p.s. Andy gave me his note care describing the demand for a peaking plant
but I wasn't able to get him to sign it.  I hope I did not offend him by
asking for his signature on that silly graph.  After I left his office it
occured to me that he might think I was making light of him.  Please
explain to him that I was not and will treasure his simple model as
capturing the essence of optionality in a real asset.

Hi,

?

My name is Larry Roberts.? I'm one of the millions of Internet users with a 
sight problem.? The University of Maryland says seven percent of all Users 
have visual disabilities.? Please take a moment to consider the importance of 
making WebPages accessible for all people.

?

There are hundreds of disabilities involving those with sight problems and 
other 'virtual' disabilities.? The good news is disabled Users can easily 
access sites that comply with universal standards.? Unfortunately, the vast 
majority of sites don't bother to make these simple changes to their 
WebPages.?

?

If you are a disabled user we would be honored to help you set up your Web 
Site absolutely free.? If you already have a Web Site and would like some 
help making it accessible to all Internet users, we offer a complete package 
on W3C Compliancy, including a Real Player Video for a small donation.? Once 
your site is accessible we will gladly add your link to our page.? If you 
can't afford to make a donation then write us and we will help you no 
questions asked.??

?

And more good news, Accessible Sites display virtually the same when viewed 
with any Internet browser.? If you have a Web site for your business on the 
web you'll be happy to know that you are compliant with Section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, as it applies to all Federal contractors. This law 
requires the government can only procure through accessible mediums that are 
inclusive.

?

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this e-mail.? If you 
currently don't have a Web site, but know a friend who does could you a take 
a moment and forward them this information.?

?

It's quite simple to make a Universally Accessible Web site, for further

This is not SPAM and I'm not trying to sell you anything.? My goal is to 
provide every Internet user with information on how to make their Web sites 
accessible to people suffering with disabilities.? I'm the founder of a

Please schedule some time with Kevin Moore (34710) to go up to 3240D and 
train Vince Kaminski on the Avistar system. Please show Vince and Kevin the 
basics, and take them the documentation as well.

Kevin has left for the afternoon. Please call him in the morning (Tuesday) to 
schedule a time

Thanks

Andrea,

It's fine with me. Few points:

1. As a courtesy to Maureen Raymond, please, discuss the timing with her.

2. Yana is not a member of the Analyst/Associate pool. THIS IS NOT A ROTATION.
     She was hired directly and   this means that we transfer her
     permanently to your unit.

Vince

Andrea V Reed
12/05/2000 01:14 PM
I spoke to Yana today and understand that you are supportive of Yana rotating 
through our group, EIM Fundamental Analysis.  We are very pleased that Yana 
will be joining us.  Her skill set will be particularly helpful as we build 
the steel business.

I was hoping that Yana could begin working with us mid December.   Does a 
start date in EIM of Dec. 18 work for you?  Please let me know.

Once again, thank you for your support.

Following your eSpeak session, Erin Rice suggested I contact you about 
joining your group.  I have been with EES for almost three years, and during 
that time I have worked on tasks that are similar to what your group does on 
a larger scale.  Specifically, I excel at analytical/quantitative problem 
solving and the development of models and user requirements for application 
development.  My educational background is energy management, and I have 
recently become involved in the financial aspects of transactions.  I have 
attached my resume for your review, and I hope you will call me so we can 
talk in person.

Thank you.

Enron supports employees' involvement in civic organization
and I think you should continue tour involvement with LWF.
It's important that we give  something back  to society.
You don't have to take a day off to attend workshops.

Vince,

I am currently a candidate member of Leadership Fort Worth through August of 
2001.  I don't know if you are familiar with Leadership Houston or any other 
Leadership group, but it is basically a civic organization that provides a 
forum for leaders to learn more about their community and opportunities for 
civic leadership.  For their first year, members are candidates and must 
attend about 1 full-day workshop a month in FW, normally on a Thursday.  
After that, members can transfer to other Leadership cities.  I talked with 
Stinson about the group and he thought I should talk with you about whether 
or not I should stay involved with LFW.  The attached email describes the 
December meeting scheduled for 12/14.  Thanks

John,

We finished the Version 2 of the simulation model which deals with the
open-close trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version.

I added the cummulative P/L as an output.   There are a few apparent trading
strategies from this model:

1) Higher bid/offer spread, more profit
2) More Daily # of trades, more profit
3) Smaller net open positions allowed, more profit

1) and 2) are obvious, but 3) is more interesting.  It means that we are 
better off
if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day.  In a trending 
market,
this makes an intuitive sense, for example, in the case of bull market we are 
short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price
by keeping zero or small net short positions.

I have attached the model with this mail, and I'll  be happy to discuss the 
model
in more details with you.

Zimin

I have no clue. I shall ignore it.

Folks,

 Those of you who have used UNIX are probably familiar with the grep command. 
It's used to extract lines from a set of files that contain a given input 
string, and is very useful. (If you have any questions on how to invoke it, 
ask me.) 

 The grep command is now available in a PC version -- see below.

Joe

Carlos Uribe@ENRON
12/01/2000 11:23 AM
Todd and Joseph,

As discussed earlier, I did recall reading somewhere that grep had been 
ported to Windows. I did some research and was able to find the Windows 
ported version of grep. Attached you will find a compressed file that 
contains the grep binary and source. Please let me know if I can be of any 
further assistance. Thanks.

Even though I cannot pass "official" interviews, I  would like to discuss

be a good fit for your firm.

I know that you?will be soon recruiting on  campus, maybe we could set up an 
"informal meeting". Either give me a call at  home (412-802-6429) or send me 
an email at this address. I would appreciate  though not to appear on 
interview lists.

desks
are looking for people with trading experience.

Molly,

We can pay for the plane ticket.
We have to make sure that we shall extend the same
treatment to other summer interns to avoid
bad feelings.

Vince

We received some correspondence this morning from Jinbaek in which he says he 
plans to start on June 4, 2001.   Since we are trying to offer a package 
comparable to that of an Associate in the Program, I assume we will also pay 
for his plane ticket here???    Just wanted to check before I contacted 
him...., so I'll wait to hear from you.

Thanks,
Molly

I think the gamma will flow into V@R.

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson

tutejszych ustach. Chetnie bym sie spotkal i porozmawial, ale jestem swiadom 
cennosci Panskiego czasu. Czy sa jeszcze jacys inni Polacy (osoby polskiego

Shirley,

No problem.

P.S. I shall   take 3 vacation days  12/27 through 12/29 (Wed through Fri).
This leaves me with two extra vacation days I would like to take off in 
December.
I shall give you the dates later. 

I shall roll remaining 5 vacation  days into 2001.

Van,

It's nice to hear from you. I am sure that you can always come back 
to Enron if you don't like living in New York.

I used to work for Salomon and chances are you will be working in the same 
building in lower Manhattan where I spent 7  years of my life.

I hope you have a great Holiday  Season.

Dear Vince:

I just wanted to get in touch with you, as my last fall semester here
draws to a close and this is something of a transition point for me.  To
update you on my job search, I have been extended an offer for a position
within Enron's Analyst Program.  The offer was very attractive and I had
numerous things to consider in reaching my decision.  Unfortunately, I
will be declining Enron's offer of employment to take a position in the
Investment Banking Division of Salomon Smith Barney in New York.  My
preference at this point is to live outside of Houston, and although my
hope is also to return to Houston in future, New York offers some
exciting options for me now.  I will be starting there in July of this
summer.  I hope that I will have future opportunities to be an advocate
of Enron and look forward to keeping in touch with you and the Research
Group.

Please give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very
happy holiday season!  Also please feel free to contact me at any time.
I can give you my future contact information when I have it.

Thank you and I hope I'll see you again.

Sincerely,
Van

P.S.  Feel free to forward my news onto Mike Roberts if that would
appropriate.  I didn't have his email with me.

Martin,

I can join the car pool.

Vince

If the schedule works, perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course, 
given the number of us going.  Vasant has offered to drive.  Dependiing on 
driving speed and traffic, leaving Houston by 9:30am should give sufficient 
time to make the 1pm class, including some time for lunch.

Please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate 
plans or suggestions.

Thanks,

Stinson and Vince,

I finished the second version of the model which deals with Open to Close 
trading.
The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open 
price which
will affect the P/L.

I also added the output features that John wants to see.

The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has
a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.  (the anomaly I 
discussed 
with Vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further 
examination).

Could you review what I have done before we talk to John again ?

Hi Helyette,

Congratulations on your papers.

The purchase contract is in the last stage of approvals
(it's circulating through different parts of the company
where it has to be signed). I think we should be able to execute
the contract  in the first few days of December.

I shall let you know as soon as our internal process is completed.

Vince
   

GemanIX@aol.com on 11/29/2000 02:26:12 PM
Dear Vince,
I guess time has been flying for you by since our brilliant show
in Paris.In my case,it is the same:I got 3 papers accepted in THE
3 major Journals in Finance(Journal of Business,Journal of Finance
and Journal of Financial Economics).We should write a piece!
Our software seems to be quite satisfactory for the oil people.My
lawyer had added a paragraph to Karla's document:since she had
mentioned the right for Enron to check at any time the code source
etc,he wanted to request Enron to pay his fees in the case D-G
disappeared.In any case,if you are still interested,we are ready to
use your escrow account to make things simpler.Moreover,I am
striking an agreement with a software company ,13years with
people from Polytechnique+finance,to be our hot line(with us paying
royalties,of course).This would complement my 2 associates.
Looking forward to hearing from you
Helyette

Stephanie,

Thanks for remembering about me.
Yes, I want to renew.

Vince

Dear Vince,

This is to inform you that your subscription to Risk is up for renewal.  The 
regular subscription cost through December, 2001, is $599.00.  The cost after 
the corporate discount is $509.15.

Please let me know if you would like to renew this publication.  We will be 
happy to take care of this for you.  If you have any questions, please do not 
hesitate to call me.

Sincerely,
Stephanie E. Taylor  

Anita,

Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the 
stay.
I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and 
Amitava, based
on the business need.

One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.

Vince

I am making reservations for Iris to leave for London on Monday, April 30,

week.  I can have her return on Friday, April 11, 2001 or Tuesday, May 15, 
2001.   Her only request is that she return before May 17, 2001 when 
Professor Kulatilaka from Boston University is here.    When do you want her 
to return?  

Thanks.  Anita

Donna,

Thanks for the restaurant recommendation. I would appreciate if you could 
coordinate
the dinner with the students and the faculty. You can expect 4 persons from 
Enron but the
restaurant should allow for some flexibility, just in case. If the restaurant 
needs a credit card number
or a security deposit, you can refer them to my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw 
at 713 853 5290.

Enron Tiger Kick-Off meeting scheduled for Wednesday, Dec 6 in Vance Hall
210 from 3:00-5:00pm.

You mentioned possibly wanting to take the group to dinner after the
presentation.  I would like to recommend the Palladium Restaurnat, which is
on Locust Walk here on campus.  You may want to view their website at
www.palladiumrestaurant.com  I think they have a nice menu and can
accomodate large groups.  There are several menus from which to choose, as
well.  Please let me know if you would like for me to set this up for you
and I will notify the students and faculty.

Please let me know if I can assist with your visit in any way.

Regards,
Donna Piazze

My group needs generally people with advanced skills in mathematics and 
programming.
I shall try to help you by forwarding your resume (with your permission) to 
other
units of Enron. Please, let me know if it's OK with you.

Vince

   

Dear Vince,

When we talked last, you mentioned you were considering making additions to 
your office staff.  If you are still considering these additions, I would 
like to talk to you and see if there might be a place for me.  It would be 
wonderful to work with a group such as yours.

It has been great working in recruiting, but the time has come for me to try 
something else.  I am beginning to look around, but wanted to talk to you 
first.  If my skill sets match a position you might be adding, please 
consider me.  I have attached my resume so that you will have an idea of what 
I have done.

Thank you for your consideration.  Have a great Thanksgiving!

I did get the proposal out today, but after close of business your time.
Sorry for the brief delay.  You will find two attachments.  The first is our
time and materials contract, which will need to be executed if you want to
do the test project.  The second is an addendum to that time and materials
contract under Section H, which allows for specific work statements to amend
and supersede the general consulting agreement.  The general consulting
agreement (termsandconditions.doc) contains all the confidentiality, billing
rate, and other provisions that your contract people will probably want and
provides a general framework for doing business.  The work statement
(testproject.doc) contains the specific provisions for our standard weeklong
onsite test project.

I hope we get the opportunity to serve you and ultimately to make
MarketPoint available to you.  In light of the contiguity to the holidays, I
dont think it would be realistic to try to schedule this test project before
then, probably from your perpsective as well as ours.  Let's think about
doing it the first opportunity in January if you decide to go forward if
that is OK with you.

All the best.

Laine,

I can initial it. Please, contact Beth Perlman as an IT officer.
I shall explain the reason we are buying the software to her.

I want the software to reside in our London office - the software is used
primarily by European utilities and we shall use it as a pricing tool
in negotiations with European clients.

Vince, I am circulating the D-G Energy Software License Agreement for

After checking into this issue I have found that the type of information 
requested is proprietary and not available for release.  I will try to 
contact them and see if there is something else we can help them with but as 
far as the data is concerned I don't believe we can help them with that 
request.  I am sorry I couldn't be of more help.  Thank you.

Shalesh,

Please, look into it. Can we give them this information?
I see a remote possibility of a gain for Enron: it's in our interest to 
support
the growth of this market and part of the process is development of the
infrastructure for this market and maintaining public interest.

Vince

Dear Sir:

 The Scientific computation group at the University of
 Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, has recently started to be very
 interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
 market. We find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
 offer challenges from the modelling point
 of view.

 However, we have encountered difficulties when looking for
 data, and we were wondering if you could help us. Specifically
 we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
 existing type of lines ( e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48 .... )

1. What has been the spot lease prices (e.g. $/line-type/mile) for
        the past 12 months?

2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line?

3. What is the maintenance cost $/month ?
           (for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...)

4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?
           (e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade)
                OC3  --> OC12
                OC3  --> OC48
                OC12 --> OC48

5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
        capacity to another (e.g. 1 month, 2 month, ...) ?

 We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Yann d'Halluin

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully
your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Soussan,

Thanks for your message. It would be great to meet you when you come to
Houston.
 I shall be in town on December 7,  flying back from Philly in the morning.
Assuming that the flight is on schedule, I shall be available for dinner.
Please, let me know how I can contact you on Thursday, December the 7th,
to confirm.

Look forward to meeting you.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are
available either evening for dinner.  Would be great to see you again and
catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your
insights, and the risk book you gave me.

I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits
you better.

Vasant,

Thanks. Let's contact Wharton next week.

Vince

Hi Vince,

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Vasant

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential 
project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights 
on the corn price protection approach.

John,

Thanks. Stinson will be able to join us for dinner. He is opting out of
the paper due to his big workload but we can get his perspective on=20
the last 8 years he spent at Enron.

I shall message GARP with this question.

Please, give me a few more days to think about GARP presentation.

I just wanted to follow up and see if I can be your guest at the NY GARP 
meeting.   Also, have you had any time to think of a topic for January.  I

It was Stewart Myers, head of the Financial Engineering Track. He did not 
contact me directly, he contacted Josef (an MIT student that spent the summer 
with Enron and received an offer to come to work with us).

Josef wanted to know who could make the commitment of sponsoring (sending the 
problem).

Claudio.

Who was the professor who came up with the request?

Vince

   
	
	

Vince,

I have received a call from MIT asking if Enron would be interested in 
sponsoring a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar.

This means that Enron would propose a problem that would have its solution 
developed by students in the Financial Engineering Track. These students 
would present the findings in the end. 

I think that Enron has already sponsored a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar. 
I remember something about Real Options at the time I was at school.

Please, let me know if Enron has the interest, specifically the Research. 

Talking here at the Weather Desk, Mark Tawney expressed interest. If you 
agree, we (the Weather Desk) could co-sponsor this Pro-Seminar with the 
Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to Weather 
Trading.

Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.

Thanks,

Claudio

John,

FYI

Vince
Vince:

I will send you our contract for the week long engagement.  The way we do it
is send out our time and materials contract, which has a space for
individual task statements.  I then put in a task statement for the week
long project at the $12K level so that the costs and risks are capped for
you.  Look for it in the next day or two.

With regard to the long run and short run gas models, they are both
implemented in the same software system.  Neither is a prerequisite for
running the other, but both operate the same way and the sum of the two
consumes approximately the same resources are either individually.

I plan to have an extended visit in Houston beginning one week from today
and lasting through the following Wednesday.  (Intensively tutoring my
daughter for her first semester economics finals at Rice.  She certainly
should have gotten a better looking tutor.)  That will make it very easy to
come by and finalize whatever needs to be finalized with you that week.
With her in Houston, I spend a good bit of time there.

Look for the stuff in the next day or two.  I look forward to working with
you and your colleagues.

Thanks
Dale

Dale,

Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you
mentioned
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your
company employees on a case-study.

The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model
internally.

Please, let me know more about this option.

We are primarily interested in a long-term natural gas model and the
database for North America.
Unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite, we don't
have resources to spend too much time on it.

Of course, a trading desk may be interested in the short term
version of the model. I shall talk to them about it.

Vince

John/Vince:

I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.

As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for
MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product, which includes

?    North American gas, short and long term
?    North American electricity, short and long term
?    World gas
?    Western European gas
?    World oil

We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western
European
gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into
MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are
presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business.

As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and
will
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at
the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately 
 the fully
bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the
software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the
electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for 
 the software license plus the data license for a
total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under 
 the fully bundled price.
I
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from
MarketPoint's perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to "scale up" to
another
model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the
gas
decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward.)

I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of
our
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the
same
time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the
benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business.

If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount
MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest
you
begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1 
 day training seminar.
Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 
 day training seminar.
Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks
later.

Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting
that
I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show
anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

Hey Vince,

Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think
it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round
table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially
having been on such a round table discussion.

I've been teaching a "real options" course that has the students performing
monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along
with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your
new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.
However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is
particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option
pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually
figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.

This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented
themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you
and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you
recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?

His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would
preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is
George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a
potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a
particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.

Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too
much.

Molly,

I think you called his bluff. If he does not fax a copy of his paycheck stub,
we should not talk to him. He never talked to me about  it. If he made a true 
statement
about his compensation, he should have no reservations about sending us the 
confirmation.

Vince

   

Vince:  I left you a voicemail about Charles Shen a week or so ago, but 
wanted to follow up with you.  When I called him to extend our offer to him, 
he expressed surprise at the base salary offer of $110,000, and told me that 
he was currently earning base pay in the amount of $120,000.   I told him 
that the salary figure he had written himself on the application was 
$102,000, but he insisted that he had made an error and that it should have 
been $120,000.   I asked him what base salary he was looking for, and he said 
he would expect at least a 10% increase in his base.   I then told him that I 
was not authorized to make an offer above our initial one, and would contact 
you and get back to him.

I called him later that afternoon and asked him to fax me a copy of his last 
paycheck stub so that we could minimize the confusion about his base pay.  He 
said that he would be happy to do so,  but I never received the fax.  He left 
me a voicemail message during the evening that said he was on vacation and 
didn't have access to the pay stubs,  but would send me a copy when he 
returned.

I have not heard from him since, and wondered if he had contacted you.   If 
not, would you want to get together to discuss our next step?

I'll wait to hear from you,
Molly

Good morning Vince,

NEM needs to close above 17.20 to show upside potential. A stronger mining 
play looks like AU.

I want to thank you for going to bat for me as much as I hear that you did.  
Enron was a company where my skills could be very beneficially used. I regret 
that we didn't get to scratch the surface of what I could contribute. I feel 
that beyond being business associates, you and I became good friends. I hope 
that can remain constant through out the future. 

The one true question that I would like to pose to you is this. It appears 
that the political arena here at Enron is currently unfavorable for technical 
analysis. Without fear of hurting my feeling one way or the other, should I 
consider having future opportunities with Enron once, if and when, the 
management situation becomes different?

If nothing ever meshs, that does do stop you from contacting me whenever you 
need Candlestick/technical evaluations.

Your good friend,

Steve

Look forward to meeting you.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are
available either evening for dinner.  Would be great to see you again and
catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your

I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits
you better.

Vince, 

                  Our goal is to validate that the Enron Global Market book 
administrators are accurately using the "spread option model" as developed by 
the Research Group.    To determine this, we would like to provide you with 
the inputs for a particular deal (as provided by a Global Markets book 
administrator) and have you recalculate the deal value.   We will then 
compare your results to the values calculated by Global Markets.

 Two Koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial P/L effect.  I have 
attached the deal data in two forms: (1) the spread option model that Kara 
Boudreau, Book Administrator EGM, provided and (2) an excel spreadsheet that 
isolates the 2 deals.

 If there is anything more that we could provide, please don't hesitate to 
call me at  x30968.

 Thank you so much for all of your help.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

David: 
 On #1, I would say the problem is not with the calculation part, but with 
the market information, or lack thereof (i.e., illiquidity). The gas desk is 
responsible for the supplying prices and volatilities. It is upto them to 
decide how they want to account for illiquidy: change the bid/offer spreads 
accordingly, or add hedging costs, or something else. And on the 
correlations, they do matter but not as much as volatility or price. Since 
these are correlations for the same underlying at the same location across 
time, I think we can make some reasonable assumptions and compute them.

 Regarding #2, I don't agree with the concept of a market top. What the desk 
does with the options is to hedge them. And the way to hedge them is hedge 
teh delta and exercise the options optimally at the same time.

 Finally, I don't think we can use a 2-year swap as a proxy for a 10-year 
swap. Longer term prices and volatilies are driven by the cost of production 
and economic variables and their uncertainities. Those don't necessarily 
reflect the shorter term issues.

Have a great Thanksgiving,
Krishna.

I hope things are well with you and your family.

The reason for contacting you today is to let you know I will be in Houston 
next
week between Monday and Wednesday inclusive.  If there is an opportunity to 
meet
up, probably informally, it would be useful to discuss our continuing 
activities
in the areas of Strategy, Value and, increasingly, Real Options.

If you are attending our Energy Symposium, or can meet up, please contact me 
at
your convenience.  If we do meet, I would also like to introduce you to one of
our senior managers from Houston:  George E. Danner.  George is a member of 
our
US National Strategy team and part of our global network of specialists 
working
on real option pricing.

If I do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy Thanksgiving.

Thanks for forwarding the resume.  We have generally had great success with 
ex-Koch people.
He sounds might like he may be a good fit for Michael L. Miller in principal 
investments.  At this point
I have very recently inherited two other stron VPs from EI and therefore will 
probably focus on a few
Manager and Associates for the near term but I would like to keep James'

He sounds like someone we should at least meet with and figure out a spot 
within Wholesale Services.
What do you think?

We shall prepare for you the electricity price
information (Cinergy, Cobb and Palo Verde) but
you have to approach FT (the publishers of

index we recommend using)  and request the permision
to use the data. We are not allowed to distribute

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Mulong

John,

The outline of a message to Nesbitt.

Dale,

Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you 
mentioned 
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company 
employees on a case-study.

The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the 
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us 
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model 
internally.

Please, let me know more about this option.

One of them was a bit nervous about the formality of turning in an actual
resume...

Please let me know whether the academic info is not enough.

Cheers,

Carlos

Dear Vincent and Stinson,

Both my students would love to come visit you guys for an informal
visit in the near future. Please let me know well ahead of time
when they can come. If possible, see to it that their parking expenses
be paid when they do come.

I'll be in touch with you all over the next months about this and
a possible postdoctoral/trainee agreement (World Lab.).

Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of 
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we 
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which 
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me 
know your decision by November 21.  If you have any questions, call me at 
5-7094.  Thanx.

Please, look into it. Can we give them this information?
I see a remote possibility of a gain for Enron: it's in our interest to

the growth of this market and part of the process is development of the

Dear Sir:

 The Scientific computation group at the University of
 Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, has recently started to be very
 interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
 market. We find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
 offer challenges from the modelling point
 of view.

 However, we have encountered difficulties when looking for
 data, and we were wondering if you could help us. Specifically
 we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
 existing type of lines ( e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48 .... )

1. What has been the spot lease prices (e.g. $/line-type/mile) for
        the past 12 months?

2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line?

3. What is the maintenance cost $/month ?
           (for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...)

4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?
           (e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade)
                OC3  --> OC12
                OC3  --> OC48
                OC12 --> OC48

5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
        capacity to another (e.g. 1 month, 2 month, ...) ?

 We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Yann d'Halluin

Dear?Vincent Kaminski:
?
I got your contact details from the  web site for power marketers. I have a 
strong interest in pursuing a career in  the energy industry?with a top 
energy company like?Enron, where my  abilities and qualifications can be 
fully applied for our mutual benefit.  

I am graduating in May with an  MBA?degree with concentrations in finance and 
information systems. This  summer I worked?as an intern with Structuring and 
Analytics group of Ameren  Energy.?This internship?has been especially  
challenging and has enhanced my professional competencies. While there, I  
was afforded the opportunity to?develop a forward view  model?for?off-
peak?electricity price forecasting and analyze the  data sets of a 
fundamental?model to create forward price curves. Both  projects added value 
to the company and provided me with first-hand experience  in the area of 
energy trading and marketing as well as modeling  techniques.

In addition, I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical  Engineering and 
two years' experience in power generating. With my work  experience in energy 
finance and exceptional academic and professional  achievements, along with 
my exemplary leadership and management potential and  outstanding analytical, 
business communication, problem-solving and computer  skills, I'm convinced 
that I will be able to make immediate contributions to  your company. 

I am attaching my resume for your review. Should you have  any questions or 
need clarification, please feel free to contact me at (504)  861-9110 or 
qchen1@tulane.edu.

As I have some offers with deadlines  approaching, I would appreciate it if 
you could give me a quick response. I also  expect?a base compensation above 
$75k. I look forward to?hearing from  you soon.

I made a mistake and put comments for another person into Krishnar's PRC.  
Please make sure that you ignore it if I can't get it fixed.  Below is what I 
intended to put in.  My apologies.  

I will get my assistant to get it deleted and put this information in on 
monday.  It won't let me do it now.  I guess it does not pay to leave 30 or 
40 reviews to the last day.  Paula: Please fix this for me and let Vince know 
either that it is fixed or cannot be fixed.

Innovation/Entrapraneurship
No Basis

Communicating Goal Setting
No Basis

Team Work / Communication
Excellent.  Very easy to work with and get along with.

Business Instincts
Excellent.  Krishnar is consistent in asking to help out and asking what more 
he could do to help us out.

Analystical Technical
Excellent.  Krishnar has a very strong grasp of what we are doing and how it 
should be done.

Overall
Excellent.  My interactions with Krishnar have been limited but positive.  
Krishnar is always positive with a positive attitude to get the job done.

Strengths:
Very strong analytical skills with a desire to add value.

Areas for Improvements
I don't understand Krisnar's role (is leading all research people on our 
floor or just some) well and have had limited interaction with him.  {all has 
been positive when it has ocurred} This suggests that Krishnar might spend 
more time define what his people are doing and getting feedback about their 
performance, and developing the project scope better.

Shirley,

Please, arrange a phone interview next week. TT,  SG, ZL, VK.

Also, please remember to turn in your grades for all of your graduating

Claudio.

Who was the professor who came up with the request?

Vince

   
	
	

Vince,

I have received a call from MIT asking if Enron would be interested in 
sponsoring a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar.

This means that Enron would propose a problem that would have its solution 
developed by students in the Financial Engineering Track. These students 
would present the findings in the end. 

I think that Enron has already sponsored a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar. 
I remember something about Real Options at the time I was at school.

Please, let me know if Enron has the interest, specifically the Research. 

Talking here at the Weather Desk, Mark Tawney expressed interest. If you 
agree, we (the Weather Desk) could co-sponsor this Pro-Seminar with the 
Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to Weather 
Trading.

Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.

Thanks,

Claudio

Vince,

I am trying to price a crack spread option utilizing either of the following 
models in the Exotica Library:

1. Spread Options by 1-D integration - SPRDOPT

2. Spread Options on Asian Spreads - ASNSPRD

How do I get access to these options models?  Who can I visit with in the 
Houston group if I have any questions regarding the models.  Your help would 
be greatly appreciated.  I am located in Singapore, so I would probably be 
visiting with the Houston personnel via e-mail.

Thanks,

Pat Markey

P.S. - I have access to the O:\research\exotica\xll\xll_templates\ directory; 
however, there are no macros associated with the programs that I can find.  
Also, I don't have access to the M: drive.  Please let me know where to find 
these options models.

                          give notice of the revocation of your independence, 
effective today. Her
                          Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume 
monarchial duties over
                          all states, commonwealths and other territories 
(except Utah, which she
                          does not fancy). Your new prime minister (The rt. 
hon. Tony Blair, MP for
                          the 97.85 percent of you who have until now been 
unaware that there is a
                          world outside your borders) will appoint a minister 
for America without the
                          need for further elections. Congress and the Senate 
will be disbanded. A
                          questionnaire will be circulated next year to 
determine whether any of you
                          noticed. To aid in the transition to a British 
Crown Dependency, the
                          following rules are introduced with immediate 
effect: 

                             1.You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford 
English Dictionary.
                               Then look up "aluminum." Check the 
pronunciation guide. You will
                               be amazed at just how wrongly you have been 
pronouncing it.
                               Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to 
acceptable levels.
                               Look up "vocabulary." Using the same 27 words 
interspersed with
                               filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is 
an unacceptable and
                               inefficient form of communication. Look up 
"interspersed." 

                             2.There is no such thing as "U.S. English." We 
will let Microsoft know
                               on your behalf. 

                             3.You should learn to distinguish the English 
and Australian
                               accents. It really isn't that hard. 

                             4.Hollywood will be required occasionally to 
cast English actors as
                               the good guys. 

                             5.You should relearn your original national 
anthem, "God Save The
                               Queen," but only after fully carrying out task 
1. We would not want
                               you to get confused and give up halfway 
through. 

                             6.You should stop playing American "football." 
There is only one kind
                               of football. What you refer to as American 
"football" is not a very
                               good game. The 2.15 percent of you who are 
aware that there is a
                               world outside your borders may have noticed 
that no one else
                               plays "American" football. You will no longer 
be allowed to play it,
                               and should instead play proper football. 
Initially, it would be best if
                               you played with the girls. It is a difficult 
game. Those of you brave
                               enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby 
(which is similar to
                               American "football," but does not involve 
stopping for a rest every
                               20 seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour 
like nancies). We
                               are hoping to get together at least a U.S. 
rugby sevens side by
                               2005. 
                           
                             7.July 4th is no longer a public holiday. 
November 8th will be a new
                               national holiday, but only in England. It will 
be called "Indecisive
                               Day." 

                             8.All American cars are hereby banned. They are 
crap and it is for
                               your own good. When we show you German cars, 
you will
                               understand what we mean. 

                            9.Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been 
driving us crazy. 

                          Thank you for your cooperation.

John,

Here is the spreadsheet Zimin built for estimaing P/L from trading WTI 
forwards.     Let Zimin, Vince, or I know if you have questions or comments.

Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.

Zimin

David,

I can ask our CEO John Sherriff.
Please, let me know by 10:00 a.m. Central Time, Wednesday.

Vince

David Warwick <djw@kwi.com> on 04/24/2001 05:24:53 PM
Vince

Sorry to hear you cannot make it ... you would obviously have been the big
catch !!

In terms of a London based replacement, who did you have in mind and what
sort of subject could they cover ?

David

David,

I regret to inform you I am unable to attend the conference due to previous
commitments.
Would you consider a speakers form our London office?

Vince

David Warwick <djw@kwi.com> on 04/24/2001 09:47:31 AM

Vince

Any further thoughts on this ?

David

David,

Thanks for the invitation.
I shall check my schedule on Monday and will get back to you
regarding the conference.

I hope you will a very Happy Easter.

Vince

David Warwick <djw@kwi.com> on 04/12/2001 04:04:32 PM

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of 
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we 
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which 
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me 
know your decision by November 21.  If you have any questions, call me at 
5-7094.  Thanx.

Dear Giuseppe:

Unfortunately, I am no longer with the Associate and Analyst recruiting 
department and will be unable to assist you directly.  Please contact Tracy 
Warner, who is now responsible for recruiting.  She will be able to assist 
you directly.  Tracy can be contacted at Tracy.Warner@Enron.com.  I would 
also recommend having Vince Kaminski contact her as well to ensure that all 
communications are in order.

Best regards,

Sent by: gappy@Stanford.EDU
Celeste, my name is Giuseppe A. Paleologo and you amy remember me: I was
a summer intern last summer in the research group, and attended the
hiring event this year at Stanford. In that occasion I had an informal
offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a
written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not
received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is
still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the
process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before
I make my final decision.

Thanks in advance,

Giuseppe Paleologo

Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.

The next step is to incorporate the intra-day market movement by using high 
and low
prices into the pricing.  I will call you on Monday.

Happy Thanksgivings !

Everything the Gore campaign was hoping to hear from Judge Lewis this morning 
they heard from the
Florida Supreme Court this afternoon. Voting 7-0 on its own motion, this very 
activist court of all Democrats
ordered Secretary of State Harris not to certify the vote "until further 
order of the court." This is a massive
victory for Gore (and more than even the Gore forces expected) and completely 
reverses the devastating
body blow dealt by Lewis this morning. A hearing is scheduled for Monday at 2 
pm on the issue of the
manual recounts.

What this means is the counting will go forward on a 24-hour basis in Palm 
Beach and Broward counties.
 This also saps the Bush campaign of much of the positive PR momentum they 
had built up as we
head into the weekend.

The justices set a hearing time Monday to begin hearing arguments for a final 
ruling in the matter, but this
quick ruling on appeal is extremely favorable to Gore and should allow the 
counties time to get real votes
tallied and leaked out to the public. Republican observers in the counties 
have been doing their job and
objecting so strenuously to every possible problem that they have prevented 
Palm Beach from finishing even
one precinct over the past two days. That has kept any numbers from leaking 
to the public as of this writing.
But now the Democrats have until at least Monday to get some numbers out in 
public.

The slow pace of the recount augurs poorly for a final resolution of the 
election.  Dade County, Florida's most populous has just
announced that they will recount over 1 million ballots--which they say could 
take up to a month.

We note that the NASDAQ is off 12 percent since election.  Prolonged 
uncertainty is only bad news for the markets, as the world waits 
for a sense of direction about US leadership on a range of issues from high 
oil prices to the Mid-East peace process to 
economic uncertainties in Argentina and in major currency markets.

from my daughter Kris.....

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++

    I saw this on one of my webgroups. I thought it was interesting, and
thought you might find it so as well.....

Ordinarily I don't post stuff like this here, but I've been asked to do
so for the benefit of those RenGeeks who get all their news from here.

This information comes from my father, who heard it once (and only once)
from the media.  Either from Fox News Channel or from CBS radio.  If
someone can post an official source to back this up, I'd love to see
it.

Anyway, that being said, you may find this of interest:

- Regarding those 19,000 double-punched ballots that Florida is not
  counting, and that the Gore campaign is using to try and call for
  another vote:

  These ballots are (mostly) not the result of confused individuals.  In
  reality, double-punching a ballot is standard procedure for election
  workers to invalidate a ballot that were punched in error.  If you
  punch out the hole for someone, and then change your mind before
  putting the card in the box, and you ask an official for another card,
  the old card (with your mistake) is deliberately double-punched so
  that it shouldn't accidentally be counted.

  In other words, Gore's claim that 19,000 of his supporters are having
  their votes discarded is completely bogus.  Those double-punched cards
  correspond to mistakes that have already been corrected.

  Also of interest - this isn't unusual.  In 1996, Palm Beach had
  approximately 15,000 double-punched ballots.  For the same reason.
  Because people made mistakes and needed new cards.

  While I'm sure some of the double-punches were from clueless voters,
  it is completely wrong when the media says that this is the case for
  all 19,000 of them

  (Souce for the 1996 figure:
http://foxnews.com/election_night/after/confusing_ballots.sml)

- Regarding the "illegal" butterfly ballot that the Gore people want
  invalidated (to call for a re-vote in Palm Beach), they are
  conveniently ignoring some of that law.

  The law in Florida is that a ballot, once designed, is presented to
  both parties for review.  They have 30 days in which to file
  complaints.  If nobody complains before the election, then it can't be
  thrown out afterwards.  Neither the Republican nor the Democratic
  party filed any complaint with the ballot during the 30 day review
  period.

- Regarding the 3400 Buchannan votes that came from Palm Beach.  It's
  actually not as surprising as the media would have you believe.
  During the campaign, Buchannan held a fund-raising dinner in Palm
  Beach.  He was able to get 1000 attendees.  If 1000 people were
  willing to pay money and attend his fund raiser, I would consider 3400
  votes from that same place to be very surprising.

We have said the election is in the hands of the courts; the courts and 
momentum are now swinging toward the Bush camp.

The unequivocal ruling by Leon County circuit Judge Terry Lewis rejecting the 
plea by
Democrats and affirming that Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris did 
indeed
exercise her discretion in rejecting the hand recounts totals represents a 
stunning
setback for Vice President Al Gore. "It appears that the secretary has 
exercised her reasoned
judgment to determine what relevant factors and criteria should be considered 
... my order requires nothing
more," the terse Lewis verdict read. It means the certification of the 
Florida vote is likely to
proceed on Saturday, with Secretary of State Harris certain to declare Bush 
the
winner and give Florida's 25 electoral votes to Bush and thus put him over 
the top
with 271 electoral votes.

This is not formally over as the Democrats are likely to immediately appeal 
the Lewis decision to the Florida
State Supreme Court and other legal challenges are still pending (e.g. the 
Palm Beach butterfly ballot
challenge). But it will be an extremely difficult path from here.

For now Palm Beach and Broward are still recounting, waiting for the Supreme 
Court to tell them to stop
much like they waited to be told to start. If they are told to stop, then it 
is obviously over. The Gore
campaign staff will also have to move quickly to send their appeal to the 
State
Supreme Court. But the Court may not even hear the appeal, for proving Harris 
did not act with
discretion -- already difficult as the Lewis ruling showed -- will become 
even more difficult on appeal. 

The Democrats now have to race against time as their last remaining asset is 
to "leak" a hand recount total that
would have put Gore ahead -- if Harris had accepted them. But as the legal 
options dwindle, and the court of
public opinion becomes even more important, the Lewis ruling and the 
inevitable Harris
certification (barring intercession by Florida's Supreme Court) tomorrow 
provides the
Republicans with a powerful public relations weapon to turn public opinion 
sharply in
favor of calling the race over.

Of course we are still waiting for the approximately 2300 overseas absentee 
ballots to be counted and there
is a small possibility that these may help Gore. However, Bush has won over 
60% of the overseas absentee
ballots received to date.

recollections.  Please edit it to your liking and pass it back to me.  In
the next steps I have laid out a plan of action that should lead us to a
successful conclusion and a draft by Christmas.

Let me emphasize that this is a working document so feel free to modify it
in whatever ways you think appropriate (don't be bashful--I want us to get
this right).

Have a great day.

Your friend,

Hello Charlene,

I am forwarding you a resume of a student from Berkeley. 
We would  like very much to have him as a summer intern with my group.

Please, let me know if your program can accommodate him.

Vince, would you be agreeable to such a phone call, or would you prefer to 
designate someone in your group?
Jim,

Thanks for the feed-back. To assist in the further development of the
product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved
? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main
concern was whether or not CHARM would have the capacity to cover the very
different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would
you mind if someone from our CHARM group called you or Mr. Kaminski for
some specific comments ?

Regards,

Bertil

James.L.Bouillion@enron.com on 04/24/2001 01:35:09 PM

Bertil, I again wish to thank you for the presentation on the CHARM
product.  The response from the group is that the model requires more work
before Enron could consider it as a commercial product.  Please keep me
advised as I assume that you will continue to develop the model.

James L Bouillion
04/11/2001 06:50 AM

No word yet.  I will follow up with the attendees.

Thanks for taking thje time to make the presentation.

Jim,

Any feed-back on our meeting ? We certainly appreciated the opportunity and
the fact that the meeting was very interactive.

Regards,

Bertil

Sam,

Good thinking. I shall also write an article over the weekend so we shall 
have one in reserve.

Vince

   

Good Morning, Vince!

As I will be on vacation (tomorrow until Monday the 27th), I'm enlisting 
Elena Chilkina's help in producing this Monday's (20 Nov.) newsletter.  
Here's how I hope it will work:  

I've asked Alex Huang to try to get his article to you by Friday for your 
review.
I'm attempting to get with Sharad today to get his photo and remind him about 
the bio piece for page one.  He should be the feature for Monday.
I will also schedule a person and an article (probably from Charlie Weldon) 
for the 27th.  If Alex's article is a two-parter, we'll just do part 2 that 
day instead.
For all submissions for this coming Monday's issue, I would ask that they be 
e-mailed to Elena Chilkina

If you notice something I may have missed,  would you please let me know?

Thank You!

Sam

Vince

Jinbaek,

May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.

I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short
notice.

When you come here you can determine in what area he could make
the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail
him independently and talk to him.

Vince

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

We are organizing a group with RAC to send a few people 
to this conference at a discount to full cost.

Hi Vince,

 did not we get a free guest registration for this conference since you were 
speaking?  I ask because I just got an expense approval request from Lance 
for about $2300, which is the registration cost of the conference.  I just 
wanted to check with you first before I approve.

Thanks,

george,

here is the presentation. I wasn't able to add a table showing the 
distribution of bids by fuel type for April 2000 since the database is not 
updated. Also, in the map I didn't make those minor changes. Because when I 
try to erase those names, the map looks ugly. when i get back from california 
let's get together and discuss the feedbacks from traders.

sevil,

Sam,

This is the paper by Sharad.

I shall Stinson  to do some editing.

Vince

Stinson ,Vince ,Zimin,

Here's a brief document on constraints on the shape of a smile for a fixed 
expiry date.
the constraints are neccessary and sufficient for no arbitrage in this case.
I've used a template created by Dr. Leppard which is why it looks so scary. 

If you need constraints in the time direction then I will have to think a 
little bit more about it.
I think constraints in this direction are very model depenendent e.g. 
stochastic volatility and local volatility models
will throw up different constraints.

Steve,
I am not sure if our traders (or quants for that matter) are aware of these 
constraints
and some desks are beginning to build smiles...

Regards
Sharad

Tanya, Naveen,

Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes 
of prices and positions.
This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas 
portfolio. A big jump in
the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price 
movement may produce an
observation that looks artificially big.

If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there 
should be 
no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach
is to separate the price process from the position changes. 

Vince

Tanya Tamarchenko
11/13/2000 08:38 AM
Naveen,
I am trying to answer the question: what is the appropriate stochastic 
process to model the behavior
of commodities' prices in our VAR model. So what  I do care about is the 
behavior of log-returns. 
Any help is appreciated.

Tanya.
 

Naveen Andrews@ENRON
11/10/2000 04:35 PM
Tanya,
               We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an 
extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree 
for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.  

Regards
Naveen

Tanya Tamarchenko@ECT
11/10/2000 04:17 PM
Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

Frank,

I am definitely interested in the resume. I can meet the candidate on campus 
when
I visit my son. I am planning to come to Palo Alto around Thanksgiving.

Also, Energy and Power Risk Management (an English publication)
organizes every year in Houston a POWER RISK conference (typically in May).
They ask me for recommendations regarding
speakers. Would you be interested in participating?

Vince

Vince,

  I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.
If you'd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Amitava,

We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information 
on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would 
be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to 
gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly 
employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the "product" we'll send to 
Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she 
could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that 
might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely 
efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to 
begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.

I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 
Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, 
it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration 
sets with a likely return visit to London as required.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Cheers,
Scott

North American Natural Gas
Conference Call and Web Presentation

A Cambridge Energy Research Associates Conference Call

TOPIC
WINTER WEATHER SCENARIOS: BRACING FOR THE STORM
* Demand potential under cold, normal, and warm weather
conditions this winter. A return to normal weather will
push demand well above last year's levels.
* Storage outlook. How low can it go?
* Price. Limited demand flexibility and low storage
levels will continue to drive prices through the winter.

Eric,

I have one on EGS, one on Dhabol and a recent one on
entrepreneurship  in Enron. You can buy
the case studies from the HBS web-site.

Vince,

What case studies do you have on Enron?

Vince J Kaminski
10/11/2000 16:15
Eric,

I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge.
I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS
site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it. 

When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was 
ready
 and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals.

I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.

I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.

Vince

Eric Gadd

Vince-

Where might I find copies of the case studies Enron has published?  I'm 
particularly interested in the Sutton Bridge publication for Havard but would 
like to know if there is a library of case studies.

Tanya,
               We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an 
extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree 
for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.  

Regards
Naveen

Tanya Tamarchenko@ECT
11/10/2000 04:17 PM
Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

See the spreadsheet is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya

Jens,

I think I have cc'ed  you on this. John Nowlan approved and Stinson Gibner
has the curves available for you.

Vince

Hi Vince,

Have you already heard back from John Nowlan? 

Thanks a lot for your help again. Have a great weekend.

Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM
Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

Olaf Korn

p.s. Bei Rueckfragen stehe ich Ihnen jederzeit gern zur Verfuegung

Hi Vince -

Hope all is well with you.

Sharad hasn't had time to evaluate our Willow Tree or Monte Carlo software
since the middle of last year.  Is there somebody else that could do it?

Please let me know who I should send the evaluation to.

Bryan,

We shall be glad to  take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor 
provided system we
have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will 
have no objections to it.

Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the 
system you want to buy
with the rest of VaR/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this 
endeavor.

An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be 
rolled into the existing risk systems.

Vince

Bryan Seyfried
11/10/2000 03:20 AM
Vince/Steve -- we are going to the Board in December to ask for formal 
limits.  As you know one of the key limits at the Board level is Value at 
Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our 
approach for calculating VaR.  We have implemented a third party risk system 
which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt 
positions in.  The system has a VaR engine which is being demo'd by the 
vendor today.  Ben and Kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the 
technology acceptable, I propose moving forward with implemantion of the 
module.  Pls. let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would 
envision implementing.

thanks

Rick and Ted,

It looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding 
chicken houses.

I shall send a message to Bryan saying that the Research has to look under 
the hood and examine the mechanics
of the model in order to sign off on it. A dog and pony show is not 
sufficient. In any case, the decision to approve
the model should not be left to Ben and Kirstee.

Please, let me know what your thinking is.

george,

here is the presentation. I wasn't able to add a table showing the 
distribution of bids by fuel type for April 2000 since the database is not 
updated. Also, in the map I didn't make those minor changes. Because when I 
try to erase those names, the map looks ugly. when i get back from california 
let's get together and discuss the feedbacks from traders.

sevil,

On behalf of the Jones Graduate School at Rice University, we would like to 
thank all of the company representatives who have submitted Action Learning 
Project (ALP) proposals. Currently, the ALP faculty committee is reviewing 
all proposals received.

We also want to remind those who are planning to submit proposals of our 
December 1st deadline. Please keep us updated on the status of your project. 
We are happy to answer any questions or provide assistance. 

Our goal is to have a good mix of projects from a variety of companies, and 
we are also pleased to accept multiple projects from one company. Thus far, 
many of our proposals are marketing and/or strategy related. To increase the 
diversity of projects, we are especially looking for ideas that give our 
students the opportunity to utilize finance skills. Of course, an ideal 
project is one that allows a student to use multiple skills.

Again, thank you for your continued interest in Rice University and the Jones 
School ALP program.

Jeff,

I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at a VP level.
According to new human resources procedures this decision requires
a support of three senior executives.

I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview
or just on your past interactions with him). You can send a reply to Norma 
Villarreal at H/R.

Thanks.

Vince

David,

I regret to inform you I am unable to attend the conference due to previous 
commitments.
Would you consider a speakers form our London office?

Any further thoughts on this ?

David

David,

Thanks for the invitation.
I shall check my schedule on Monday and will get back to you
regarding the conference.

I hope you will a very Happy Easter.

Vince

David Warwick <djw@kwi.com> on 04/12/2001 04:04:32 PM

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Gentlemen,

I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 
power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).

Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it 
very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this 
recommendation.

Vince

Lance Cunningham@ENRON on 11/09/2000 06:15:14 PM
Vince,

We have three options to increase our availability across Enron for the Power 
World load flow software.

Option 1, Upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only. Price 
$9,990.00 
This would give all of Enron the ability to perform load flows, but not 
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity (ATC) because only the 
Optimal Power Flow (OPF) version can perform that task.

Option 2, Site license for the load flow and purchase 1 OPF package for 
Walter Coffer's group.  Price $11,240.
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows and one other 
group the ability to determine marginal cost and ATC.

Option 3, Site license for load flows, OPF and ATC.  Price $14,990.00
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows, marginal 
cost, and ATC.

Regards,
Lance

Lance,

Please, ask Shirley to order.

Vince

Lance Cunningham@ENRON on 11/09/2000 06:16:43 PM

industry. The report takes a wide-ranging look at changes in the industry
with a heavy emphasis on FERC=01,s drive for RTOs. A major component of the
report will be detailed analysis of the FERC-mandated RTO filings by ISOs
and IOUs that make the October 15th filing.

Topics covered in the report include:
- The History of Transmission in the U. S.
- The Impact of FERC Orders 888 and 889
- The Creation of ISOs
- FERC=01,s Push Toward RTOs through the Merger Approval Process
- The Creation of TransCos
- Detailed Analysis of FERC Order 2000
- Detailed Discussion, Analysis, and Comparison of October 15 RTO Filings
-- including Innovative Rate Treatments
- Listing of All FERC Dockets and Policy Statements Regarding RTOs

Dear Vincent:

In anticipation of our meeting on December 6th at Wharton, I thought you 
might find the attached paper of some interest.  This relates primarily to 
pricing of risk management instruments for energy (an area of some interest 
to ENRON), but is applicable as well to a variety of other settings.  I know 
from our discussion that ENRON is interested in weather derivatives and other 
exotic options that might apply across several economic sectors.  The work 
here could inform this context, but it is better thought of as work that 
would inform risk management within a particular sector (e.g., electric 
power, chemicals, plastics, etc.).  It is related to some work that John 
Birge of Northwestern has been undertaking, and I understand that some of 
John's students may be working for you, so if you know any of these folks, 
please share it with them.

 <<OR-DKZ.pdf>> We are interested in calibrating the work presented here 
empirically and we might have a discussion of this, among other topics, when 
you are here on the 6th of December.

In the interim, if any of your staff wish to discuss this matter, please have 
them give me a call.

Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly 
Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting, 
followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings.

In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203 
merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be 
determined to be "workably competitive."  At the same time, FERC ordered a 
technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and 
urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next 
steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are 
provided below.

FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process

FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting 
requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as 
discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and 
more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over 
the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain 
entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products.

According to FERC, the draft Order:

-  revises the Commission's filing requirements to reflect existing merger 
policy based on FERC's 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines;
-  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market 
analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with 
potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes 
informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses.
-  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise 
competitive concerns; and
-  reduces the industry's regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing 
requirements.

The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal 
Register.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the 
Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC 
should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also 
analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC 
should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before, 
and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did 
mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission 
assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a 
separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative 
market analysis.

Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the 
approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the 
fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated 
that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting 
the public interest by stating that the process will be "efficient yet 
sufficient".  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule 
addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail 
competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality.

Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would 
improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the 
industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt, 
Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that 
will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants 
to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also 
stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERC's 
concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail 
competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and 
analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will 
provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into 
consideration the rapid changes in the industry.

Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was 
a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said 
that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERC's report before issuing their 
own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERC's expertise when 
reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries.  There is a major 
positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are 
reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work, he noted.  Because the 
RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market, he indicated, RTOs will help to 
preserve competition.  Therefore, more and larger RTOs should allow for more 
mergers, he said.  The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that 
joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger, but that it would certainly be 
viewed favorably.

NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably 
Competitive

In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be 
"workably competitive."  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical 
conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market 
participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and 
deadlines for resolution/implementation.

In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISO's September 1 and 8, 2000 
compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a 
temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISO's efforts to correct market 
flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had 
not yet satisfied the Commission's directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found 
that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the 
ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then 
gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISO's non-spinning reserve 
market by April 2001, as the ISO requested.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an "imperfect 
solution," yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the 
ISO's market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an 
opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls. 
Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack 
of the ISO's progress, but contended that significant outstanding issues must 
be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted.

In other action, FERC accepted NYISO's and NEPOOL's proposed Emergency Energy 
Transaction Agreement, allowing NYISO and ISO-NE to provide emergency service 
to each other (ER00-3638-000);

Stricken items included CAE-16 (NEPOOL's 64th Agreement Amendment proposing 
the elimination of In Service and instituting new rules governing certain 
import transactions (ER00-3577-000)).

There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.

Good Morning, Vince!

After going over our department list, I believe that, with the exception of a 
part-timer or two, we have covered everybody in the newsletter.  If we have 
recently hired someone who might not be on the list, would you please let me 
know?  Also, if you have a good article from someone that we can use for a 
Technical Corner, we will need that, too.  I'm going to put out a general 
call for TC material today.  Hopefully, we will get several things we can use 
for the coming weeks.

Are you available to go to dinner with John and his wife on next Tuesday?

--Stinson

Jean-Pierre,

Sorry. I have previous commitments on these days.

Vince

I would like to invite you to present a section on  Risk's course entitled, 
"Practical application of advanced stress  testing" which will be held in 
London (5 & 6 February 2001)  and New York (12 & 13 February 2001).
?
You have been recommended to me in the course of my  research as an authority 
in this field so I would be delighted for you to  present any of the sections 
that are still available on the attached  programme:

For London: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4 and  
For New York: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4 and 8

My market research indicates that advanced stress  testing is a highly 
interesting theme for a wide range of senior quantitative  analysts and risk 
managers. I anticipate the course to be technical and  practical in nature 
and assume a high level of knowledge from the delegates. It  aims to extend 
the scope of accepted practices into the new areas of liquidity  and credit 
risk stress testing and complement VaR methods by introducing new  risk 
measurement techniques that can be applied in an integrated  context.
?
Please contact me as soon as possible with an indication of which section  is 
most suitable for your current interests. If you feel that you will not be  
able to participate on this occasion, I would welcome any speaker 
suggestions  you may have. Please call me if you have any questions.
?
Many thanks,
?

While the thought is still on my mind,so you want think I'm
being selfish .

What  I am thinking we could do is send the Move Team , Help Desk  and  
Facilities

complimentary donuts from the Research Group during the holiday season.

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.

There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.

                    
                                              Thanks
                                                          Kevin Moore

Iris,

We can mention to Ben that the papers will be edited and 
combined into a coherent review.

Vince

Hi,

 Attached is a bit of feedback from Ben regarding the papers listed below.

 Can you help me out here?

Thanks,
Iris

Hi Iris

I would not include paper 8, as paper 7 supersedes it. Also how much 
rewriting of these papers do you envisage? Some of them are not up-to-date, 
or were written poorly and under time-pressure, so what do you envisage 
eventually sending to Duffie?

thanks

Ben

Hi Ben,

 I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative 
model study to be sent to Professor Duffie at Stanford.  

 These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted 
any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to 
read).

 Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,
Iris

Stinson ,Vince ,Zimin,

Here's a brief document on constraints on the shape of a smile for a fixed 
expiry date.
the constraints are neccessary and sufficient for no arbitrage in this case.
I've used a template created by Dr. Leppard which is why it looks so scary. 

If you need constraints in the time direction then I will have to think a 
little bit more about it.
I think constraints in this direction are very model depenendent e.g. 
stochastic volatility and local volatility models
will throw up different constraints.

Steve,
I am not sure if our traders (or quants for that matter) are aware of these 
constraints
and some desks are beginning to build smiles...

Regards
Sharad

Frank,

Great idea. I think it will be an opportunity to brainstorm about the problem.

Vince

Vince,
Now that's an interesting idea -- the problem is that I don't really HAVE any
work yet, as I am just now beginning!  But yes, why don't I put a talk 
together
as to what I'm thinking about, why it's important, why existing methods may be
inadequate, and how I think econometricians can contribute.  Does that sound
ok?

Vince,

No doubt you're very busy with these things, but I'd be very grateful if you

Today's bug patches and security alerts:

Microsoft releases patch for "Indexing Services Cross Site
Scripting" vulnerability

We reported this vulnerability in the last edition of the
newsletter - it was another Georgi Guninski find. Microsoft
Internet Information Server contains a security hole that could
allow a malicious user to inject code into a Web page that can
be used to access a remote computer. A similar problem was
discovered a few months ago in a previous version of the
software. For more information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-084.asp

Patch available for "Netmon Protocol Parsing" vulnerability

The Network Monitoring tool that ships with Windows NT, 2000
and Microsoft System Management Server contains a flaw that
could allow a malicious user to gain access to the affected
system. The problem resides in Netmon's parsers, which have
several unchecked buffers that can be exploited by sending a
malformed frame to the server. For more information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-083.asp

Patch available for "Malformed MIME Header" vulnerability

By passing specially formed MIME headers to Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5, an external user can crash the server. The system
will need to be rebooted before it will work again. For more
information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-082.asp
**********

Red Hat releases patch for kpackage

The kpackage module that comes with Red Hat Linux 7.0 crashes
when files are installed or uninstalled. Patches can be
downloaded from:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/i386/kpackage-1.3.10-7.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/i386/kpackage-1.3.10-7j1.i386.rpm

Updated svgalib package available

The svgalib that ships with Red Hat Linux Powertools contains a
bug that causes it to crash when the library is compiled into
other applications. Updates can be downloaded from:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/powertools/7.0/i386/svgalib-1.4.1-12.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/powertools/7.0/i386/svgalib-devel-1.4.1-12.i386.rpm

**********

HP reports vulnerability in dtterm

Hewlett-Packard has released a patch for the dtterm module
after it was discovered the module could be exploited to gain
root access. The alert does not mention how this could be
accomplished. Patches and workarounds can be found at the HP IT
Resource page:
http://itrc.hp.com
**********

Allaire issues patch for JRun DoS vulnerability

After a slew of patches last week for JRun, Allaire has
returned again this week with another patch. This one protects
against possible denial-of-service attacks. By sending
malformed URLs, the Java servlet handler leaks memory and could
consume all system resources. For more information and a patch:
http://www.allaire.com/handlers/index.cfm?ID=18085&Method=Full
**********

FreeBSD reports DoS vulnerability in getnameinfo() function

FreeBSD has issued a patch for the KAME project that fixes a
problem in the getnameinfo() function, a protocol-independent
name resolver library. By sending a malformed request to the
function, it is possible under certain circumstances to crash
the affected server. Patches can be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:63/getnameinfo.patch
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:63/getnameinfo.patch.asc

Top allows reading of kernel memory

The top module, which displays system resource usage, contains
a format string vulnerability that could allow unprivileged
users to execute arbitrary code on the affected FreeBSD
machine. For patches:
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:62/top.patch
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:62/top.patch.asc
**********

USSR reports flaw in Ultraseek search engine

USSR Labs is reporting a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
Ultraseek search engine. By sending malformed URLs to port 8765
(Ultraseek's default port) it is possible to crash the search
engine. For more information and links to patches:
http://www.ussrback.com/labs56.html
**********

AOL 6.0 wreaks havoc with some PCs

AOL 5.0 was an unmitigated disaster for the online giant. Soon
after its release, users began complaining about network
settings getting blown away, key Windows files being rewritten,
and in some cases, PCs becoming utterly inoperable. Some of the
exact same problems are beginning to crop up with AOL 6.0,
launched last week. Network World, 10/31/00.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

                   Poetry Analysis/ Discussion

      Tulips 

      The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
      I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
      As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
      I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
      I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
      And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

      They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
      Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
      The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
      They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
      Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
      So it is impossible to tell how many there are.

      My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
      They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep
      Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage
      My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
      My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
      Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

      I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat
      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
      They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
      Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
      I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
      Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
      I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.

      I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted
      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
      How free it is, you have no idea how free -
      The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
      And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
      It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
      Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

      The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
      Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
      Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
      They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down
      Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
      A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

      Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
      Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
      And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
      Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
      And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself
      The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

      Before they came the air was calm enough,
      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
      Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
      Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
      Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
      They concentrate my attention, that was happy
      Playing and resting without committing itself.

      The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
      They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
      And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
      Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.

Vince,

I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above 
group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more 
options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain 
what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la 
Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past.

Thanks,

Kevin

Ehud,

I want to invite Louise Kitchen to this conference.
She is the President of EnronOnLine.
Greg Whalley will be in London this day.

Vince,

>Given the energy-finance focus of the Conference, do you believe the
Networks topics is sufficiently energy-related?

Per my above concern, I'd like to discuss the matter with you further.
Thanks,

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Dear Vince,

I spoke with you briefly yesterday regarding Grant Masson.  You informed me
that he is no longer an Enron employee.  I have also been informed that
Grant has not yet been replaced.

I am inquiring because Infocast would like to have an Enron representative
speak at an upcoming conference entitled "Power Crisis in the West: Status
&
Outlook for Wholesale and Retail Markets".  Is there someone else at Enron
whom you would recommend to speak at the conference?

I have attached the program agenda for your review.  Knowing a bit about
Grant's expertise, I specifically wanted him to participate on the panel
"How Will Power Prices Play Out in 2001-2005?".  Please let me know if
there
is someone else at Enron whom I should speak with regarding this topic, or
others that may be of interest to Enron.

I look forward to working with Enron on this conference; it is certainly
going to be an exciting conference due to all of the controversy
surrounding
the situation in San Diego.

Efficient Available Transfer Capability Analysis using Linear Methods

Jamie Weber

PowerWorld Corporation

2004 S. Wright St, Suite 102, Urbana, IL? 61801

weber@powerworld.com

?

Abstract

?

While the concept of ATC has been around for decades, the desire to

calculate its value on a large scale is new.? Organizations responsible for

the reliable operation of the transmission system are given the task of

determining ATC values on a daily basis.? ATC calculations typically includ=
e

a large number of contingencies as well as multiple transfer directions and

multiple system conditions.? This presents a labor-intensive task for those

required to calculate ATC values.

?

Because of these circumstances, Powerworld Corporation was approached by th=
e

Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to develop a new software product for

their use in calculating ATC values.? The new ATC tool, integrated into the

Simulator OPF/ATC software product, was the culmination of this work.? This

talk will cover the basic engineering requirements and mathematics that

governed the development of the ATC tool.? The concept of Linear ATC

analysis will be introduced, along with the underlying mathematics of Linea=
r

ATC analysis including

?

*? Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs)

*? Line Outage and Closure Distribution Factors (LODFs/LCDFs)

*? Outage Transfer Distribution Factors (OTDFs)

?

Attention will be paid to demonstrating the accuracy of Linear ATC on large

systems as well as demonstrating what Linear ATC does not model.? Examples

will be shown on both small and large-scale systems using Simulator OPF/ATC=
.

?

Other special topics integrated into PowerWorld Simulator OPF/ATC will also

be discussed such as (1) the inclusion of phase-shifting transformers

directly in linear analysis, and (2) the iteration of linear ATC for use in

modeling controller changes.

IP Address for Netmeeting

?

Read the instructions to down load and install Netmeeting.? At about 12.50

PM Central Time on November 7, 2000, dial the following IP address in

Netmeeting?? 128.174.115.8.? Please make sure the resolution on your machin=
e

is set to 1024 x 768 .? This will be the setting on the machine at which th=
e

Power Point slides originate.? If your machine is not set to the same

resolution, the slides on your machine during the seminar will lose

information.

   Highlights:
DNRC Update
Many of you have expressed surprise and outrage that Dogbert was
not in the presidential debates.  That's what you think.  What you
don't realize is that Al Gore is actually a robot, remotely
controlled by Dogbert.  The real Al Gore was abducted months ago
and is being held in a safe place.  The strange thing is that the
real Al Gore is a robot too.

How I Spent My Summer Vacation
This newsletter is a bit late because this year I took my first
vacation ever.  It was a cruise to Alaska.  I will summarize it
here so you don't need to go.

Alaska is a large cold place with approximately six residents who
would inbreed if they found each other more attractive.

There was scenery.

Alaska has bald eagles, which are very rare because of Rogaine(tm).

From the cruise ship you can see bears on the shore.  Bears are
about the size of a pencil eraser, at least the ones I saw.  They
might look bigger up close.

If you wondered where all the senior citizens went, they were on my
cruise ship.  That was fine with me; when I'm in bear country I
like to be surrounded by people who can't outrun me.  And it was
fun to see the bald eagles swooping down to our deck and carrying
off the elderly with their majestic talons.  (Why those elderly
people had majestic talons I'll never know.)

The ship had a gym in the bow, with large windows.  When I used the
exercise bike I pretended that the ship was being powered by my
pedaling.  I almost passed out trying to ram a tugboat.  They are
faster than they look.

The cruise ship had something they call a gambling casino.  It
wasn't the kind where you sometimes get back a small portion of
your money.  But that was okay with me because when you're in the
middle of the ocean, and you're not the designated sailor, shoving
money into a small hole in a colorful blinking box can be loads of
fun.

There was food.

If I left anything out, drop by the house and I'll show you the
pictures.

Cat Stretching
My cat Sarah used to be short and stubby.  Check out my streaming
home video at Lycos Video Center to see how I upgraded her.  Here's
the URL:

http://video.lycos.com/myvideocenter/viewvmail.asp?vm=338035&e=33KUVI9WUjIaU&r

Pillows
Until I obtained good taste, I thought the proper number of pillows
for a bed was one per head.  It's embarrassing to think how wrong I
was.  Thanks to the help of a professional decorator, and Pam, my
bed now has fifteen pillows.  Six of them are big honkers that look
very impressive until they are thrown on the floor at night.  Four
of them are decorative pillows featuring the cheerful faces of
various dogs; those go on the floor at night too. One pillow is a
log-shaped thing called a bolster; it has no purpose that I can
discern.  Two are "Bucky(tm)" pillows that support one's neck
should that become necessary on an emergency basis.  When not in
use, they go on the floor with the bolster.

And then there are two pillows that can be used for -- of all
things -- your head. Those stay on the bed.

The bedspread somehow transmogrified into something
Frenchy-sounding, called a duvey or doovay or something like that.
It is so heavy that I put a lump of coal under it and I check its
progress every few days.  You can't actually sleep under it,
especially on warm California nights, but it sure is pretty.  That
goes on the floor too.

Thirteen pillows plus the doovay are strewn around the bedroom
floor all day.  I fantasize about someday making the bed just to
see what it would look like.  Or maybe I'll just spend that same
energy building a full-scale replica of Stonehenge.

I am delighted with my cornucopia of bedding because I know that
should those beautiful items somehow find their way from the floor
to the bed, the sight would make even the most jaded observer step
back and say, "Wow.  It must be a pain in the ass to have that many
pillows."

Incompetence Pays
A true tale from the field...

My group ordered 14 new workstations for nearly $70,000.  The
contracts person (Induhvidual) responsible for buying the PCs
announced that she was able to negotiate a better price than we had
indicated, saving $14,000 on the purchase.  As a result of the cost
savings, she was granted an award of $7,000, 50% of the cost
savings.  This $7,000 award came out of my group's budget.

When we received the 14 workstations, we discovered how she had
saved the $14,000.  She had removed all the monitors from the
order.  We received 14 computers with no monitors.

We were forced to file a new order for the 14 monitors.  Since the
monitors were not being bought as part of a package, the new price
for the monitors came to $19,000, $5,000 more than our original
order.

The end result was that the $70,000 worth of workstations actually
cost us $82,000, and the Induhvidual was rewarded for her good
work.

Looking Busy
Here's an excellent method for getting paid to do nothing, courtesy
of a devious DNRC member:

Scatter some papers over your desk as though you are working on
them.  Open your middle desk drawer (directly over your lap), place
your favorite magazine in the drawer and spend the next hour
reading it.  Put a pen in one hand and keep that hand in the
drawer.  If someone enters your office, remove the pen from the
drawer and close it in one smooth motion.

Two Dimensional Management
True story: Our senior execs decided they needed to be more
"visible" to the unwashed masses.  The solution: cardboard cutouts
of the VPs and senior VPs in the break rooms.

Induhviduals Speak
Here are two recent statements, both from the same Induhvidual, as
recorded by a vigilant DNRC member.

"I'm caught between a rock and a stone."

"My son has a huge appetite.  He has a bottomless leg."

Here are some more gems, all uttered by another prolific
Induhvidual.  (I might use some of these myself someday.)

"It's like being a monkey with chickens on your back!"

"Are you too blind to remember?"

"Anyone could go to that person and say, 'I need a bell on the side
of the elephant.'"

"He has too many fingers in the dike."

"It's like an engineer falling out of a building."

"Smooth as pie."

"I have no idea what that is.  Thank goodness we didn't order
three!"

"The active part is there, the proactive is not."

"Same crap, different fork."

Lazy Entrepreneur
Did you ever have a great business idea but you were too lazy to do
anything about it?  It's frustrating because other people don't
realize how brilliant you are.  To the ignorant observer it appears
you are sitting on your couch drinking soda, burping, and eating
the remnants of potato chips off your shirt.  You look lazy and
dim-witted when in truth you are lazy and brilliant.  It's totally
unfair.

That's why United Media and I created the Lazy Entrepreneur web
site. It's a message board where you can post your brilliant and
generally impractical ideas.  Or make snide remarks about those who
do.  You'll get all the benefits of displaying your brilliance in a
public forum while using no more energy than it takes to type. And
no one will see the embarrassed look on your face when a stranger
tells you your invention has existed for years and you can buy it
at any Target store.

I seeded the Lazy Entrepreneur with a bunch of my own brilliant and
impractical ideas. For example, I'd like to see a prescription pill
container with a built-in manual dial on the bottom, labeled for
each day of the week, so I can use it to remember if I already took
a pill that day.  If the pill has to be taken twice a day, the dial
would have two positions for each day.  If I had a pill container
like that I could stop worrying whether I took my pill and start
worrying whether I remembered to turn the dial.  For some reason,
that seems better to me.

If you don't want to give away your brilliant ideas, the web site
has information on copyrights, patents, trademarks and the like.

DNRC members will get an exclusive preview of the Lazy
Entrepreneur.  It won't be linked from Dilbert.com until next week,
but you can join in the beta test by following the link below.

Wise Crack
In a recent Sunday strip, Wally's co-workers held him down while
Catbert branded him with a hot iron.  An eighth of an inch of
Wally's butt crack was visible in the original drawing.  I was
informed that readers would complain that Wally's butt crack was
destroying the moral fiber of the planet, so we removed the butt
crack line from the print version and included it in the web
version.  This allows us to test the idea that exposure to cartoon
butt cracks is bad for children.  In theory, the kids who see the
unedited web version will grow up to be serial killers, marketing
professionals and auditors.  They might even have butt cracks of
their own, possibly using mirrors to ogle them.  Or they might
become butt crack addicts.  Adult magazines might be printed that
feature nothing but one-eighth inch black lines.

The possibilities are frightening.

True Tales of Induhviduals
Those In-duh-viduals continue to amaze and amuse us.  Here now,
some more true tales as reported by DNRC operatives in the field.

True Tale 1
My boss handed me ten pages of data and asked me to scan them, use
optical character recognition (OCR) to get them into our
spreadsheet software and rearrange the columns to meet his needs.
After several hours spent scanning and fixing OCR errors, I learned
that the spreadsheets had originally been e-mailed to my boss as an
attachment.  It seems that my boss didn't remember how to rearrange
columns using spreadsheet software so he figured it would be
easiest to print the file and have me do it instead.

True Tale 2
Me:  "I have many more responsibilities than I did when I was first
hired, so you should pay me more."

Pointy-Haired Boss: "No, because if you weren't here, we'd just do
without the extra functions that you're performing, so why should
we pay you to do them?"

True Tale 3
I'm the webmaster at my company. I asked the PR director to give me
the most up-to-date list of our business locations so I could
update the web. She downloaded my web pages and gave them to me.

True Tale 4
I was having trouble getting my boss to read my e-mail.  Upon
investigation he told me he got too many messages and couldn't read
them all.  I investigated further and discovered that he was using
the alphabetical sort feature in Outlook, and since my name started
with a "P" he never got down to my e-mails.

True Tale 5
The following is the real reason dot-coms are burning money.  Our
product development team was meeting with the VP for product
development to unveil our product.  It was fully functional to the
point of beta-testing.  At the conclusion of our presentation, the
VP responded that this was great, since he had been in discussions
with an external IT firm about outsourcing the development.  "Maybe
we'll be able to get them to do it cheaper if they know we already
have a working product."

True Tale 6
A friend told me that his supervisor permitted the receptionist to
make up lost time on a Saturday, when they are closed.

True Tale 7
This is the real signature line of every mail one of my bosses
sends:

             (Company name) ... Shiting ideas to solutions

I think he meant shiFting.

True Tale 8
My high school French teacher isn't the sharpest crayon in the box.
She was playing a French song off the Internet, and the class
wanted to know who the band was. She looked at the computer for a
minute, walked to the chalkboard and promptly wrote: MP3.

True Tale 9
Sometimes, Induhvidualism can work out for the best.

I work at a movie theatre chain that has been sold to another movie
theatre chain.  Technically, everyone in my company is being laid
off.  Per company policy, all employees will be receiving severance
pay before going back to the *exact same* jobs they had before the
switch.

True Tale 10
An example from our bright travel department:

"Regarding your travel request for Nashville.  You are looking at a
Southwest flight at 1740.  Would this be a.m. or p.m.?"

True Tale 11
One day on the way to work my wife and I passed by a park and saw
an Induhvidual cleaning up trash in the park using one of those
"garbage harpoons" and a bucket.

We watched her walk along, picking up garbage and smoking her
cigarette as she went. Just as I started to say how dedicated she
must be for not even stopping her work for a smoke break, she took
the cigarette butt from her mouth and flicked it on the ground and
continued cleaning, leaving the cigarette butt smoldering on the
ground behind her.

True Tale 12
Here is a wonderful and true story about how the bureaucratic mind
works.

I live in California, and the large building I work in is cooled by
drawing in outside air during the months of June and May. (This
saves lots of money because the huge air conditioner remains off.)

But one June day it was unseasonably hot, so I called the
maintenance department to come and turn on the large roof-mounted
air conditioner.  The following conversation is a jewel.

ME:  It is very hot and uncomfortable in this building.  Will you
please turn on the air conditioning?
 
HER:  Uh, we always leave the air-conditioning off during this
month.

ME:  Yes, I know.  But it is hot outside, and worse inside.

HER:  I am sorry, but this is just part of our yearly program.  We
don't use air conditioning in June.

ME:  But it is getting unbearable in here.

The above exchange was repeated several times, and finally, with
some irritation in her voice, she delivered the following, and hung
up.

HER:  Sir, I am sorry you are uncomfortable over there, but we only
control the air-conditioning; we have no control over the weather!

True Tale 13
An angry Induhvidual recently accused me of "cheating" at our
various work meetings.  I asked how.  The Induhvidual replied that,
"You always prepare for our meetings and that gives you an unfair
advantage."

Dogbertian Poll
Dogbert might have inspired this idea.  Someone recently spammed a
bunch of people with a message that asked them to call a 900 number
to vote on the issue of whether spam was a good thing or a bad
thing.  It only cost you $1.50 per minute to complain about spam.

Dogbert Answers My Mail
In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to
answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have
been changed to make them funnier.

Dear Mr. Adams,

I am studying Social Communication in Argentine.  I wonder if you
could send by e-mail all the information about people who work in
offices, the relationship between them and the work environment and
also about office design.

I wish you could send all the information you can get by e-mail
otherwise you can send me a list of bibliography to search
information about the topics in Spanish.

I beg you to answer in a short time, my e-mail.

Romero

Dear Remora,

I'm glad you begged.  People in the United States are too proud to
get right down on all fours and whimper when they want something.
I will send the information you requested right away.  If you don't
see it within a day, call my 900 number and complain.  It is only
$1.50 per minute.

Sincerely,

Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

My Latin teacher gives us extra credit if we bring in anything that
contains one or more of our 'daily phrases,' such as 'Ad Hoc,'
'Ante Meridian,' and 'Circa.'  I was wondering if you could make me
a cartoon including many Latin phrases that would still be used
today.  This would be a big help.

Abe

Dear Ape,

Latin is what's known as a dead language.  It got that way because
every time a Latin student asked for a special cartoon he was slain
by a hideous monster that lived under his bed.  I'm not saying that
will happen to you, right away.  Anyway, here's a little story that
uses your daily phrases.

My poor Irish ante Meridian was broke.  So she circa the block in
her hometown of Unum until she saw a fish fall from the back of a
fish delivery truck.  It was a carpe worth ten cents.  She thought
that that carpe diem would get her out of hock, or at least reduce
it, but she used so much gas driving in circa that it turned out to
be an ad hoc situation.  So she ate a potato and went to visit her
niece, Pati O'Furniture who lived in the town of Pluri.  She took
the E Pluri Bus from Unum.

Sincerely,

Dogbert

After speaking with Iain Russell today and him coming to the Weather Group
noticing the fax machine , he mentioned that it is outdated and costing
a lot of money.
He made a phone call to get the old fax machine removed therefore we 
will receive new models soon.
We would save half the rental cost on these new machines.

Pavel, Many thanks for your note.

I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, I'm 
trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed 
income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a 
guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The 
digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to 
and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it 
'commercial purpose'. 

I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the 
rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets 
(electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).

It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a 'value judgement' or am I 
wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate 
this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or 
likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it 
becomes non arm's length and does not pass the smell test?

Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also 
be appreciated.

Gillian. 

Digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market. Nobody ever 
asked me to show quotes in the OTC market. The only time we encountered them 
was when producers, brought by our marketing team, wanted to sell a 
knock-outable swap, whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange 
for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level. This 
structure had a digital put embedded in it, although the customers didn't 
necessarilly know that. The companies were US oil and gas producers: Venoco, 
Titan, Magnum Hunter, Patiena Oil & Gas, Belco, Central Resources. It was 
about 1 year ago. In the OTC market, at about the same time, I asked for 
quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital Cal 00 $16 swaption to 
Elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that I cannot recall.

I hope this helps.

Pavel

Vince,

A couple of things.  First, I'm planning on your arrival at Baylor sometime
the afternoon of Monday, November 13.  I want to set up a small seminar for
our faculty if you want to do it.  I will schedule it for 4 pm so if you
can arrive in Waco (Continental has several flights in each day) sometime
in early afternoon I'll pick you up.  The Ex MBA class begins at 6 p.m. and
I'll set you up to speak first for about an hour with q&a to follow.  How
about putting together some thoughts related to our paper?  You can do the
same talk for the faculty in the early afternoon.  You and I can get then
together on Tuesday morning to work on the paper.  I have a 1 p.m. class on
Tuesday is my only constraint.  If you have time to hang around we'll do
the talk a third time in that class.  By then I suspect we will have made
some real progress.

Next point, we have both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling set up for Dec 4th in
the afternoon.  I plan to get some questions together for them based on our
discussions next Monday and Tuesday.

I'm really looking forward to seeing you next week and to working on our
paper.

Have a great week.  I'm off to Austin and New Orleans this week, thus the
reason for the early message on the class a week from tomorrow.

Take care.

John

signed up for an interview for the Associate program at Enron, and I hope to
speak to you again through involvement in the Associate program.  Thanks
again.

Dear Vincent:

In anticipation of our meeting on December 6th at Wharton, I thought you 
might find the attached paper of some interest.  This relates primarily to 
pricing of risk management instruments for energy (an area of some interest 
to ENRON), but is applicable as well to a variety of other settings.  I know 
from our discussion that ENRON is interested in weather derivatives and other 
exotic options that might apply across several economic sectors.  The work 
here could inform this context, but it is better thought of as work that 
would inform risk management within a particular sector (e.g., electric 
power, chemicals, plastics, etc.).  It is related to some work that John 
Birge of Northwestern has been undertaking, and I understand that some of 
John's students may be working for you, so if you know any of these folks, 
please share it with them.

 <<OR-DKZ.pdf>> We are interested in calibrating the work presented here 
empirically and we might have a discussion of this, among other topics, when 
you are here on the 6th of December.

In the interim, if any of your staff wish to discuss this matter, please have 
them give me a call.

Bryan,

I am glad we could help. Let me talk to Vasant about Amitava's support
for you.

Vince

Bryan Seyfried
11/05/2000 05:26 AM
Really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the 
quantitative work we have undertaken.  As you are aware much of the work 
requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the 
significant contribution that Amitava's experience and expertise has provided 
in a very short timeframe.

As you might expect, this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated 
support from someone with Amitava's background.  It is imperative that we 
leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights 
into our project.  This will not only speed up the work considerably but also 
ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us.

I would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure Amitava is more 
integrated into our efforts.  I realize it will be difficult to free him up 
but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody.

some early ideas:  

have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support.  this 
should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant 
effort for the project and then continue with Amitava a full time EC.com 
resource working from Houston.  This is likely my preference.

or

agree a schedule of regular trips which allows Amitava to provide critical 
insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract 
his experience on an ongoing basis.

Let's discuss before I talk to john about the practicalities

Thanks for your assistance.

I wanted to email you and let you know how sorry I am that I was not able to 
make your presentation at Carnegie Mellon.  I really was looking forward to 
the trip and the presentation but unfortunately since I have been on the road 
a lot lately things started backing up in the office.  After my meeting on 
Thursday there was no way I would make the 6pm flight and my original flight 
would have put me in Pittsburgh to late for the presentation.  

Anyway, I hope you understand and I am looking forward to working with you in 
December for the interviews on campus.  Maybe once you return you can give me 
a recap of the days events.  In the meantime if you need any assistance 
please do not hesitate to call.  

Thank you,

Hi Vince

As you know I'll be celebrating my 40th at the end of this month with a party 
at my house. 

It will be a fairly informal affair with relatives, neighbours and friends 
from work.

The date is the evening of Friday, 1st December (so it doesn't conflict with 
the Enron Party), and I'd like to invite you and your family join us.

If you can make it, please let me know so I can get some idea of numbers (I'm 
currently expecting around 50-60)

regards

Steve,

RAC will be a bit unhappy about it. I think that Bjorn will object to it.
Let me talk to you tomorrow over the phone and discuss it.
The question is how to present it to RAC in a such a way that
Rodrigo will not be put in a bad light.

Vince

Steven Leppard
11/06/2000 06:37 AM
Hi Vince

I've had a chat with Rodrigo Lamas, who is a bit unhappy in his current role 
in RAC (he wants to be a bit more proactive, and finds the inertia 
frustrating).  I would be very interested in bringing him into Research with 
responsibility for VaR/risk mgt, which is where his professional experience 
lies.  He also has a PhD in optimization from Imperial College London which 
I'm sure we can make use of.

There will obviously be some political issues involving such a move only 4 
months into his career at Enron, and if you're able then I'm sure he'd 
appreciate a chat with you.

We're awaiting your response before Rodrigo mentions this to anyone else.

Steve

With pleasure.

modifications clearly highlighted.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions or comments.

Frank,

Dec 14   would be  better for us. We have already scheduled
an internal presentation on December 7.  Please, go ahead and make a 
reservation.
The best place to stay is Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree Downtown
(within a walking distance to Enron). It is important to specify the downtown 
location for both hotels.

Vince

Sounds good, Vince.  How about Dec 7?  The roundtrip coach fare, regardless of
airline, is about $1900.  I hope that won't break the bank.  Once I have your
approval, I'll go ahead and book it.  Best, Frank

Dear Vince

I hope you are well and prospering at Enron.  I'm still suffering from
culture shock here.  I know that you have an interest and expertise in value
at risk and so I hope that you will be able to complete the review on the
manuscript that we sent to you very soon.  Please advise.

Becky,

I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you 
already.
I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere 
Overdyke),
oil trading and coal.

For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.

Vince

Becky Pham

Shirley,

GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going 
to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to 
think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from 
Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?  CALME is going to 
split into 3 BUs and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for Research 
supports.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx.  

Louise,

Would you consider being a keynote speaker at this conference (Feb 22 
evening)?

The conference will be held in Austin.

We have a very good relationship with UT and we are helping them to organize 
this conference.

I shall be glad to provide you more information about the event.

Vince 
Vince,

As promised, enclosed please find a brief description of the proposed Feb.
22 - 23 Energy Finance Conference, suitable for dissemination to your
colleagues:

"As Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research
(CEFER), my colleagues and I are planning a practitioner-industry
Conference in Spring 2001, Feb. 22 - 23, to discuss four topics:  Risk
management, Deregulation, Real options, and International/globalization.
Other than the Univ. of Texas participants and selected academics from
other institutions, we expect most participants at the Conference to be
energy practitioners from Houston.  The Conference will begin with a dinner
and address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri."

Given the energy-finance focus of the Conference, do you believe the
Networks topics is sufficiently energy-related?

Best,
Ehud

Michael and Steve -

Thanks for coming to the Risk Forum luncheon today, we enjoyed hearing about 
the new business opportunity.

Attached is a first draft of the approval form we'll want to circulate to the 
various functional signers for approval prior to sending to Rick Buy and 
Skilling for approval and granting of the limits - after we've completed.  I 
cut and pasted from information you provided, and have highlighted the areas 
that are missing information.  Please review and coordinate with the various 
functions and get back to David Port or to me with the missing information or 
any comments you have.

As for the Risk Assessment, we might want to take a look at that - I just cut 
and pasted the SWOT analysis in from the business plan so far.  I'll talk to 
David.  If any of the functional areas have specific issues we should 
document that will need to be addressed later at some point, let's make a 
note of them in this interim policy document so we don't lose track of them.

I'm also enclosing the Authorized Trader List  and Authorized Products List 
that will need to be completed once we figure out who will be designated the 
official head trader for this commodity group (will that be you?  Wade 
Dosier?), and the presentation prepared by you for those who did not receive.

As far as Market Risk Management, we work as a team here, so feel free to 
contact either David at x39823 or me at x30429 - I handle the risk policy and 
procedures side, whereas David  is taking the lead on this new initiative 
from a market risk perspective and will be addressing specific business and 
technical issues.  Christian LeBroc at x58062 will also be working for David 
reviewing the quantitative risk parameters.  

Regards,
Cassandra.

Frank,

Yes, I would be very interested in meeting with you in Houston in December.
The best day for visit would be Thursday when my group has a lunch meeting
and you could meet the rest of the research unit.

Please, let me know what day would work for you. We shall be very glad to
cover the cost of your trip.

Vince

I 

Hi Vince,
Are you still interested in my visiting for a day, perhaps in Dec or
Jan?  I have begun a project on unobserved-components modeling of
weather patterns, so it would be productive and fun to compare notes.
Best,
Frank

Vince,
Just wanted to follow up on our conversation yesterday regarding Kin Tso.  
Charlene actually called Kin yesterday to let him know that your group was 
interested in him as a direct hire and would be contacting him this week.  As 
we discussed, Kin was told that his quantitative skills were a much better 
fit for your group instead of our rotating Associate program.  We let him 
know that the Associate program would not be making him an offer but he is 
being considered for a direct hire.  Kin was receptive and is looking forward 
to hearing from you.  We will consider this issue closed from the Associate 
and Analyst Program.  We hope that you might find a direct hire fit for him 
in your area.  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  
Thanks so much.

Jana,

This weekend would work for me. I shall be in Houston.

Hi Carrie,

It was great meeting with you and Dean Whitaker again last Friday, as well as 
Mr. Westbrook.
 As we discussed,  I have submitted the Action Learning Program materials to 
Vince Kaminski, our managing director of Risk analysis and Corporate 
Research.  I'll be following up with him, and his recommendations for project 
proposals next week.
  Also, I've discussed with our University Affairs team setting up the 
faculty tours--we're ready when you are!!  The sooner the better--I'd love to 
get these in pretty immediately, and in any event, before the reception at 
the end of the month.  I"ll have Cindy Derecskey in my group eMail you--she 
is prepared to set these tours up.  

I look forward to continuing to develop the multiple potential dynamics of 
the Enron-Rice relationship!

Thanks!

--Christie.

ps:  Thanks so much for the Crystal Rice Owl--my participation as a judge in 
the Rice Invitational Case Competition was my pleasure indeed!

Christie,

I enjoyed visiting with you last week at the Jones School.  Thanks for
taking time to come see us.  I wanted to follow up with you regarding the
Action Learning Project program and Enron tour.  We hope to have Enron as
part of the program in 2001.  Please let me know how I can help make this
happen.  I look for the program to be full before the deadline of December
1st.  Also, I am happy to help organize a group to tour Enron.  If you were
to participate in the ALP program, January/February might be a good time to
put something together with key faculty and the ALP team.  Let me know your
thoughts.

Again, many thanks for your continued support of the Jones School.  I look
forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks  Margaret
	
	

Margaret Carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with Nesbitt.  
Vince will check with ENA to see if they also want to attend.  I would also 
like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any "affiliate" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.

Please, let me know what you think.

Dr. Kaminski:

I am a Ph.D. student here at Carnegie Mellon who has a long-standing
interest in the energy industry.

I have recently developed the framework of a simple model for electricity
prices that I would like your opinion on. Could you please chalk out some
time for me during your CMU visit this Friday?

Unlike traditional electricty pricing models, which assume that the
log-price is a sum of a couple of stochastic factors, I assume that some
fundamentals of the electricity market are driven by stochastic factors.
Next, given the current values of these factors, price is determined by
economic forces of profit maximization by price setting electricity
generators. Unlike typical factor models, the factors in my model are
potentially observable.

Mr. Huang,

We would be happy to demonstrate the features and functionality of the
WeatherDelta tool set for your team at Enron.  Early next week (Tuesday or
Wednesday) are both possible, as well as early the following week.  The
demonstration can take 90 minutes or more, depending on the number of
questions and the level of detail.

Ideally, you could provide us with some of your data and we could
demonstrate how to value a full-requirements contract to service that
particular load.  To do this we will need one or more years of hourly
consumption data, and the general location of the load.  Ideal data formats
are csv files of either 365 rows x 25 columns (date,hr1,hr2..) or 8760 rows
x 3 columns (date,hr,load).  In lieu of using your data, we will provide
sample load data.

Please feel free to call me and we can discuss schedules and the particulars
of the product overview and demonstration.

Thank you for your interest,

At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly 
awaited probe into California's summer power crisis, concluding that under 
certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and 
unreasonable power rates due to California's "seriously flawed" market 
structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions 
throughout the West.

The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000 
Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power 
Markets, is available at the following website: 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm
In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural 
changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and 
solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also 
been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other 
remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners 
supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker 
and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and 
Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either 
"over-reached" or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is 
expected to be issued by year's end.

At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their 
continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve 
state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day 
ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3) 
siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient 
reserve requirements.

Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy

In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:

(1) Eliminating the state's mandatory requirement that the state's 
investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing
these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other 
alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.

(2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their 
transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for 
under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in 
order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.

(3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO 
and PX.

(4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a 
temporary $150/MWh "soft cap" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150 
from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers 
bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly 
basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to 
report monthly information on such bids.  The Commission's price mitigation 
measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.

(5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the state's ratepayers and 
utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to 
potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until 
December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if 
FERC finds non-competitive behavior.

(6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand 
response management programs.

Separately, the draft order rejected the ISO's request for an extension of 
its current purchase price cap authority, and the PX's request for price 
capping authority.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when 
a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at 
the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the 
order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California 
markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the 
"buy and sell" mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long 
list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the 
Commission prescribe specific remedies.

Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "soft cap" 
concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase 
incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He 
believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in 
facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive 
for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he 
would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but 
allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO 
filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods, 
preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on 
their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally 
focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation 
capacity.

Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC 
cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commission's 
job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct "command and 
control."  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that 
they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments 
on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential 
reporting requirements.

Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive 
approach.  He feels that the Congress has "put its thumb on the scale" in the 
Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to 
be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right 
direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over 
reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to 
reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell 
mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the 
$150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to 
issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a 
certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market 
price volatility.

Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted 
that this is "no time to pull punches."  He emphasized that the Commission 
needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitt's warning 
that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on 
track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he 
stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing 
jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the 
state level are slowing the "meandering transition" to competition.  He feels 
that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these 
problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California 
is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region 
for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things 
work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will 
fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further 
evidence provided by staff's ongoing investigation.

Vince,

I left a message with one of Yaron's roommates on Thursday afternoon for him 
to call ASAP for an interview on Sunday.  I guess he took the wrong number 
down but I do not understand this because the roommate read the number back 
to me and it was correct.  When I did not hear from Yaron I called on Friday 
and left a voice mail with my cell and office numbers.  I still did not hear 
from him and called again yesterday morning.  I finally received a call at 4 
pm yesterday but by that time my team and myself were half way back to 
Houston.  Sorry it did not work out.  I have a call into Charlene Jackson as 
to how she wants me to proceed and I will get back with you.

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk

Vice President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that 
combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and 
financial  institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Pierre-Philippe,

The time of the presentation, 11:30 is fine with me.
I shall arrive Thu evening and I shall get to the hotel by cab. Thanks
for your kind offer to meet me at the airport but I shall be arriving at late 
hour
and don't want to inconvenience you. Kevin Kindall from Enron will come with 
me.
I shall also need a projector for my M/S Power Point presentation on
"Volatility in the US Power Markets".
I shall be very glad to meet with Duane. 

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

The presentation is scheduled on friday the 3rd at 11.30 so that New York
Students can attend.

Would you like me to get you at the airport?

If you want I can also organize a short meeting with professor Seppi which
is very interested in energy derivatives.

My goal is to make your trip to Pittsburgh as pleasant as possible.
Therefore if there is anything I can do to help (I am sounding a little
repetitive...I know) let me know.

Sincerely,

Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie

I can find someone or else do it myself.    Can you specify the historical 
period and also how far out the curve we are providing?

Is it just WTI?

--Stinson

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.

Please, let me know what you think.

our forward oil curves (with approval of Greg Whalley) to some academics.
What is your position on this request?

Vince

Jens Gobel@ENRON
10/26/2000 12:06 PM
Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM
Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

Olaf Korn

p.s. Bei Rueckfragen stehe ich Ihnen jederzeit gern zur Verfuegung

Zimin,

 to generalize your initial comment, for any process dS = Mu(S,t)*S*dt + 
Sigma(S,t)*S*dz,
the delta-hedging argument leads to the Black-Scholes PDE.  
This is true for any arbitrary functions Mu and Sigma, and so includes GBM, 
Mean Reversion, and others.
There is no problem with this, because in the risk-neutral world, which is 
what you enter if you can hedge,
the drift of the "actual" process is irrelevant.

I believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price 
for Mean Reversion process.  This can only happen if the asset is not 
hedgeable, and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the 
option pricing.   If you assume that the underlying is a non-traded factor, 
then the PDE will have to reflect the market price of risk, and the drift of 
the actual process is then reflected in the PDE.

Vasant

Dear All,

I have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95.    Hope you can give 
me a convincing answer .

Zimin

In deriving BS differential equation, we assume the underlying follows GBM

ds= mu*s*dt + sigma*s*dz

where mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.

Then we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation 
for the option price, regardless
of mu.  

With the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula.  Fine. No 
problem.

Question comes here.   Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows, 
say, mean-reverting process

ds=beta(alpha-s)dt + sigma*s*dz

Apparantly, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However, 
using the delta hedging argument,
we still get the same BS differential equation, with the same boumdary 
condition, we get the same BS formula.  
Not fair !

From another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the 
underlying, which is the lognormal distribution.
My thinking is: can I drive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE 
?  The answer should be yes, but got to be
from a different PDE rather than BS PDE.  Then what we do about the 
delta-hedging argument ?

Thanks.

As you suggested, I splited the paper into two parts, the first one
devotes to the FX market and second one to gas market.  Attached

Sanjeev and John,

Thanks for your continuing interest for the storage model.   The storage 
model is
the extension to the swing model we sent you earlier, in the case of swing, 
you are only allowed to
withdraw or hold. 

 I will add some heading to the "log" files from the 
model.  These files includes

Curve.txt  which records the price trajectories of the  first 10 simulations,

Op???.txt, where ??? are the numbers represent the day,  these files record
decisions for each gas level, each price node for the given day.

All these files are C:\temp.

I did a presentation about the storage valuation, which explains the basic 
ideas.  
Take a look, I am open for more discussions.

Zimin

Keith,

The article I mentioned.

                  By Michael Santoli

                  Here it is more than six months since even the most 
intransigent last-minute
                  filers wrote checks to the IRS to render to the government 
its due for their
                  financial good fortune in 1999. By rights, this should be a 
season relatively
                  free of concerns about taxes, notwithstanding the 
presidential candidates'
                  parrying over whose tax-cut math features more fuzz.

                  And yet, for anyone with a dollar in the stock market 
(which in recent weeks
                  has likely been reduced to loose change), the looming 
demands of this year's
                  levies on capital gains have helped to make this month yet 
another taxing
                  October for investors.

                                                 The jump-and-stumble course 
the
                                                 major stock indexes have 
taken this
                                                 year is being blamed for a
                                                 particularly intense effort 
among
                                                 mutual-fund managers and 
other big
                                                 investors to sell their 
losers. The
                                                 steep ramp-up in stocks that
                                                 persisted from the fall of 
1999
                                                 through the first quarter of 
this year
                                                 -- led by the technology
                                                 must-haves -- left funds 
with ripe
                                                 profit-taking opportunities 
when the
                                                 Nasdaq surge flagged in 
April. This
                  sell-high activity generated heavy capital gains in many 
portfolios -- tax
                  liabilities that managers have been rushing to offset with 
realized losses by
                  selling stocks that have cratered.

                  The fact that so many funds are enduring a flat-to-down 
year in this difficult
                  market has only added to the urgency. Investors aren't fond 
of getting stuck
                  with taxable distributions in even the most flush years of 
a bull market. So
                  managers are now trading in fear of how their shareholders 
will react to funds'
                  kicking off gains distributions in a year when the value of 
their holdings fails to
                  appreciate or, worse, falls outright. With the majority of 
funds operating on an
                  October 31 fiscal year end, and given a trend toward 
letting investors know
                  their estimated tax hit well before year's end, much of 
this selling has been
                  concentrated in a brief period of weeks.

                  One fund executive attending a Fidelity mutual-fund 
conference last week
                  reported that, oddly, some managers have resolved to be 
contrary and
                  "overdo it" in selling even their winners. The theory, he 
reports, is that if
                  they're going to have a capital-gains distribution anyway, 
the most skittish
                  shareholders will sell the fund to avoid the payout and its 
tax liability, whether
                  it's, say, either 10% or 12% of net asset value. So the 
idea is to take profits
                  and "reload" for the benefit of those investors who will 
stick around.

                  Now, with the Nasdaq off 22.7% since Labor Day and 8% so 
far in
                  October, much talk is bubbling about suggesting that the 
assault is ending.
                  This line of reasoning counsels that it's time to peek out 
of the foxhole and
                  survey the wreckage for some badly damaged stocks to pick 
up in
                  expectation of a late-year rally.

                  Not so fast. While it's true that in past years, these 
hard-hit tax-selling victims
                  tend to recover in the early part of November, the move 
often proves fleeting.
                  Like a ball being held under water, these stocks jump when 
the downward
                  pressure is released, but that doesn't mean they escape 
gravity's pull for long.
                  Soon enough, they're hit by a secondary wave of selling by 
investors who tidy
                  up their tax situation closer to the end of the year.

                  The quantitative equity research team at Lehman Brothers 
has studied recent
                  market history in search of patterns in tax-driven selling. 
In the process, the
                  analysts came up with a list of 131 stocks that look 
vulnerable to persistent
                  weakness through most of the fourth quarter. The study 
scanned the Russell
                  3000 index -- basically the 3,000 largest U.S. stocks -- 
for those that had
                  fallen at least 40% this year through September, and had 
lost at least 10% in
                  the prior six months. They also plucked only those stocks 
that had seen rising
                  trading volume over that period. The idea was to find only 
those names that
                  seem to be in the throes of a selling crescendo. In 1997, 
there were just eight
                  such stocks. In 1998, there were 202 and last year 101, on 
a par with this
                  year's tired crop.

                  Murali Ramaswami of Lehman says, "There's both a tax-loss 
story and a
                  momentum story. Losers continue to be losers." At least 
through the fourth
                  quarter they do.

                                       The negative momentum of these stocks 
tends to
                                       gather speed from the first week of 
November to
                  Christmas. In this period, from 1997 through last year, the 
Losers Portfolio
                  dropped an average of 20% more than did the Russell 3000 
index.
                  Bottom-fishers, beware.

                  The resulting list, which Lehman billed to its 
institutional clients as a menu for
                  hungry short-sellers, features numerous stocks caught in 
the major downside
                  themes of the year. Name a major telecom-services provider 
and the odds
                  are good it's in this bunch, the result of a stampede away 
from the group. Big
                  retailers also dot the down-on-their-luck roster, as the 
slowing economy has
                  ravaged shares of Circuit City, Dillards, Saks and others. 
And of course there
                  are plenty of dot.com names experiencing the ugly side of a 
mania undone, in
                  a reversal that has made some mere flyspecks on the 
market's windshield.
                  Witness Barnesandnoble.com and Razorfish.

                  An intrepid prospector surveying this list in a quest for 
next year's Comeback
                  Stock of the Year will encounter no shortage of companies 
that appear, for
                  the moment, broken and in need of an inspired strategic 
revamping, some
                  slick investor-relations work and plenty of luck. Former 
blue chips such as
                  Lucent Technologies, Bausch & Lomb and Dial seem to fall 
into that club,
                  where for investors a love of dirt-cheap stocks and a 
strong backbone is the
                  price of admission. DuPont, which recently ratcheted down 
its 2001 growth
                  forecast and is beset by high raw-materials costs, is 
arguably apt to remain in
                  the investors' time-out chair for a while as well. That its 
shares failed to sell off
                  after a limp earnings report last week is perhaps the most 
hopeful sign one can
                  seize on with regard to the chemicals giant.

                  Still, for the investor patient enough to endure what could 
be a stormy
                  November and December, a few sizable companies with 
temporary problems
                  but solid long-term growth stories are attracting some fund 
managers looking
                  to buy. As detailed in Barron's last week ("Retailers on 
Sale," October 23),
                  there is reason to expect better performance from selected 
retail chains.
                  Federated Department Stores, the parent of Macy's and 
Bloomingdale's,
                  merits attention both for its buoyant same-store sales 
growth in a retail
                  headwind and for its repair of the addled Fingerhut 
catalogue division, which
                  suffered a spike in delinquencies. The shares are off their 
trough levels in the
                  low 20s, but a recent quote of 28 still seems a 
better-than-fair price for a
                  company that some pros believe could earn more than $5 a 
share next year.

                  The advertising business this year is being given the cold 
shoulder by investors
                  after a torrid love affair through 1999. Fearing that the 
dot.com washout and
                  resultant cash drought would wither the bottom line of ad 
firms, investors
                  abandoned Interpublic, the third-largest owner of ad 
agencies after WPP and
                  Omnicom.

                  But Mark Greenberg, manager of the Invesco Leisure fund, 
saw a chance to
                  pick up a "good, solid company" inexpensively when 
Interpublic hit the low
                  30s. Now at 39, Interpublic is still fetching just 22 times 
forecast 2001
                  earnings, which are expected to grow 15%, faster than 
profits for the overall
                  market.

                  "I bought some early this year and added to it just 
recently. The bad news is
                  probably priced into the stock, and then some," he says.

                  Madison Avenue markdown

                  Interpublic, parent of McCann Erickson, among other firms, 
has always
                  suffered a bit in comparison with Omnicom, a market darling 
considered the
                  class operator in the industry. But Interpublic now trades 
at a discounted
                  valuation, and is briskly expanding its direct-marketing 
and public-relations
                  business, which are growing faster than the traditional 
Madison Avenue game.
                  Add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes 
from dot.coms and that
                  half its revenues are collected overseas, and Interpublic 
appears well insulated
                  from crippling economic forces.

                  In a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits Valassis 
Communications, a
                  big coupon distributor, which produces the colorful inserts 
that fall out of your
                  Sunday paper. A well-loved growth stock that pleased many a 
small and
                  mid-cap fund manager in 1999, Valassis this year ran into a 
nettlesome
                  combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price 
competition in one of its
                  insert categories. Investors bailed out in droves, halving 
the stock from a high
                  above 44 to just north of 20. Now at 25, the shares are 
"absurdly cheap,"
                  says Greenberg, who also owns Valassis.

                  Another fund manager points out that the company has taken 
control of its
                  troubles, with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply 
in products
                  where pricing declined. Even with its growth forecast 
revised downward,
                  Valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10%-15% 
long-term rate, and
                  earnings next year should rise close to 12%, to $2.50 a 
share. That leaves the
                  stock at a mere 10 times next year's profits. And it's 
worth noting that in times
                  of slower economic growth, coupons are among the things 
that companies
                  continue to offer to bargain-hunters.

                  With a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard 
stocks any
                  week now, it might feel as if the typical first-quarter 
rebound in the year's
                  losers that's been documented by Lehman Brothers is 
hopelessly distant.

                  If you're tempted nonetheless to plunge ahead and buy a 
beaten-down mutual
                  fund, check first to see if it will be among those making a 
capital-gains
                  distribution later this year. In that case, you'll be on 
the hook for the tax even
                  though you didn't participate in the gain. (You can take 
the plunge without
                  worrying about payouts if you're buying the fund for a 
tax-deferred account
                  such as a 401(k) or an IRA.)

                  But at least in selected stocks, it seems the machinations 
of tax-fearing
                  investors have created the stock market equivalent of a 
25%-off sale, and you
                  don't need to redeem a manufacturer's coupon to take 
advantage.

Shirley,

I hope it's OK with the apartment company.

Hi All,

I am hoping to come to Houston from the 5th to the 17th of November.
Sorry about the short notice.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Cindy,

Hopefully the paper John Martin and I will work will become the
standard reference for this topic.

Vince

Good morning Vince,

Could you please provide with some guidance in relation to Mark's comments 
directly below.  I don't have any recollection of recent case studies that we 
could send Oddbjorn Tysnes - do you know of any?

I will send him a number of reprints of articles.  Please let me know if you 
have anything at your fingertips....

Regards,

Cindy

I don't want to spend a lot of time right now, from this office, pursuing 
these opportunities.  But, if we have some case studies "on the shelf" we 
could send something to Oddbjorn.

Thanks, 

Mark

Dear Mark,

I want to thank you for two very interesting days and a very pleasant
evening in London at the European PR conference.

As you may remember from the session "Ideas Forum", I presented an idea of
introducing Enron's transformation from an "old" industry/energy company to
an innovative player in the "new" economy as a case study at the leading
Nordic business schools. I have later discussed the idea with Enron's head
of the Nordic region, Thor Lien. He agrees that this could be a good way of
raising the awareness of Enron in the Nordic business community. One reason
for this is that several professors of the Nordic business schools are
frequent speakers at business conferences, they are very often sought by
business reporters to give comments etc. If Enron becomes a "top of mind"
innovative company with these professors, it will help relation-building and
PR work towards the business community.

I understood from you that some US business schools have developed similar
(?) case studies on Enron. Do you or someone else in Enron have access to
such case studies? If so, would it be possible for you to send us copies? It
would be a great help for us.

Best regards,
Oddbjorn Tysnes

Vince,
 We wanted to thank you for your time and support today.  We have been 
thinking about our conversation and it may be better to wait until December 
before you approached Delainey.  This time period would give us the 
opportunity to change his impression of our contributions to gas and power.  
Please let us know if you would advise differently.

Thank you,

Kristin and John  

Alex,

Can you set up a meeting to review this product. They have an office in 
Houston.

Please, invite people on the distribution list.

Mr.  Kaminski,
?
Nick Perry and I  were recently discussing the conference in Paris, and we 
gathered that you had  some interest in exploring possible uses of our new 
WeatherDelta tool-kit.?  It is the only application that we know of, that 
can?model temperature,  loads, and power prices in several locations 
simultaneously: thus allowing the  user to measure the value an risk in a 
variety of financial instruments,  physical obligations and assets.? I have 
attached the product overview  sheet, and would be happy to discuss its 
capabilities with you at your  convenience.??

Scott,

Not at all. I left to make a quick call and it required a number
of follow-up calls. 

The presentation was very interesting and professional.

One of the guidelines we have in my group is to avoid using too many software 
packages.
Otherwise, everybody will have his own pet package and we shall lose 
economies of scale.

I shall talk to my associates about your product  and get back to you.

Vince

Scott Wakefield <scottw@mathworks.com> on 10/23/2000 12:09:46 PM
Hello Vince,

I'm writing to follow up with you regarding our meeting last week.  Did we
do something wrong in our presentation or in the set up of this presentation?

For a group of 50 researchers we were expecting a larger crowd and also
some peole perhaps from your IT department.  Also when you left I was
wondering if we had offended you.

The ability to use our products to create open models, integrate databases,
C, VB, etc. and then quickly deploy them to others has been embraced by
the risk management world.  We met the following day with a large group
from EES and they seemed quite enthusiastic about the innovation possible
with our tools.

I realize you are quite busy, but could you please let me know what
happened and how we can prevent this in the future?

Thanks

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk 
September 15, 2000
Raymond Cote
Vice  President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that 
combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and 
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

I am a Managing Director, Research.

Please, feel free to give my E-mail address.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I hope I got your title right. I looked everywhere  for it and I could not 
find it. In one of the numerous discussions I had with  professor Shreve 
about you I remember having heard "head of research"...  probably energy, but 
that I could not recall. Is this ok? Also I would like to have the title of 
the conference, it is useful!  
?
Finnally, there is a request for your e-mail by a  PHD student, Do you allow 
me to provide this info?
?
?
Sincerely,

John,

I can extract the curves from the database.

Thanks.

numbers to forward or would someone in our group need to help him?

Vince J Kaminski
10/27/2000 04:24 PM
John,

I am forwarding to you the request by Jens.  We gave in the past 
our forward oil curves (with approval of Greg Whalley) to some academics.
What is your position on this request?

Vince

Jens Gobel@ENRON
10/26/2000 12:06 PM
Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM
Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

Olaf Korn

p.s. Bei Rueckfragen stehe ich Ihnen jederzeit gern zur Verfuegung

Ted,

I agree. Curve review has always been RAC responsibility. Please, let me know 
if we can assist you in any way.

Tani,
Please touch base with Lloyd Fleming as to whom from RAC should review the 
methodology.  I view that it is the commercial team's responsibility to post 
the curve, operations responsibility to gather objective information on the 
efficacy of the curve on a (minimum) monthly basis and report all highly 
sensitive curves, RAC will not approve or disapprove a curve but question 
methodology/motivations and subsequent changes and do so in a senior 
management forum (i.e., we will tell on those who have suspect curves or 
curve movements).  Obviously, we are looking for the best estimate of the 
value of those products in those time buckets TODAY, we also favor object, 
consistent application of methodoology intra and inter commodity.

Vince J Kaminski
10/27/2000 04:18 PM

No problem. We shall look at the curve on Monday. I have organized a  small

the curve from different perspectives.

Curve validation is normally a RAC prerogative and I shall get them involved 
on Monday

Following Steve's note to you earlier today, I wanted to mention that we have 
a fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular, as there 
is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days.

I am not sure what data you have received from Enron Metals in London, so I 
am asking Tim Poullain-Patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the 
economic justification proposed as soon as possible.  Please direct any 
questions to him or to Harry Tefoglou.  I will be in the Tokyo office next 
week, but available via e-mail.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Tani  

Tani,

Ted Murphy sees the curve validation issue as the RAC prerogative. I shall 
contact him and offer our help
in the curve review process.

Gentlemen:

We have had favorable responses regarding the use of our Volatility
Reduction Method (Roger, I've attached a copy of our article in case you
hadn't seen it).  However, there continued to be a quibble about how to
create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process.

Last week the consulting arm of a "Big Five" accounting firm indicated that
the following method proposed by us would be acceptable.  We believe this
method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest
rate differences from overlapping ("rolling") quarters.

Method:

1)Calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios, using historical
rates from the most recent, say, two years. (Note: no overlap).  This
results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios (approximately 247 trading
days per
year).

Example:
If the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this:
19980801   6.5  6.6  6.7  .........  7.2
19980802   6.3  6.3  6.6  .........  6.9
19980803   6.6  6.8  6.9  .........  7.1

Then the change from 8/1/98 to 8/2/98 is:
6.3/6.5   6.3/6.6   6.6/6.7 .......... 6.9/7.1

And the change from 8/2/98 to 8/3/98 is:
6.6/6.3  6.8/6.3  6.9/6.6  ......... 7.1/6.9

2)Randomly select 62 of these "ratio" vectors (approx. 62 trading days in a
quarter).

3)Multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector (ie, the 62
6mo ratios are multiplied together, the 62 1yr ratios are multiplied
togeter, etc.).  The result represents a single quarterly yield curve
transformation.  Apply it to "today's" yield curve.  The resulting yield
curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates

4)Repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are
generated, say 100.

5) Proceed with testing process.

I would be interested in your comments.

Thanks for your message. Look fwd to your call.

As a speaker at EPRM's highly successful Power 2000 event in  Houston, I am 
writing to inform you of our 2001 annual congress and to introduce  myself. I 
will be responsible for the production of all North American EPRM  events 
having moved from our banking conference and training course division in  
July. Just to update you on the whereabouts of the EPRM team, Emma Wolfin is  
developing our technology events for Waters conferences and Joel Hanley will 
be  starting his new role as an EPRM journalist from November 1st.

EPRM 2001 will be held in Houston on the 14th, 15th & 16th  of May and I am 
keen to start the initial research as soon as possible. I intend  to call 
each Power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would  like 
to provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some  
issues.

What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference  
seminars at EPRM 2001?

What research are you or your company involved in that would justify  
inclusion in EPRM 2001?

Aside from your own work, what subjects are currently at the  cutting-edge of 
energy risk management?

Who else would you recommend as a potential speaker? (Regulatory bodies,  
academics, practitioners)

Any assistance at this initial stage of research is  appreciated. You can 
email me or call on +44 20 7484 9883. I look forward to  working with you on 
this event.

10/24/2000 12:17 PM
This morning a draft of RAC's Inflation Model Review was discussed with Anjam.

All points as presented in the draft were agreed upon.

Also, four new points were amended as suggested by Anjam:

The RPI short-term model could be improved by a combination of the 
information available from the GILTS and RPI Swaps market.
Add:  "This is an issue across all Enron's econometric models." to section 
PLLU and DZCV Short-term, First Point.
To implement some of the suggestions requires additional statistical and 
programming resources.
Additionnal human resources with advanced econometric modelling skills are 
required given the current workload of the european research team.

Please find the final version attached.

Please note that the short term solution has been to freeze the curve.

The medium to long term solution involves futher research towards a sounder 
and more efficient model.
Given the current workload of the European Research Group, it is necessary to 
hire a new member of staff with strong economics and econometrics background 
to address this issue properly.

RAC will communicate to the Financial Trading Group and Risk Management the 
actions to take as the curve will be frozen.

Thanks,

Rodrigo

Vince:

I enjoyed the lunch and part of your presentation last week (I had an other
engagement to attend to, and hence could not make it to the rest of the
presentation and reception following it).

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find
the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in
Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between
Austin
and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about
this.
I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level
so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more
importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to
Enron away from my thesis.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

John,

I am forwarding to you the request by Jens.  We gave in the past 
our forward oil curves (with approval of Greg Whalley) to some academics.
What is your position on this request?

Vince

Jens Gobel@ENRON
10/26/2000 12:06 PM
Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM
Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

Olaf Korn

p.s. Bei Rueckfragen stehe ich Ihnen jederzeit gern zur Verfuegung

Following Steve's note to you earlier today, I wanted to mention that we have

is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days.

I am not sure what data you have received from Enron Metals in London, so I 
am asking Tim Poullain-Patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the 
economic justification proposed as soon as possible.  Please direct any 
questions to him or to Harry Tefoglou.  I will be in the Tokyo office next

Curt Randall wants to visit us at our lunch meeting next Friday (Nov. 3).   
He is going to
do a presentation to demo the software from his company SciFinance. 

His visit is subject to change, that is why I want to wait till next week to 
make the announcement.

I appreciate that Stinson agrees to give a talk in the brown bag options 
seminar.  We could move Stinson's talk
to Thursday group meeting if Stinson OK it. Or we can reschedule Stinson's 
talk to the following Friday.   

Let me know your thoughts.

You are welcome.

Shall we say 11:30 to allow some time for getting organized?

I usually use an old fashioned overhead transparency projector if you've
got one.  If they've all been replaced by digital projectors, I can
bring one.

I'll be in touch early that week, to get directions for parking etc.

Naveen,
I was trying to find "fat tails". I looked at NG prompt month prices' 
log-returns for 5 years  9 months.
On the figure below you can see the comparison of empirical cumulative 
probability function with normal 
cumulative for this time series (standardized: mean subtracted, divided by 
stdev). The effect of fat tails
is not pronounced so much. The "fat tails" effect was much more visible on 
your plot when you looked at the 
oct-00 prices log-returns versus my time series of prompt month's prices.
The shape of the distribution is different from normal, though, and fits well 
with the volatility switching model.

Tanya.

I have attached an updated org chart for my team.    

I think the following changes need to be made
1.  Paulo Issler is reporting to Zimin Lu
2.  Shalesh Ganjoo is reporting to me (who does the system show as his 
supervisor, Zimin?)

Also, I just found out that Chonawee did not get his mid-year review.     I 
didn't realize that Samer Takriti never gave him a review.   I have found all 
of the mid-year feedback for Chonawee, but I don't have an official "form" to 
fill out for him to sign.   Can you send one to me, or what should I do?

Thanks,

Dear All,

On 25th October I announced my resignation from Enron Europe to pursue other 
opportunities.  I just wanted to say that the past 3 1/2 years has been a 
very interesting and positive experience for me, having been a key part of 
such a dynamic and fast-moving organisation.  Enron is by far the best 
organisation I have ever worked for, and I am proud to have had the 
opportunity to work here and become a shareholder.  I have found it a real 
pleasure to have worked with such talented and interesting individuals as 
exist within Enron Europe and Enron Corp in Houston & Portland and I 
genuinely wish you the best of success going forward.  I would also like to 
take this opportunity to thank Vince Kaminski, John Sherriff and Richard 
Lewis for hiring me in April 97 and thereafter offering such interesting and 
challenging projects to work on.

I have made some excellent friends at Enron and hope to keep them - I have a 
base in London and will probably be visiting Houston soon, so please feel 
free to stay in touch!

John Sherriff has suggested we all get together in the near future to discuss 
the demands being placed on the Research Group.  I will be making a request 
for additional resources, and the aim of the meeting is to determine the most 
appropriate size for the team.

Assistants:  Can we aim for week commencing 6th November?
Vince: Would you like to teleconference in?

Many thanks
Steve

Steve,

All these provisions make a lot of sense. Anjam showed very poor judgment one 
more time.
He got a very generous offer to move to Houston.

I recommend keeping him on the payroll, and at home, as long as possible.

Vince

Richard Lewis
10/26/2000 04:41 AM
I will sit Anjam down before he leaves and explain the confidentiality 
provisions in his contract and that we will pursue them vigorously.  Melanie 
- can you give me a copy, Steve, let me know when he is leaving - I'll do it 
closer to the time.

Richard

Steven Leppard
26/10/2000 10:13
All

My preferred approach to dealing with Anjam's departure is given below.  
These recommendations are informed by the fact that I don't feel Anjam has 
much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from 
Enron:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know 
our positions and curves next.

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from

This message is pertaining to the celebration the Weather Team
had with Mike Roberts.

We celebrated with Mike on Boss's Day Oct. 16th.

We the  Weather Team felt that time spent with our Boss was 
just as valuable as any token of appreciation.

We did Happy Hour @ Ninfa's

Mike you will not have a token in the staff meeting today 
however, please know that you are a great Boss too.

We still would like for you to join the others in celebrating
and we would like to have lunch with you.

                                         Thanks
                                     Kevin Moore

Hope to see you there !

Martin,

Can you, please, call Shu and provide him with information about EBS?

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at IEOR very much.
I wonder if you could point me to some information
resource on Enron's bandwidth market.

I am a Ph.D student at IEOR. I work with Professor
Oren and Professor Varaiya from EECS department on
the topic of pricing the Internet. In particular, I am designing
pricing mechanism in the framework of the DiffServ
architecture which is the latest proposal made by
IETF to provide scalable service differentiation.
I would very much like to get in touch with people
in Enron working on the similar topics.

Thank you very much.

Kevin,

I would greatly appreciate if you could help me in this case. Yaron's father 
helped me 
a lot to open many doors at Berkeley.

Vince,
Kevin Hannon is the executive lead for Cornell and he needs to approve.   I 
am not sure if they have already interviewed on campus.  He should go through 
the on-campus screening process before attending a Super Saturday.  We are 
reserving the Super Saturday weekend for individuals that are highly likely 
to receive an offer.  I will forward this to Kevin and Kristin Gandy.  
Although they are responsible for Graduate recruiting at Cornell, perhaps it 
is possible for him to interview when they go on campus.
Charlene

Kevin and Kristin,
Please see Vince's message below. Would it be possible for an undergraduate 
to interview while you are at Cornell?  Please let me know.  

Thanks

Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.
